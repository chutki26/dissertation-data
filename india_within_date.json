        "text": "UK PM Rishi Sunak | Photo: ANI   \n         London:  Amid the escalating conflict between the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Hamas militants, the United Kingdom Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, is set to visit the war-torn country later on Thursday. PM Sunak’s visit is coming after United States President Joe Biden met with Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on Sunday. During his visit, he will meet with the top leaders there to discuss Israel’s ongoing war with Hamas militants and express solidarity. Reuters reported this, citing the UK PM’s office.  \n             \n United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will travel to Israel and meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog, before travelling on to other regional capitals, reports Reuters citing UK PM’s office \n (File pic)  pic.twitter.com/KFRVI3tnmz \n — ANI (@ANI)  October 18, 2023 As per UK PMO, PM Sunak will meet Israel Prime Minister and President Isaac Herzog and will share his condolences for the loss of life in Israel and Gaza as a result of the October 7 attack on Israel. “Every civilian death is a tragedy. And too many lives have been lost following Hamas’ horrific act of terror,” Sunak said in a statement ahead of his visit, according to Reuters. \n             \n           According to Reuters, the UK PM will call for the opening of route to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza as soon as possible. He will also talk in regards to departing British nationals trapped in Gaza. Earlier, Sunak condemned the attack on the recent Gaza hospital, that killed hundreds of people. Taking to X (former Twitter) he wrote, “We are all shocked by the scenes at the al-Ahli Arab Hospital. Our intelligence services are rapidly analysing the evidence to independently establish the facts,” he posted. Thousands of people have lost their lives as the war between IDF and Hamas escalating everyday. However, since the starting of the war, international organisation including the United Nations mounting pressure for an immediate ceasefire and a return to the negotiating table to resolve the long-standing Israel-Palestine conflict. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Netanyahu spokesperson Tal Heinrich told CNN that the IDF “does not target hospitals.” “We only target Hamas strongholds, arms depots, and terror targets,” he added. The remarks came after Palestinian sources claimed that initial estimates suggest that the attack on the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City resulted in 200 to 300 fatalities. On Tuesday, an explosion at a hospital in Gaza City reportedly resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people, as per health authorities in the Hamas-controlled enclave, as reported by Reuters. A Gaza civil defense chief claimed on Al-Jazeera television that over 300 people were killed in the hospital explosion. Expressing his solidarity with the nation, United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak stated on Monday that the attacks in Israel last weekend were shocking to the world. He described how people of all ages, including the elderly, men, women, children, and infants, suffered tragic fates. During an update to the House of Commons on the latest situation in Israel and Gaza, Sunak pledged full support for Israel from the UK. “The attacks in Israel last weekend shocked the world. Over 1,400 people were murdered, over 3,500 wounded, almost 200 taken hostage. The elderly, men, women, children, and babies in arms were murdered, mutilated and burned alive. It was a pogrom…We stand with Israel. The murdered and the missing come from over 30 countries, including the United Kingdom. At least six British citizens were killed and ten are missing…We are working with Israel to establish the effects as quickly as possible…we are also helping British citizens who want to leave Israel,” Sunak said in the Parliament. “I want to address the British Jewish community directly…we stand with you now and always. This atrocity was an existential strike at the very idea of Israel as a safe homeland for the Jewish people. We are doing everything that we can to protect you…,” he added. Speaking further, the UK Prime Minister said that Hamas is using innocent Palestinians as human shields,” adding that Britain mourns the loss of every innocent life. “Hamas is using innocent Palestinian people as human shields. With the tragic loss of more than 2,600 Palestinian lives, including many children, we mourn the loss of every innocent life. Civilians of every faith, every nationality, who have been killed…I believe we must support Israel’s right to defend itself, to go after Hamas, take back the hostages, deter further incursions, and strengthen its security for the long term…,” he said. Sunak also stressed that Palestinians are, too the victims of Hamas and urged for immediate humanitarian support for people living in Gaza. He said, “We must support the Palestinian people because they are victims of Hamas too. We believe that Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people or their legitimate aspirations to live with equal measures of security, freedom, justice, opportunity, and dignity.” “Hamas simply does not stand for the future that the Palestinians want, and they seek to put the Palestinian people in harm’s way. So we must ensure humanitarian support urgently reaches civilians in Gaza. This requires Egypt and Israel to allow the aid that is so badly needed,” he added.",

        "description": "Israel PM Netanyahu has stressed on achieving 'demilitarisation' of Gaza and has alsosaid that there will be a civil government in that area which will not educate children about 'destroying Israel'.",
        "text": "Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu   \n         New Delhi:  The  Israel Palestine Conflict  turned into a full-fledged  Israel Hamas War  on October 6, 2023 when P alestinian Islamist Organisation Hamas  fired 5000 rockets on Israel from the conflicted Gaza Strip, killing multiple people. The war has been raging on for the last two-and-a-half-months and despite the few days of temporary ceasefire, there has been mass destruction and loss of life in both the countries. In a latest update,  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  has stressed on achieving ‘demilitarisation’ of Gaza and that they will not allow ‘Hamastan’ to become ‘Fatahastan’.  \n             PM Netanyahu On ‘Demilitarisation’ Of Gaza Stressing achieving “demilitarisation” of Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he will never allow Palestinian authority to return to the strip, adding that there will be a ‘civil government’ that won’t educate children about “destroying Israel,” Times of Israel reported. He said that Israel won’t allow ‘Hamastan’ to turn into ‘Fatahstan’ even if this is the wish of Israel’s “staunchest ally,” referring to the US. Netanyahu also cited a survey that found 82 per cent of Palestinians in the West Bank justified the October 7 attacks on Israel, adding that the Palestinian authority has yet to condemn the assault. “They should control Gaza?” he asked, referring to the Palestinian Authority, and stressed that he “won’t let that happen.” Israeli PM’s Vision For Gaza After War On being asked about his vision for Gaza after the war, Netanyahu said, “I said there will be demilitarisation. I said the IDF will be responsible for security in the Gaza Strip because there is no other factor that will ensure the fight against terrorism. And I can tell you that there will be a civil government that does not educate its children to destroy Israel…I’m very clear on this.” He further said that it was “only military pressure” that secured the release of hostages in last month’s truce and only military pressure will secure the release of the rest of the hostages as well. “Without it, we have nothing,” he added. The Israeli PM also stressed the diplomatic situation on the northern border of Israel after the IDF achieved a “crushing victory” over Hamas. “First, there needs to be ‘crushing victory’ over Hamas, with Hezbollah deterred in the north, he says. Once Hamas is destroyed, Israel will focus on the north, where almost 100,000 Israelis are currently displaced from their homes,” Netanyahu said. “Either there will be a diplomatic situation on the northern border, or there will be a different way to solve the situation,” he added. \n             \n           PM Netanyahu On Oslo Accords In another major statement, Netanyahu said that he is being blamed for putting “brakes” on the Oslo Accords, but said he is “proud” of preventing the Palestinian state. “I inherited the Oslo Accords,” he said. “The decision to bring the PLO from Tunis, and plant it in the heart of Judea and Samaria [West Bank], and in Gaza, was a decision made and implemented before I became prime minister. I thought it was a terrible mistake and I still do.” “You and your journalist friends have been blaming me for almost 30 years for putting the brakes on the Oslo Accords and preventing the Palestinian state. That’s true,” Netanyahu said. He added, “I’m proud that I prevented the establishment of a Palestinian state because today everybody understands what that Palestine state could have been, now that we’ve seen the little Palestinian state in Gaza. Everyone understands what would have happened if we had capitulated to international pressures and enabled a state like that in Judea and Samaria, surrounding Jerusalem and on the outskirts of Tel Aviv.” (Inputs from ANI)",

The military group named the commander as Sami Abdallah, alias Abu Taleb, born in 1969, and reported his death “with great pride and great honour”.  \n             A Lebanese military source told news agency AFP that the commander was “the most important in Hezbollah to be killed up to now since the start of the war” between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza, which has fuelled violence on the Lebanese border. Notably, the Israeli strike hit the town of Jouaiyya, 15 kilometres (nine miles) from the Israeli border, and also killed three other people. In the meantime, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) reported that Israel Air Force fighter jets attacked a military compound of Hezbollah’s Unit 4400 – the logistical reinforcement unit of the terrorist organisation – which serves in transporting weapons to Lebanon and within Lebanon. \n             \n           In the complex, two centers located in the area of Baalbek in Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley, northeast of Beirut were attacked.

        "description": "The G7 Leaders also discussed major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China’s industrial policy and economic security.",
        "text": "Savelletri Di Fasano: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other leaders during the G7 Outreach Session, in Savelletri Di Fasano, Italy, Friday, June 14, 2024. (PTI Photo)     \n         The Group of Seven leading industrialized nations turned their attention to migration, artificial intelligence, economic security and the Indo-Pacific region on Friday, the second and final day of their summit in Italy. The G7 leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges “at a crucial moment in history.” The gathering in a luxury resort in Italy’s southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality and China’s industrial policy and economic security.  \n             “We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,” the G7 leaders said in a final communique, noting their solidarity with Ukraine, support for a deal that would lead to an immediate cease-fire and release of hostages in Gaza, investment in sustainable infrastructure in Africa and commitments to address climate change and migration. Divisions did emerge during the summit, however, notably over the lack of a reference to abortion in the summit’s final declaration. Asked if the G7 gathering has lived up to expectations, French President Emmanuel Macron was circumspect. “The aim of the G7 is to create convergence and be able to remove misunderstandings. It’s not a place where you decide emergency measures or regulate things,” he said, adding that there was “true convergences on Ukraine and Mideast.” \n             \n           “It was a useful G7, with useful results,” Macron said. “The coming weeks will create the conditions for political opportunities in particular around the two conflicts.” Discussions on Migration Migration was the first topic of discussions Friday, with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys. The issue is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Right-wing Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hard-line stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe. The leaders “launched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants,” the summit’s final declaration said, noting the seven nations would “focus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organized crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration.” British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he and Meloni – who he described as “fantastic” – saw “eye to eye” on migration. “We can’t have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,” Sunak said. Meloni has a controversial five-year deal with neighboring Albania for the Balkan country to host thousands of asylum-seekers while Italy processes their claims. She has also spearheaded the “Mattei Plan” for Africa, a continent-wide strategy to increase economic opportunities at home and so discourage migration. For its part, Britain has a deal to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, although no flights have yet taken off. Human rights organizations have blasted the agreement as unethical and unworkable. The United States has also been struggling with a growing number of migrants. President Joe Biden introduced new policies to curb migration after a bill he tried to get through Congress failed to pass. However, the future of the new policies is unclear after immigrant rights advocates challenged them with lawsuits. Apart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the U.S., the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders — Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied — to press Meloni’s migration and development initiatives. But rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries. The ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7 and EU institutions’ share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973. “Without any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,” said David McNair, executive director at The ONE Campaign. Although the summit’s final statement “reflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available.” Pope Francis also became the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, delivering a speech on artificial intelligence. Other invitees include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Support for Ukraine The summit opened Thursday with a strong show of support for Kyiv: an agreement on a U.S. proposal to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral. Russian President Vladimir Putin denounced the freezing of Russian assets as “theft” and vowed it “will not go unpunished.” Biden also signed a bilateral security agreement with Zelenskyy, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv. Lack of reference to abortion But some cracks appeared among the G7 leaders, notably French President Emmanuel Macron deploring a lack of a reference to abortion in the summit’s final document. The statement after last year’s summit in Hiroshima, Japan, expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and the rights of members of the LGBTQ+ community. The word “abortion” was absent from this year’s final communique, although it included a reference to promoting sexual and reproductive health rights. “It was not possible to reach agreement on these things in the room,” a senior EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private discussions. Asked on Thursday about reports that abortion would not be included in the final text, Macron said it was something he regretted. France “has included women’s right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one’s own body, into its Constitution,” he said, adding that France defends “this vision of equality between women and men.” “It’s not a vision that’s shared across all the political spectrum,” Macron said, replying to a question from a reporter. Meloni, who campaigned on a “God, Family, Fatherland” motto, has denied she is rolling back rights to abortions, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the center-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.",

        "title": "8 Israeli Soldiers Killed In Rafah In One Of The Deadliest Incidents For IDF In 6 Months",
        "description": "At least eight Israeli soldiers were killed in an explosion in Gaza's Rafah on Sunday morning.",
        "text": "Earlier this week, a 28-year-old Israeli man in the Lower Galilee was hospitalized with shrapnel injuries during Hezbollah's rocket barrage.   \n         Tel Aviv:  A devastating blast in southern Gaza’s Rafah claimed the lives of eight Israeli servicemen on Sunday morning. This distressing event marks the most severe loss the IDF has suffered in the Strip since the start of the year, as per reports from the Times of Israel. Among the brave souls who made their ultimate sacrifice was a young officer, 23-year-old Cpt Wassem Mahmoud. He hailed from Beit Jann and served as a deputy company commander in the Combat Engineering Corps’ 601st Battalion. Information about the remaining seven soldiers will be made public once their loved ones have been suitably notified.  \n             Initial findings from an IDF investigation indicate that the soldiers were inside a Namer armoured combat engineering vehicle (CEV) when the explosion occurred. The incident took place around 5 am as the convoy, following an overnight offensive against Hamas in Rafah’s Tel Sultan neighbourhood, was en route to secure buildings for rest, as reported by The Times of Israel. The Namer CEV, positioned as the fifth or sixth vehicle in the convoy, was struck by a powerful explosion. It remains unclear whether the blast resulted from a pre-planted bomb or if Hamas operatives directly placed an explosive device on the vehicle. Investigators are also considering whether explosives stored outside the CEV contributed to the intensity of the explosion. According to the IDF, there was no exchange of gunfire during the incident, and the vehicle was in motion at the time of the explosion. \n             \n           The deaths of these soldiers bring the total toll of IDF casualties during the ground offensive against Hamas and operations along the Gaza border to 307. This figure includes a police officer killed in a recent hostage rescue operation and a civilian Defense Ministry contractor also lost in the conflict, according to The Times of Israel. The deadliest incident prior to today’s tragedy occurred in January, when 21 soldiers perished in a blast triggered by Hamas RPG fire that resulted in the collapse of two buildings. The IDF continues to investigate the circumstances surrounding today’s devastating loss, emphasising the ongoing challenges and risks faced by military personnel operating in volatile regions, The Times of Israel reported.",

        "description": "G7 Summit has laid emphasis on the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) to improve strategies ties among the countries.",
        "text": "G7 Summit Emphasizes India-Europe Corridor Amid West Asia Tensions; China Poses A Potential Challenge   \n         The recently concluded G7 Summit in Italy, which saw the presence of world leaders, emphasized the importance of the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) to strengthen strategic ties among the countries. However, tensions in West Asia may have delayed the project. On June 14, the communique was issued following the customary “family photo” at Borgo Egnazia in Italy. During the G7 summit, the leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to a “free and open Indo-Pacific” based on the rule of law.  \n             “We will further promote concrete G7 PGII (Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment) initiatives, flagship projects, and complementary initiatives to develop transformative economic corridors for quality infrastructure and investment, such as the deepening of our coordination and financing for the Lobito Corridor, the Luzon Corridor, the Middle Corridor, and the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, also building on the EU Global Gateway, the Great Green Wall Initiative, and the Mattei Plan for Africa launched by Italy,” the communique read. \nIt is worth noting that India has already initiated its part of work on the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor which was announced last year on the sidelines of the G20 Leaders Summit in Delhi. However, there is lack of rail links in Saudi Arabia and other countries that need to be constructed and linked. India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor The IMEC is a diligent endeavor to foster and enhance commerce between India, regions across the Arabian Peninsula, Mediterranean zone, Europe and possibly Africa by developing and expanding indispensable infrastructure elements like ports, railways, road networks, sea routes, and pipelines. The project’s Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was collaboratively inked in New Delhi in September 2023, amidst the proceedings of the G-20 summit by various countries including India, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), France, Germany, Italy, the United States, and the EU. Nations like Israel and Greece have also evinced their interest in actively participating in this project. The Geopolitical Implications? The October 7 Hamas attacks and ongoing Gaza tumult with Israel has left the IMEC with a fresh set of challenges. Jordan’s citizens; especially those of Palestinian origin, are vehemently against the notion of any projects that bridges the gap between Jordan and Israel. Standing firm against Israel’s aggressive stance in Gaza, the Jordanian government’s position is highlighted by The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \n             \n           There’s a strand of thought arguing that the troublesome situations spurred by the upheaval in the Red Sea region could’ve been alleviated by IMEC’s intervention— possibly ensuring the smoother transportation of goods towards Europe. Yemen’s Houthi rebels recent assault resulted in substantial shipping delays in the Red Sea, forcing the ships to take prolonged routes. Seen as an allied effort to fortify strategic power, IMEC gets juxtaposed to China’s controversial Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)— often put in the negative light for lacking transparency and not respecting national sovereignty. How IMEC Crucial For India? India’s government has set its sights on intensifying commerce and economic relations with the countries of the Arab Gulf. The main vehicle to achieve this is the IMEC initiative, which presents a promising avenue for growth. The initiative aims to tackle gaps in infrastructure and connectivity, thus further cementing India’s ties not just with the Arab Gulf, but with regional allies such as Israel and Jordan. This move paves the way for Indian corporations to explore investment opportunities in the development of the required infrastructure. Also, the IMEC opens the door to a potentially quicker route to the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Europe, avoiding the usual checkpoints at Bab al-Mandab and the Suez Canal. Supporting the IMEC lines up with India’s broader aspirations of taking a lead in the global circuit, building on its improving economic conditions since 1991 and its active participation in the G20. Is China A Threat? Despite the U.S. championing the International Maritime East-West Corridor as a competitor to the Belt and Road Initiative, China’s sway along its potential path is undeniable. One of the key points of this corridor is the port of Piraeus in Greece, the biggest port in Eastern Europe, set to receive cargo from Haifa port, Israel. It’s worth noting that since 2016, Chinese shipping giant, Cosco, has held the lion’s share of the port after acquiring a two-thirds stake from the Greek government. This gives Cosco the power to guide its future, supervising the piers and terminals, as highlighted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Moreover, the robust economic ties between China and the Arab Gulf nations might be a stumbling block for the corridor’s future. In 2022, the trade flow between Saudi Arabia and China exceeded $106 billion – almost twice the amount when compared to U.S.-Saudi trade. Further, China owns a minority 20% stake in Saudi Arabia’s largest port, the Red Sea Gateway Terminal. Additionally, non-oil trade between China and the United Arab Emirates crossed the $72 billion mark in 2022, with China already funding a series of developmental projects.",

        "text": "Israel Army Defeats Half Of Hamas Forces In Rafah, IDF Says     \n         Israel’s military has said that its troops have defeated about half of the Hamas forces in Gaza’s Rafah. According to a statement issued on Monday by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), soldiers from the 162nd Division, which has been fighting in Rafah for more than 40 days, have killed about “550 militants in the city, while 22 Israeli soldiers lost their lives during the battles”, Xinhua news agency reported. Two of the four Hamas battalions in Rafah are “on the verge of being defeated”, the army said, adding that ground battles are still ongoing against the other two battalions.  \n             The Israeli forces gained “operational control” over the entire area between Gaza and Egypt, known as the Philadelphi Corridor, according to the army. “Now the forces on the ground are working to continue and complete the mission. It is estimated that it will take a few more weeks to complete the mission in Rafah,” the army said. The IDF said Division 162 has effectively defeated two out of Hamas’ remaining four battalions, Yabna and East Rafah, and has gained operational control of 60-70% of Rafah’s territory. About 200 tunnel shafts and 25 tunnel routes, some crossing to Egypt and suspected to be utilized for smuggling activities, have been located, according to the statement. \n             \n           The IDF has effectively neutralized most of the Rafah Brigade’s assets, including the tunnel system, command systems, armaments, and combat infrastructure. The headquarters and intelligence systems of the Rafah Brigade are now under IDF control. Israel Hayom reports that the IDF discovered artifacts and intelligence related to Israeli hostages in Rafah. Despite this success, a considerable number of Hamas forces were able to escape Rafah, possibly taking Israeli captives with them as they fled to the al-Mawasi humanitarian zone. The IDF now controls the neighborhoods of Brazil, Shabura, NPK, the Philadelphi Corridor all the way to the sea, and the area between Philadelphi and Tel al-Sultan.",

        "description": "The two members, War Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, resigned from the Israeli PM's small war cabinet last week amid disagreements over the direction of the war in Gaza.",
        "text": "Tel Aviv : Amid intensified war between Israel and Hamas, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dissolved his war cabinet after its two key members resigned, The latest development prompted demands from far-right politicians for representation in the influential group, The Times of Israel reported citing the Prime Minister’s Office.  \n             The two members, War Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, resigned from the Israeli PM’s small war cabinet last week amid disagreements over the direction of the war in Gaza. It should be noted that both the cabinet ministers were former military chiefs and they have been seen as voices of moderation in the five-member body, which was formed in October after the Hamas terror group attacked Southern Israel, The New York Times reported. The establishment of this small war cabinet was a core demand of National Unity Party chair Benny Gantz to join the coalition. \n             \n           Gantz, one of the three cabinet members, quit the coalition last week, and took Gadi Eisenkot along with him, one of the three war cabinet observers. Since the emergency unity government is no more, the war cabinet that emerged as part of that arrangement is no longer relevant, the PMO official stated, reported The Times of Israel. Following the development, Israeli PM Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant will hold small ad hoc consultations with other relevant officials to make key decisions on the war while seeking final approval from the wider security cabinet. Gantz’s decision came at a time when the war between Israel and Hamas is in its eighth month, and the situation in West Asia remains fragile. “Netanyahu is preventing us from advancing towards true victory. That is why we are leaving the emergency government today, with a heavy heart but with full confidence,” Gantz said at a televised news conference last week. “There should be elections that will eventually establish a government that will win the trust of the people and be able to face challenges,” Gantz said, as he called for early polls in the country amid growing outrage among citizens due to the ongoing war. “I call on Netanyahu: set an agreed election date,” he added. In response to Netanyahu’s failure to present a post-war plan for the Gaza Strip, where Israel’s ground offensive has claimed over 37,000 people since October 7, according to Gaza health officials, Gantz, last month threatened to resign from the emergency government, which was established last year to oversee the war in Gaza, according to Al Jazeera.

        "text": "Israel Hikes Quota For Foreign Workers By 14,300 To Fill Labour Shortage Amid War Against Hamas   \n         Tel Aviv : In an effort to address labour shortage in the country, Israel approved a quota of 92,000 foreign workers to fill jobs in agriculture, industry, hotels and restaurants, the Prime Minister’s Office announced on Tuesday. Notably, this is the first time that Israel has authorised foreign workers for the restaurant industry.  \n             It should be noted that nearly 70 percent of the quota is specifically set aside for agricultural laborers. Israeli agriculture is facing staggering losses in production and manpower. Before October 7, Israel had 29,900 foreigners, mostly Thais, working in farms, orchards, greenhouses and packing plants. Israeli workers who might have filled the gaps have been called up for military reserve duty while Palestinian laborers are currently banned as security risks. Many growing areas are within two kilometers of the Lebanese border where farmers have not been able to freely access fields and orchards. “Despite the challenges of the war, the packing house works around the clock, with the aim of providing fresh Israeli produce continuously, while dealing with the directives of the Home Front Command,” said Asaf Keret, CEO of Beresheet, a fruit-packing business jointly run by several kibbutzim in the Upper Galilee and Golan Heights. \n             \n           Keret was addressing a delegation of fruit growers and agricultural officials touring Beresheet’s orchards. He called on the government to boost agriculture with further measures, such as grants for planting, raising lang quotas, and other incentives. “The fruit growers are at the height of the picking season and are faced with picking under the fire of Hezbollah, and we are prepared to market the produce of the farmers of the Galilee and the Golan to the marketing chains and wholesale companies. Thanks to our dedicated farmers and workers, I am sure that we will be able to supply the produce to the residents of the State of Israel,” Keret said. The remaining foreign workers will fill gaps in industry, and hotels, with 2,000 to work for the first time in restaurants. Since October 7, Hezbollah rocket barrages and drone attacks have killed 10 civilians and 15 soldiers. Leaders of the Iran-backed terror group have said they will continue the attacks to prevent thousands of residents of northern Israel from returning to their homes. Israeli officials have been calling for Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from Southern Lebanon in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War.

        "description": "The Canadian government said that the decision to designate the IRGC through the Criminal Code listing regime sends a strong message that Canada will use all tools at its disposal to combat the terrorist activity of the IRGC.",
        "text": "Canada Lists Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps As Terrorist Entity   \n         Ottawa : Canada on Wednesday (local time) listed Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist entity under the Criminal Code after years of mounting pressure. Canada’s Minister of Public Safety, Democratic Institutions and Intergovernmental Affairs, Dominic LeBlanc announced the decision.  \n             In a press release, the Canadian government said, “Based on their actions, there are reasonable grounds to believe that the IRGC has knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in or facilitated a terrorist activity, or has knowingly acted on behalf of, at the direction of, or in association with an entity that has knowingly carried out terrorist activity. Listing the IRGC means that they are a terrorist group.” It said that the decision to designate the IRGC through the Criminal Code listing regime sends a strong message that Canada will use all tools at its disposal to combat the terrorist activity of the IRGC, “conducted both unilaterally and in knowing association with listed terrorist entities such as Hizballah and Hamas.” In a press release, the Canadian government said, “As a now-listed entity, the IRGC meets the definition of a “terrorist group” under Canada’s Criminal Code. As an immediate consequence of this listing, Canadian financial institutions, such as banks and brokerages, are required to immediately freeze the property of a listed entity. It is a criminal offence for anyone in Canada and Canadians abroad to knowingly deal with property owned or controlled by a terrorist group.” \n             \n           In a statement, Dominic LeBlanc said that the Iranian regime has demonstrated a complete disregard for human rights, both inside and outside Iran. LeBlanc said, “The Iranian regime has consistently displayed a complete disregard for human rights, both inside and outside Iran, as well as a willingness to destabilize the international rules-based order.” “Listing the IRGC builds on the Government of Canada’s broader efforts to ensure that there is no impunity for Iran’s unlawful actions and its support of terrorism. Our government will always promote human rights and take action against those seeking to disrupt our way of life, here in Canada and around the world,” he added. This latest development comes after years of pressure on the federal government to designate the IRGC as a terrorist entity. According to a CBC News report, the IRGC is a branch of the Iranian armed forces that reports directly to Iran’s supreme leader. Earlier in 2020, the IRGC shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 above the skies of Tehran, claiming the lives of 175 passengers, including 55 Canadian citizens and 30 permanent residents, CBC News reported. Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Melanie Joly, warned that Canadians in Iran might face a heightened risk of arbitrary detention after the announcement on Wednesday. Joly said, “For those who are in Iran right now, it’s time to come back home. And for those who are planning to go to Iran, don’t go.” The association representing family members of Flight PS752 victims, members of the Iranian Canadian community, the Conservative Party and the NDP have urged the Canadian government to designate the entire militia group as a terrorist entity, according to CBC News report. Hamed Esmaeilion, a board member with the Association of Families of Flight PS752 Victims, said the families were happy to know that the government is moving forward with this designation after they had raised the demand for it at every rally and event they held over the past four years. Esmaeilion, who lost his wife and daughter on Flight PS752, said, “It has been a long journey. Long and painful.” Esmaeilion further said, “It’s very important to punish those people or those organisations that were involved in atrocities against Canadians and Iranians.” Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong said his party has been urging the government to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organisation for six years. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre reiterated his demand to list the IRGC as a terrorist entity after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7. On January 8, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau told victims’ families at a ceremony on the fourth anniversary of the destruction of the plane that his government was looking at ways to “responsibly” move forward with that designation, CBC News reported. He had said, “We know there is more to do to hold the regime to account and we will continue our work, including continuing to look for ways to responsibly list the IRGC as a terrorist organisation. His remarks came after the government for years explained its decision to not designate the IRGC as a terrorist organisation.",

        "description": "Students from India stand to be the largest beneficiaries if Trump is indeed re-elected and delivers on his promise.",
        "text": "Washington:  Former US President Donald Trump has said if he is re-elected, his administration will pursue a programme to grant Green Cards to foreign students automatically upon graduation from American colleges and universities.  \n             Students from India, which is the second largest source country for foreign students, stand to be the largest beneficiaries if Trump is indeed re-elected and delivers on his promise. Together with students from China, which is the top source country, they account for 53 per cent of all foreign students enrolled in 2023. The Trump campaign has already rolled back the former President’s comments already, saying shortly after that the programme will use an “aggressive vetting process” to keep out “all communists, radical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters and public charges (poor foreigners who are unable to fend for themselves and need government)”. \n             \n           Trump’s remarks came in a podcast with two Silicon Valley investors on Thursday. When asked to promise he will bring the best and the brightest from around the world to America, he said: “I do promise, but I happen to agree.” “What I will do is – you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a Green Card to be able to stay in this country, and that includes junior colleges.” A Green Card allows the holder to stay and work in the US permanently – Permanent Residency – and it is a step away from full citizenship. The US grants an estimated 1 million Green Cards every year and it also receives 1 million foreign students every year, mostly from China and India. If the former President does indeed deliver on this promise if elected, it would mark a major expansion of the programme, doubling the number of Green Cards issued annually. But the big question is if he will indeed deliver on this promise. When in office from 2017 to 2021, his administration had tried to restrict the intake of immigrants and, in fact, targeted Indians coming to the US on H-1B short-term non-immigrant work visas. Before taking office, he had supported the H-1B programme. A large majority of Indian students in US schools and colleges go on to work for American companies on H-1B visas and then go on to Green Cards and citizenship. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen are prominent examples. Foreign students have to go through the stage of H-1B or other work visas to get to Green Cards. Former President Trump is promising to remove that stage and grant foreign students Green Cards along with their degrees.",

        "description": "Israel has previously bombed locations in the vicinity of the “humanitarian zone” in Muwasi, a rural area with no water or sewage systems where displaced Palestinians have built tent camps in recent months.",
        "text": "Displaced Palestinians, who fled their houses due to Israeli strikes, shelter at a tent camp, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, February 29, 2024. (REUTERS)   \n         At least 25 people were killed and 50 others were injured in Israeli attacks on tents for displaced Palestinians in al-Mawasi, near Rafah, in the south of the coastal enclave, according to the Gaza health ministry, Al Jazeera reported. Additionally, the Palestinian Civil Defence Agency reported further casualties in the al-Shakoush area due to Israeli shelling. Earlier, the Gaza health ministry said Israel’s military killed at least 35 Palestinians over the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll from the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas to 37,431.  \n             This was the latest deadly attack in the Gaza Strip, where hundreds of thousands have fled fighting between Israel and Hamas. It comes less than a month after an Israeli bombing triggered a deadly fire that tore through a camp for displaced Palestinians in southern Gaza, drawing widespread international outrage — including from some of Israel’s closest allies — over the military’s expanding offensive into Rafah. Witnesses whose relatives died in one of the bombardments near a Red Cross field hospital north of Rafah told The Associated Press that Israeli forces fired a second volley that killed people who came out of their tents. The International Committee of the Red Cross said the hospital was flooded with casualties, including 22 dead and 45 wounded, and condemned the firing of “high-caliber projectiles” a few yards from the facility. Hundreds of people live in tents nearby, including many of the hospital staff, the ICRC said. \n             \n           Israel has previously bombed locations in the vicinity of the “humanitarian zone” in Muwasi, a rural area with no water or sewage systems where displaced Palestinians have built tent camps in recent months. Israel says it is targeting Hamas fighters and infrastructure and that it tries to minimize civilian deaths. It blames the large number of civilian casualties on militants and says it’s because they operate among the population. The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has entered its ninth month, drawing increasing international criticism for the devastating impact on Gaza’s civilian population. The top United Nations court has raised concerns about a ‘plausible risk of genocide’ in Gaza, a claim vehemently denied by Israel. Despite the mounting pressure, Israel continues its military campaign, particularly in the city of Rafah, where over a million Palestinians sought refuge. While many have fled, the United Nations warns that no place in Gaza is truly safe. The dire humanitarian situation is exacerbated by the lack of essential resources like food, water, and medical supplies, leaving families stranded in tents and cramped apartments.",

        "text": "Israel Hamas War Latest update (Reuters)   \n         Israel Hamas War Latest Update:  The decades-old Israel Palestine Conflict turned into a full-fledged Israel Hamas War when the terrorist organisation fired 5000 rockets from Gaza on Israel on October 7, 2023. For the last nearly nine months, the war has been raging on, killing thousands of people in both countries and causing mass destruction which will take decades to be restored. It seems that the ongoing war is now giving rise to internal problems as thousands of people in Israel have been protesting against the current Netanyahu-government, demanding new elections and also return of hostages held in Gaza by the Hamas organisation. The anti-government protests have been going on for quite some time and are only intensifying with time.  \n             Anti-Govt Protests Rise In Israel Amid War With Gaza As mentioned earlier, tens of thousands of people held anti-government protests in several parts of Israel on Saturday night, calling for new elections and the return of hostages held in Gaza, The Times of Israel reported. On Tel Aviv’s Kaplan Street, David Grossman, one of Israel’s best-known authors, urged the people of Israel to fill the streets with demonstrations and fight for their country in a poem he read to protesters. He read, “There’s someone and something to fight for. For such a gift, from life, we will nevermore receive… Now’s the time to rise, to live. To be a people or not to be. To be people or not to be… All hangs by a thread.” Israelis Demand Re-Elections, Call Netanyahu ‘Worst, Most Failed PM’ Former Shin Bet chief, Yuval Diskin called Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “the worst and most failed prime minister in the history of the state.” Diskin, who served as Shin Bet intelligence agency chief from 2005 to 2011, demanded elections at the earliest possible opportunity. “For many weeks, I rejected requests to join the protests. Something deep inside me told me that it wasn’t time yet, that maybe it wasn’t right to change governments during a war, and that unity was the most important thing,” The Times of Israel quoted Diskin as saying. He further added, “But I find myself amazed, every day, by the government’s uselessness, the failed management of the war, the lie of ‘total victory,’ the total evasion of responsibility, the destruction of our strategic relations with the United States, and perhaps most of all, missing every opportunity to return our kidnapped brothers and sisters, who continue to languish in Hamas captivity in Gaza.” \n             \n           Thousands Call For End To Fighting In Gaza In Largest-Ever Protest Since Oct 7 People staged a protest on King George Street, outside Beit Jabotinsky, home to the ruling Likud party’s headquarters. Some protesters held signs demanding early elections, and others held banners calling for an end to the fighting in Gaza. After the main rally ended, several protesters stayed and blocked the road, burning tyres. Mounted police personnel moved in to disperse the crowd, clearing the road and arresting three protesters, The Times of Israel reported. In video footage, police could be seen riding into the crowds, moving protesters aside with their horses. Several people seemed to be pushed around by police, while other protesters attempted to stop police from hurting those being pushed. The protesters included Labor lawmaker Gilad Kariv, who shouted that mounted police to move aside from the sidewalks and warned that their deployment was illegal. Meanwhile, thousands of people held a protest outside Israel PM Netanyahu’s residence on Azza Street in what organisers termed the largest Saturday night protest there since October 7, The Times of Israel report. Release Of Hostages Demanded, Govt Accused Of Abandoning Northern Communities Protesters led by family members of hostages held by Hamas marched down King George Street, demanding an immediate deal and early polls. The protesters accused Netanyahu’s government of abandoning Israel’s embattled northern communities, some 60,000 of whose residents have been displaced for more than eight months due to Hezbollah fire. After the marchers reached their destination outside Netanyahu’s residence, they participated in a joint rally organized by the local branch of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum and the city’s anti-government movement, Safeguarding our Shared Home. In addition, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum held rallies across the country, including addresses by hostages whom Hamas released from captivity in November. It is believed that 116 people held hostage by Hamas on October 7 remain in Gaza, not all of them are alive. (Inputs from ANI)",

He had to sacrifice his life for the Kashmir Satyagraha campaign that he started with thousands of workers of Bharatiya Jana Sangh. The dream of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee is coming true today under the leadership of PM Modi, by abolishing Article 370 in Kashmir...&quot;\",\"headline\":\"ucknow: Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath says \\\\\\\"Today is the \\\\'Balidan Diwad\\\\' of Dr.\",\"datePublished\":\"2024-06-23T10:04:48+05:30\",\"dateModified\":\"2024-06-23T10:04:48+05:30\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.india.com\\/news\\/india\\/breaking-news-live-suraj-revanna-sexual-assault-case-amarnath-yatra-preparations-latest-updates-7033316\\/liveblog-entry-494708\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:\\/\\/www.india.com\\/news\\/india\\/breaking-news-live-suraj-revanna-sexual-assault-case-amarnath-yatra-preparations-latest-updates-7033316\\/\",\"image\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/static.india.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2024\\/06\\/live-blog-breaking-news.jpg\",\"height\":\"400\",\"width\":\"700\",\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"India.com\",\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/static.india.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/11\\/IDC-website-logo.png\",\"width\":\"121\",\"height\":\"60\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Sumaila Zaman\",{\"@type\":\"BlogPosting\",\"articleBody\":\"Gopal Baglay, presently High Commissioner of India to Australia, has been concurrently accredited as the next High Commissioner to the Republic of Nauru, with residence in Canberra: MEA\",\"headline\":\"Gopal Baglay, presently High Commissioner of India to Australia, has been concurrently accredited a\",\"datePublished\":\"2024-06-23T09:39:14+05:30\",\"dateModified\":\"2024-06-23T09:39:14+05:30\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.india.com\\/news\\/india\\/breaking-news-live-suraj-revanna-sexual-assault-case-amarnath-yatra-preparations-latest-updates-7033316\\/liveblog-entry-494707\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:\\/\\/www.india.com\\/news\\/india\\/breaking-news-live-suraj-revanna-sexual-assault-case-amarnath-yatra-preparations-latest-updates-7033316\\/\",\"image\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/static.india.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2024\\/06\\/live-blog-breaking-news.jpg\",\"height\":\"400\",\"width\":\"700\",\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"India.com\",\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/static.india.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/11\\/IDC-website-logo.png\",\"width\":\"121\",\"height\":\"60\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Sumaila Zaman\",{\"@type\":\"BlogPosting\",\"articleBody\":\"Gujarat CM Bhupendra Patel launched a state-wide Polio campaign;

        "text": "Priest Among 8 Dead As Gunmen Attack Synagogues, Churches In Russia’s Dagestan   \n         Moscow:  At least nine people lost their lives and 25 others sustained injuries in coordinated attacks by gunmen in Russia’s Dagestan on Monday (local time). According to the Investigative Directorate of the Investigative Committee of Russia for the Republic of Dagestan, a ‘terror probe’ has been initiated under the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, CNN reported. \nAttacks have been reported in churches, synagogues and a police traffic stop in the cities of Derbent and Makhachkala, which are about 120km (75 miles) apart. \nIn a statement, the investigation directorate said, “All the circumstances of the incident and the persons involved in the terrorist attacks are being established, and their actions will be given a legal assessment.” \nAmong the dead are seven law enforcement officers, a priest and a church security guard, according to local authorities. Five “militants” have also been killed, according to the Russian news agency TASS. \n“According to the information I received, Father Nikolay was killed in the church in Derbent, they slit his throat. He was 66-years-old and very ill,” Dagestan Public Monitoring Commission Chairman Shamil Khadulaev said. \nHe also said a security guard at the church armed with only a pistol was shot. \nOne of the law enforcement officers killed was the head of the “Dagestan Lights” police department, Mavludin Khidirnabiev, according to the Dagestan Ministry of Internal Affairs telegram. \nAt a church in Makhachkala, 19 people locked themselves in for safety during a shootout that ended with at least one attacker being killed, TASS reported citing the Ministry of Internal Affairs for Dagestan. \nMeanwhile, a synagogue in Derbent was set on fire with photos showing large flames and plumes of smoke billowing heavily out of a series of windows on at least one floor of the structure. \nIn what seems to be coordinated attacks that took place around the same time as those in Derbent, a synagogue and a police traffic post in Makhachkala also came under fire. \nIn a recent update, Dagestan’s leader, Sergey Melikov, dispatched a message using the Telegram app. In his announcement, he alluded to attempts by unknown entities to unhinge the region’s tranquillity, successfully thwarted by the Dagestan cops. Further, Melikov mentioned that among the assailants, there were reported casualties. Currently, a process to identify these individuals is ongoing. In the light of these events, an operational hub has been activated and a countering mission, termed as ‘Interception’, is well underway. \nCalling on people to remain calm, Sergey Melikov said, “Panic and fear are what they were counting on in … They won’t get this from Dagestanis!” \nThe Israeli foreign ministry termed it “a combined attack” on the two synagogues. In the statement, the ministry said synagogues in Makhachkala and Derbent were attacked, the report said. \n“The synagogue in Derbent was set on fire and burned to the ground. Local guards were killed. The synagogue in Makhachkala was attacked by gunfire, there are no further details,” the foreign ministry said in a statement. \nThe statement reads, “As far as is known, there were no worshipers in the synagogues at the time of the attack, and there are no known casualties from the Jewish community.”  \n              \n \n \n                               \n         \n         For breaking news and live news updates, like us on  Facebook  or follow us on  Twitter  and  Instagram .

        "text": "Isarel-Hamas War: Ambassador R Ravindra urged adherence to international law and international humanitarian law under all circumstances.   \n         Israel Hamas War Latest Update:  Israel and Palestine, who had been at conflict for the last many decades, have now been at war for the last nearly nine months. The terrorist organisation Hamas fired 5000 rockets on Israel from Gaza on October 7 and ever since, the war hasn’t stopped and the destruction and death toll only continues to rise. Just recently, Israel launched multiple attacks on Rafah and while ‘attacking Hamas compounds’, the forces killed several civilians including women and children. In a latest development, Israel has raided the Hamas compounds in Rafah again, seizing weapons and intelligence documents and also uncovering tunnel shafts. While the attack on Rafah to ‘destroy Hamas compounds’ continues, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has headed to the United States, for ‘critical talks’ on the Gaza War.  \n             Israel Raids Hamas Compounds In Rafah As mentioned earlier, the Israeli military pressed operations in the Rafah area on Sunday, destroying two Hamas compounds in the southern Gaza city and seizing numerous weapons, the Israel Defense Forces said on Sunday. In Rafah’s Tel al-Sultan neighborhood, Israeli forces raided a Hamas compound that served as a training ground for Hamas’s Tel al-Sultan Brigade. Soldiers located the office of the brigade’s commander, Mahmoud Hamdan, along with weapons storage facilities and several tunnel shafts. The IDF is in the process of examining and destroying the tunnel shafts and dismantling the compound. In the area of the compound, soldiers also raided the office of the Commander of Rocket and Missile Fire in Hamas’ Rafah Brigade, Yasser Nett, who has been responsible for multiple rocket attacks into Israel and against Israeli troops in Gaza. Parallel to that, soldiers raiding a second Hamas compound in the Rafah area seized large quantities of weapons and intelligence documents and uncovered more tunnel shafts. This raid on Hamas compounds in Rafah comes after an attack on the destroyed weapons caches inside a Gaza University, residential homes and a rocket launching site inside a humanitarian zone. \n             \n           Israeli Defence Minister Heads To US For ‘Critical Talks’ The Defence Minister of Israel, Yoav Gallant has gone to Washington, United States for ‘critical talks’ with the country, regarding the Israel Hamas War. Recently, Israeli PM Netanyahu has said that he is hopeful that the unfreezing of US arms and ammunition deliveries will be a speedy progress which recently has dropped off sharply. The rising civilian death toll in Gaza had quite an impact on the mind of the US President Joe Biden; however, US officials said that they did not know what the Israeli PM meant, when speaking about the arms issue.

        "text": "Isarel-Hamas War: Ambassador R Ravindra urged adherence to international law and international humanitarian law under all circumstances.   \n         Tel Aviv : Amid intense war with Hamas, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reiterated that the US is withholding weapons deliveries at Sunday’s weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem. About four months ago, “There was a dramatic decrease in the munitions coming to Israel from the US,” Netanyahu said in public remarks at the beginning of the meeting.  \n             “For long weeks, we turned to our American friends and requested that the shipments be expedited. We did this time and again. We did so at the highest levels, and at all levels, and I want to emphasize – we did so behind closed doors. We received all sorts of explanations, but one thing we did not receive; the basic situation did not change. Certain items arrived sporadically but the munitions at large remained behind.” Netanyahu has not specified what weapons were being held up by the US. In May, the Biden administration confirmed delaying a shipment of 500 lb. and 2,000 lb. bombs fearing they would be used in Rafah. Washington claims all other weapons are being delivered. The comments came after Defense Minister Yoav Gallant departed for Washington on Saturday night for discussions with senior US officials about the situations in Gaza, and Lebanon, and Iranian threats. Netanyahu is also scheduled to address a joint session of Congress on July 24. \n             \n           Also at the cabinet meeting, Netanyahu announced the appointments of Maj.-Gen. (Res.) Yiftah Ron-Tal and Vice Adm. (Res.) Eliezer Marom to coordinate the the return of evacuated civilians to their communities in the south and along the Lebanese border respectively. Around 60,000 Israelis living in northern communities were forced to evacuate in October when the Hezbollah terror organization began daily rocket and drone attacks. Leaders of the Iran-backed terror group have said they will continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. Since October 7, the Hezbollah attacks have killed 10 civilians and 14 soldiers. Residents of some Gaza border areas have already begun returning to their homes. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 116 remaining hostages, more than 30 are believed dead. (With Inputs from ANI)",

(PTI Photo)   \n         18th Lok Sabha : AIMIM supremo Asaduddin Owaisi Tuesday triggered a controversy as he mentioned war-torn Palestine after taking oath as a Lok Sabha MP in the Upper House of the Parliament. “Jai Bhim, Jai Meem, Jai Telangana, Jai Palestine,” the Hyderabad MP said after his oath taking.  \n             Owaisi, who has been elected from the Hyderabad seat for his fifth term, took oath in Urdu and also recited a prayer before taking oath. After taking his oath, Owaisi hailed his home state Telangana and Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar. He also chanted ‘Jai Meem’– a popular slogan raised by some political parties who claim both Muslims and Dalits in the country have been marginalised.

Radha Mohan Singh, who was in the Chair at the time, assured the members that anything apart from the oath will not go on record. Soon, Pro-tem Speaker Bhartruhari Mahtab returned to the Chair and said that only oath or affirmation is being recorded. “I have said earlier please avoid invoking anything other than oath or affirmation. That is only to be recorded… That should be adhered to,” Mahtab said. Talking reporters outside Parliament, Owaisi defended mentioning the conflict-hit west Asian nation, asserting “they (Palestinians) are oppressed people”. “Other members are also saying different things… I said ‘Jai Bheem, Jai Meem, Jai Telangana, Jai Palestine’. How is it wrong? Tell me the provision of Constitution?,” he asked. “You should also listen to what others said. I said what I had to. Read what Mahatma Gandhi had said about Palestine.” Meanwhile, Union Minister G Kishan Reddy attacked Owaisi over the matter, Union Minister G Kishan Reddy claimed the ‘Jai Palestine’ slogan was “absolutely wrong” and goes against the Indian Constitution.

        "text": "Israel said the offensive in Rafah is expected to be completed within weeks.   \n         Tel Aviv : Amid war with Hamas, Israeli National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi said on Tuesday that Jerusalem will soon roll out a plan to replace Hamas governance in northern Gaza,  Speaking at Reichman University’s annual Herzliya Conference, Hanegbi said that the collapse of Hamas’s military ability to rule will open opportunities “for countries that want to see a governing alternative to Hamas in Gaza, with local leadership in Gaza, to join this process.”  \n             He explained that Gaza’s new leadership will include Israel’s Abraham Accords partners, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations, while the Israeli military continues “cleansing the area” of Hamas’s presence. “We’ve been talking about this notion of ‘the day after’ for many months and the main thing that we’ve tried to emphasize throughout is that it’s mainly the day after Hamas in the sense that we don’t need to wait for it to disappear, because that process could take a long time.” “The idea is, and this is what the Americans agree on, including in the conversations this week and also in the conversation that the minister of defense [Yoav Gallant] is conducting right now [in Washington], is that there will be a so-called top-down leadership, and not only bottom-up,” he continued. \n             \n           Said Hanegbi, “You cannot completely get Hamas to disappear because it’s an idea, a concept.” The US has pressed Israeli officials to clarify a vision for Gaza’s governance after the war. The Biden administration opposes Israel occupying Gaza or allowing the Strip to descend into chaos. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stressed that Israel’s three war aims are the destruction of Hamas’s military and governing capabilities, the return of all hostages, and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel. In an interview with the US-based Punchbowl News on Friday, Netanyahu said a demilitarized post-war Gaza will be overseen by a civilian-run administration with the assistance of Arab countries. He also referred to a “deradicalization process.” At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 116 remaining hostages, more than 30 are believed dead. (With Inputs From ANI)",

        "text": "Hamas Chief Killing: Indian Embassy Issues Advisory For Its Citizens In Lebanon To Limit Movements    \n         New Delhi : Amid rising security concerns and escalating tensions in Lebanon, both India and the United States issued travel advisories for their respective nationals and urged them to exercise caution and reconsider travel plans to the Middle Eastern nation.  \n             Apart from India and US, Russia’s embassy in Beirut also called on its citizens to refrain from traveling to Lebanon until the situation settles down in the southern part of the country. In the advisory, the Indian Embassy in Lebanon advised all Indian nationals to remain vigilant and maintain communication with the Embassy through designated channels. In a statement, the embassy emphasised, “In view of the current situation in Lebanon, all Indian nationals in Lebanon are advised to exercise caution and remain in contact with Embassy of India in Beirut through our Email address: cons.beirut@mea.gov.in or through emergency helpline number +961-76860128.” Similarly, the US Embassy in Lebanon highlighted the unpredictable security environment, warning US citizens to strongly reconsider any plans to visit Lebanon. \n             \n           “The security environment remains complex and can change quickly,” the embassy stated. It specifically cautioned against travel to certain regions, including southern Lebanon, the Lebanon-Syria border area, and refugee settlements. Both embassies underscored the importance of staying informed about local developments and maintaining awareness of one’s surroundings. Tensions between Israel and Lebanon have risen sharply since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel and the ensuing military campaign by Israel in Gaza. Lebanon’s Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah has been firing missiles, mortars and drones into Israel, and Israel has returned that fire, CNN reported. Tens of thousands of people on both sides of the mountainous border have fled as concerns intensify about the possible outbreak of another full-fledged war. (With Inputs From ANI)",

        "description": "US President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will lock horns in the first presidential debate today.",
        "text": "Trump, Biden to face off in first presidential debate today: All you need to know   \n         Washington : US President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will lock horns in the first presidential debate today, marking the countdown for the ultimate showdown later this year. The CNN debate in Atlanta will start at 9 PM on Thursday (local time). In India, it is scheduled to air at 6:30 AM on Friday (Indian Standard Time).  \n             This is the earliest debate ever in a presidential race. It is happening before the Republican and Democratic conventions in July and August, when both Trump and Biden will officially accept their party nominations. The showdown is scheduled to go 90 minutes with two commercial breaks. There will be no live studio audience: a major change from previous debates. Polling shows over 70 per cent of American voters plan to tune in to the high-stake debate. Biden Vs Trump: First presidential debate today In April 2023, President Joe Biden launched his re-election campaign wherein he described the contest between him and Trump as a “stark choice” for voters between the continuation of democracy in America and its possible “destruction” under Trump. Biden is set to be the oldest president to ever hold the office. He would be 86 at the end of a second term. Polls indicate that voters are more worried about Biden’s age compared to his opponent’s. However, if Trump wins, he would surpass Biden’s record as the oldest president before the end of his term. \n \n Trump vs Biden 2.0: Presidential Election Debate 2024 \n In November 2022, Trump launched his bid to reclaim the White House. He aims to reclaim the White House after his bitter exit in 2020, as he looks forward to becoming only the second commander-in-chief to win two non-consecutive terms in office. \n             \n            \n \n Trump continues to refuse to accept the results of the 2020 election. Additionally, he is currently facing criminal charges in four cases, two of which involve allegations of election interference and undermining the results of the 2020 election.  \n Earlier in May, Trump was found guilty of all charges at his New York hush money criminal trial. The debate comes at a time when many Americans are seeking relief from high prices and America’s foreign policy faces new challenges amid two ongoing conflicts in Europe and the Middle East.  \n Additionally, some deeply divisive issues like immigration, gun laws and abortion also have stark positions from both leaders. The debate in that sense personifies an election race that has left millions of Americans unsatisfied with the choice offered by two elderly candidates who alienate more voters than they attract, as per CNN. This will mark the third debate between the two men — after the two in the run-up to 2020 polls — but is likely to be more important than the first two because a larger share of the electorate is potentially up for grabs.  \n Biden has pitched his second term as a continuation of his first term with the phrase, “Let’s finish this job”. \nHe has vowed to defend rights such as abortion protections that some Republicans have threatened to erode. If re-elected, Biden has said he would also protect America’s image on the world stage, preserve democracy at home and deliver on climate benchmarks. Trump, on the other hand, has said he would overhaul key factions of the federal government and slash social safety net programs. He has also vowed retribution against his political opponents and has said he would appoint a special prosecutor to “go after” Biden and his family, ANI reported.  \n Trump is advocating strongly for border security, particularly along the southern border with Mexico. In a controversial statement, Trump said that the flow of migrants is “poisoning” the US blood. Additionally, he has pledged to reintroduce his travel ban targeting specific Muslim-majority countries. He has also claimed that he will end the Russia-Ukraine conflict in “one day.” Trump is also considered a strong supporter of Israel.  \n CNN Poll of Polls has found a tight race with no clear leader heading into the presidential debate. Nationwide, the current average stands at 49 per cent support for former President Donald Trump to 47 per cent supporting President Joe Biden. As per Politico, to win over real voters, both Biden and Trump have clear tasks: Biden needs to convince his haters he has a pulse. Trump must also be coherent and try to win back some of the moderates who defected from him to Nikki Haley in the late stages of the GOP primary.",

        "text": "40 Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza: Health authorities(Photo Credit: @UNRWA)   \n         Gaza : At least 40 Palestinians were killed and 224 others injured in Israeli attacks across the besieged Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, as per the health authorities controlled by Hamas. The latest casualties bring the total Palestinian death toll to 37,834, with 86,858 injuries reported since the outbreak of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in October 2023, the health authorities said on Saturday.  \n             Officials added that rescue teams faced significant obstacles in reaching areas targeted by attacks due to fuel shortages and intense clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed factions, particularly in the city of Rafah in southern Gaza and the Shujaeya neighbourhood in eastern Gaza City, Xinhua news agency reported. Avichay Adraee, an Israeli military spokesperson, stated in a press release on Saturday that Israeli forces are actively targeting “terrorist” sites in the Shujaeya area, engaging in operations both above and below ground. During the past hours, the forces eliminated many “saboteurs” in clashes, and the troops found a weapons depot inside a school complex in the area, he added, news agency IANS reported. In Rafah, the Israeli forces eliminated several “saboteurs” and destroyed many “terrorist” infrastructure, including tunnel openings, according to Adraee. Sharing a post on X, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East wrote, “Trash is piling up everywhere, people are living under plastic sheeting where temperatures soar. @UNWateridge Families in #Gaza live next to mountains of garbage and sewage. With very few bathrooms available and unbearable summer heat, the sanitary conditions are desperate.” \n             \n           Earlier on Friday, the Pentagon announced that adverse weather conditions have led to the removal of a temporary floating aid pier operated by the US off the coast of Gaza. This marks the third interruption since mid-May in efforts to facilitate humanitarian deliveries. “Temporarily relocating the pier will prevent potential structural damage that could be caused by the heightened sea state,” said Sabrina Singh, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary, during a briefing on Friday, IANS reported. Israel has been launching a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on October 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 were taken hostage",

        "title": "UK Elections 2024: Rishi Sunak’s Conservative Party Faces Mounting Challenge As Most Polls Predict Rout For His Party’s 14-Year Rule",
        "description": "Polling suggests that Conservatives are only ahead in one age group: people over age 65.",
        "text": "(ANI)   \n         London:  The Conservative Party, which has been in power in the United Kingdom for around 15 years, faces a mounting task while heading into the general elections under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s leadership, with most polls predicting the return of a Labour government in the country for the first time since 2010.  \n             A record number of candidates – more than 4,000 – are campaigning for the July 4 general election across the country. Polling suggests the vote will result in a Labour majority after more than a decade of Conservative rule under five leaders, including current PM Rishi Sunak and David Cameron, now foreign secretary, Al Jazeera reported. But there is an intensifying atmosphere of division as the hard-right party Reform, led by populist leader Nigel Farage, appears on track to improve on its performance in the 2019 elections, when it was known as the Brexit Party. \n             \n           Economic stagnation, a housing crisis, the cost of living, immigration and foreign policy concerns are among the major issues in the elections. The past 15 years have seen the worst income growth in the UK for generations, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). “It has been slow growth for essentially everyone – rich and poor, old and young. This means that even while income inequality has been stable, progress on reducing absolute poverty has been painfully slow,” Tom Waters, an associate director of the IFS, said in late May. In recent years, Britons have also been battling a cost-of-living crisis as prices surge and salaries stagnate. The Conservative and Labour parties have set out differing routes to fix the economy. Labour leader Keir Starmer has announced plans to reform the National Health Service, home-building system, energy sector and other key industries. His party has also promised 7.4 billion pounds (USD 9.4 billion) in tax rises to invest in these sectors. For the Conservatives, a promise of 17 billion pounds (USD 21.6 billion) per year of tax cuts has been made, including 2 percentage points off the main rate of National Insurance contributions, a mandatory tax on salaries. Meanwhile, rising property prices, rent hikes and a lack of affordable new builds are the reasons behind a years-long housing crisis. According to the Local Government Association, the number of temporary accommodations due to the shortage of social housing rose by 89 percent in the 10 years until March 2023. The growing pressure on local councils to support the public intensified through austerity measures intended to reduce the government’s budget deficit that were implemented when a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition came to power in 2010. Mia Gray, an economic geography professor at the University of Cambridge, told Al Jazeera that Britain is in the grip of “an affordable housing crisis”. To remedy the situation, the Conservatives have pledged to build 1.6 million new homes if they win the general election. On the other hand, Labour officials have said they will restore local house-building targets, which were scrapped in 2023, with an aim to construct 1.5 million new homes in the coming years. Health is another crucial issue going into the elections. According to YouGov’s “most important issues” tracker for Britons ahead of the vote, the issue is second only to the cost of living, with 34 per cent of respondents listing it. The official number of people on waiting lists for treatment on the National Health Service (NHS) stood at 7.6 million in April this year – only slightly down from last September’s record high of 7.8 million. Meanwhile, the proportion of people waiting more than four hours to see a doctor at Accident & Emergency departments of hospitals in the UK – a key indicator used to measure the NHS – has risen steadily over the 14 years that the ruling Conservative Party has been in power. While it stood at about 6 per cent at the start of 2011, it passed 50 per cent in December 2022 and has only come back down to about 42 per cent now. In their manifesto for the general election, the Conservatives have promised to increase the budget for the NHS but, for many, it is too little, too late. The issue of immigrants will also play a crucial role in the poll campaign. Al Jazeera cited a recent YouGov poll carried out for Sky News, which suggested that 43 per cent of Britons believe immigration has a negative impact on society, compared with 35 per cent who said the effect of immigration is positive. The Conservatives have repeatedly pledged to crack down on the number of people arriving through ‘irregular’ means, such as those who cross the English Channel from France on small boats, Al Jazeera reported. On Wednesday, the party was dealt a blow as official figures showed 882 people arrived in this way, the highest daily toll since late 2022. Sunak’s government has backed a highly controversial plan, the ‘Rwanda Plan’, to deport undocumented people to Rwanda to have their asylum claims processed there. But the deal has been blocked several times by courts that ruled the plan “unlawful”. In the two years since it was announced, no flights have taken off to Rwanda. Sunak says the first flight will leave on July 24 at the earliest, assuming he wins the election. On the other hand, the Labour Party has said that if it wins, the Rwanda plan will be scrapped. But, at the same time, it has promised to cut down net migration figures without elaborating on how it will do so. Right-wing candidate Farage has called for further tough policies around immigration, which he blames for many societal woes. “Immigration is the real reason for the housing crisis!” Farage posted on X on Thursday. Immigration as a campaign issue cannot be detached from Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. Ever since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in February 2022, the UK pledged unwavering support to Ukraine with Sunak referring to the bond between the West and Kyiv as an “unbreakable alliance”. Even during the recent Group of Seven (G7) summit in Italy, Sunak told his counterparts that the UK was behind Ukraine “whatever it takes”. So far, the UK has pledged 12.5 billion pounds (USD 15.9 billion) in support, including 7.6 billion pounds (USD 9.6 billion) in military assistance. Britain is one of the leading donors to Ukraine, alongside the United States and Germany. Labour has maintained that its support for Ukraine is “ironclad”. The party said it would work with Kyiv’s government to “isolate Russia diplomatically and boost Ukraine’s industrial production”. “We will also work to create a clear path to NATO membership for Ukraine,” the party said in its manifesto. Similarly, the Israel-Hamas war can also play a role among the electorate, In May, a YouGov poll commissioned by Medical Aid for Palestinians and the Council for Arab-British Understanding found that more than 70 per cent of British people want an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Among those who want a ceasefire, 67 per cent are Conservative voters and 86 per cent are Labour voters, according to the poll. However, neither party has vociferously called for an immediate ceasefire. The New York Times, in a recent report, cited polls suggesting that Conservatives could secure their lowest share of seats in Parliament in perhaps a century, as after a turbulent five years of government, their base has ‘fractured.’ Some voters are going left, with the party polling around 20 percentage points behind Labour. Others are heeding the lure of the hard right, with a third of those Britons who voted Conservative last time now saying they will support the anti-immigration Reform party, led by Nigel Farage. Over the last few decades, age has replaced class as the main predictor of political support in Britain, with Conservatives winning more older voters. In the last election, the age at which someone was more likely to vote Conservative than Labour was roughly 40 or older. Now, polling suggests that Conservatives are only ahead in one age group: people over age 65. Notably, the Conservatives benefitted with the promise to finalise Brexit in the 2020 elections. However, now the concerns of public are more centered towards issues like economy and health care, followed by immigration. The voters think Labour is better prepared to handle all three, according to polling from YouGov. Many voters say they feel the Conservative party has left Britain in “a worse state than before it came to power,” as per NYT. It was PM Rishi Sunak’s predecessor, Liz Truss, who set off an economic crisis after she announced plans for tax cuts, deregulation and borrowing. But, now the Conservatives, having been in power for around 15 years under five Prime Ministers, are staring at a mounting challenge, with over half the people who voted for the Conservatives in the last election telling pollsters that they now plan to vote for a different party.",

        "description": "Amid the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine, the United States has evacuated 17 out of 20 American doctors from the war-torn Gaza Strip while three are still stuck there. The US Embassy played an important role in the doctors' evacuation.",
        "text": "US Doctors Evacuated From Gaza (Representative Image)   \n         New Delhi:  Israel and Palestine have been at war for almost eight months now and the destruction and loss of life being caused by this war is heart breaking. It all started when 5000 rockets were fired on Israel from Gaza, by the terrorist organisation Hamas on October 7, 2023. Since then, the  Israel Palestine Conflict  turned into a full-fledged Israel Hamas War – thousands have lost their lives, so many are still held hostage and a lot of people from other countries have also been facing the effects of war they have nothing to do with. A lot of people are stuck in the war-torn area because the Israel borders were shut and these people also include doctors from the United States, who were stuck in Gaza, after the Israel borders were closed. In a latest development, 17 of these American doctors have been evacuated with the help of the US Embassy.  \n             17 American Doctors Evacuated From War-Torn Gaza As mentioned earlier, seventeen of the 20 American doctors who were stuck in Gaza after Israel shut the border crossing from Rafah to Egypt have safely departed the enclave, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Friday. “They’re out. There was 20 American doctors, 17 are out now, came out today. And all 17, they wanted to, they wanted to leave — I won’t speak for the other three, but just, I can assure you that any of them that wanted to leave are out now,” Kirby said. US Embassy Plays Crucial Role In Evacuation The Americans who made their way out did so with the support of the US Embassy in Jerusalem, said a State Department spokesperson. “We have been in close contact with the groups that these US doctors are part of, and we have been in contact with the families of these US citizens,” the spokesperson added. The Embassy team travelled to Kerem Shalom crossing to receive the doctors at the border, the source added, without providing details about how the doctors travelled to the border crossing. 3 American Doctors Still In Gaza CNN reported, citing that the three American doctors who opted not to depart Gaza did so understanding that the US Embassy may not be able to facilitate their departure in the same manner, the source familiar said. They added that it “was an extremely unique operation.” CNN reported that the aid organizations will face challenges getting doctors back into Gaza following the departure of 17 of the 20 American doctors who were stuck there after Israel shut the border crossing from Rafah to Egypt. \n             \n           One of the doctors who decided to stay behind is Dr. Adam Hamawy, who helped save Sen. Tammy Duckworth’s life 20 years ago in Iraq, according to a source familiar with the matter. Hamawy travelled to Gaza with the Palestinian American Medical Association and did not feel right leaving without other doctors coming in to take over, CNN reported citing source. Many members of Congress, including Duckworth, are working with the Biden administration to push Israel to do more to get aid and humanitarian workers into Gaza, and to get the protections needed for those workers. Earlier this week, a top USAID official said that Israel was not doing enough to ensure the safety of aid works. “The deconfliction measures are not where they need to be yet, given the complexity of the environment. So those conversations are ongoing, they need to continue and they need to get to a place where humanitarian aid workers feel safe and secure and able to operate safely. And I don’t think we’re there yet,” said Sonali Korde, assistant to the administrator of USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, noting that Gaza is a “very dangerous place to work.” (Inputs from ANI)",

        "text": "All Israeli Crossings With Gaza Must Be Opened For Humanitarian Aid: Egyptian FM   \n         Cairo:  Amid the ongoing war between Israel Defence Forces and Hamas militants, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry on Friday stated that all land crossings between Israel and the Gaza Strip must be opened for full and unhindered access of humanitarian and relief aid into the strip.  \n             Shoukry made the remarks during a telephonic conversation with Sigrid Kaag, the United Nations Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry’s statement said. During the call, both the sides discussed the humanitarian fallout of the Israeli military operations in Rafah. Meanwhile, Israeli War Cabinet member Benny Gantz has threatened to resign from the government if it doesn’t adopt a new plan for the war in Gaza within three weeks, CNN reported on Saturday. This move would leave Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu more reliant on his far-right allies. \n             \n           Former Israeli defense minister Gantz is demanding that the cabinet lays out a plan for the war against Hamas by June 8. Gantz warned that if his demands are not met, he will withdraw from the government. He said the plan should eliminate Hamas, bring back the hostages, establish an alternative government in the strip, bring back Israeli residents to the north of Israel, and set up a plan to make progress on normalization with Saudi Arabia, CNN reported. Gantz said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must choose between “victory and disaster” as he issued the ultimatum. “If (Netanyahu) choose(s) to lead the nation into the abyss, we will withdraw from the government, turn to the people, and form a government that can bring about a real victory,” Gantz said, CNN reported. Gantz’s ultimatum comes days after current Defense Minister Yoav Gallant publicly demanded a post-war plan and warned he would oppose Israeli rule in Gaza — his most direct statement on the topic. Gallant warned of the consequences of a long-term Israeli military presence in Gaza and called out Netanyahu directly. Meanwhile, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office has rejected Benny Gantz’s threat to leave the government, saying the ultimatum he laid out for the war plan against Hamas would harm Israel. “The conditions set by Benny Gantz are washed-up words whose meaning is clear: the end of the war and a defeat for Israel, the abandonment of most of the hostages, leaving Hamas intact, and the establishment of a Palestinian state,” the office said in a statement. The office also asked Gantz if he’s determined to eliminate the Hamas battalions, oppose the introduction of the Palestinian Authority into Gaza, and oppose the establishment of a Palestinian state – saying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is committed to all three, CNN reported. “Prime Minister Netanyahu thinks that the emergency government is important for achieving all the goals of the war, including the return of all our hostages, and expects Gantz to clarify his positions to the public on these issues,” according to the statement.",

        "description": "Addressing the guests gathered in the Rose Garden, Joe Biden rejected claims that Israel is carrying out genocide in Gaza, criticized an International Criminal Court request for a warrant against Israeli leaders for war crimes and pledged support for Israel in its war against Hamas.",
        "text": "President Joe Biden. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)   \n         Washington : US President Joe Biden issued a clarification on Israel-Hamas war and said what is happening in Gaza is not genocide and reiterated his support for Israel as he hosted a White House celebration for Jewish American Heritage month, The Hill reported.  \n             Addressing the guests gathered in the Rose Garden, Joe Biden rejected claims that Israel is carrying out genocide in Gaza, criticized an International Criminal Court request for a warrant against Israeli leaders for war crimes and pledged support for Israel in its war against Hamas. “I know today’s reception falls on hard times. The trauma of October 7 and its aftermath … is still fresh and ongoing for many of you,” Biden said, referencing the Hamas attacks last year that killed more than 1,000 Israelis. “Let me be clear, contrary to allegations against Israel made by the International Court of Justice, what’s happening is not genocide. We reject that,” he added. “And we’ll always stand with Israel in the threats against its security.” \n             \n           Other Biden officials have in recent weeks similarly rejected the suggestion that Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and left scores without access to adequate food, water and medicine, is genocide, The Hill reported. Among the guests at Monday’s reception were Attorney General Merrick Garland, Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.), Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) and Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.). Biden also recognized the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an Israeli American who is being held hostage by Hamas. Biden said his administration was working to negotiate the release of the remaining hostages who were taken October 7, “and we’re going to get them home.” The Hill reported that the President has tried to walk a careful line with his approach to Israel in recent weeks, defending its right to respond to Hamas and repeatedly condemning antisemitism in the wake of the attack. But, at the same time, he is also calling for Israel to allow more aid into Gaza and urging the country to do more to protect civilians. On Monday, Biden was steadfast in his support of Israel.”We stand with Israel to take out Sinwar and the rest of the butchers of Hamas,” Biden said, referring to Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. “We want Hamas defeated. We’ve worked with Israel to make that happen.” The president also condemned instances of antisemitism on college campuses and elsewhere, which have sharply risen in the months since the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel. “In America, we respect and protect fundamental rights of free speech to protest peacefully. That’s America,” Biden said. “But there’s no place on any campus in America, any place in America, for antisemitism or hate speech of any kind against Jews or anyone else.”",

The media organisation has condemned this move and has also accused the government of abusing the recently passed foreign media law.  \n             Israel Reverses Decision Of Broadcasting Equipment Seizure The Israeli government will return a camera and broadcasting equipment it had seized from The Associated Press on Tuesday, reversing course hours after it blocked the news organization’s live video of Gaza and faced mounting criticism for interfering with independent journalism. After Israel seized the AP equipment, the Biden administration, journalism organizations and an Israeli opposition leader condemned the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and pressured it to reverse the decision. Israel’s communications minister, Shlomo Karhi, said late Tuesday on the social platform X: “I have now ordered to cancel the action and return the equipment to the AP.” AP Broadcasting Equipment Seized By Israel, Live Transmission Stopped As mentioned earlier, following its crackdown on Qatar-based media outlet Al Jazeera, the Israeli government had seized the broadcasting equipment of The Associated Press (AP) in southern Israel, accusing the news agency of violating a new media law by providing images to Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based media giant reported on Tuesday. Al Jazeera said it was among thousands of clients to receive live video feeds from the AP and other news organisations. The seizure followed a verbal order Thursday to cease the live transmission, which the news organisation refused to do, according to Al Jazeera. “In accordance with the government decision and the instruction of the communications minister, the communications ministry will continue to take whatever enforcement action is required to limit broadcasts that harm the security of the state,” the Israel ministry said in a statement. \n             \n           Associated Press Accused Govt Of Abusing New Foreign Broadcaster Law The AP denounced the move, accusing the government of abusing the recently passed foreign media law. “The Associated Press decries in the strongest terms the actions of the Israeli government to shut down our longstanding live feed showing a view into Gaza and seize AP equipment,” Lauren Easton, vice president of corporate communications at the AP, was quoted as saying by Al Jazeera. “The shutdown was not based on the content of the feed but rather an abusive use by the Israeli government of the country’s new foreign broadcaster law. We urge the Israeli authorities to return our equipment and enable us to reinstate our live feed immediately so we can continue to provide this important visual journalism to thousands of media outlets around the world,” she added. AP Broadcast Equipment Seized: Here’s What Happened According to Al Jazeera, officials from the Communications Ministry arrived at the AP location in the southern town of Sderot on Tuesday afternoon and seized the equipment. They handed the AP a piece of paper, signed by Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi, alleging it was violating the country’s foreign broadcaster law. Shortly before the equipment was seized, the AP was broadcasting a general view of famine-struck northern Gaza where Israeli forces continue to press on a ground and aerial assault. The AP said it complies with Israel’s military censorship rules, which prohibit broadcast of details like troops movements that could endanger soldiers. The live shot showed smoke rising over the besieged territory, the Al Jazeera reported. (Inputs from AP, ANI)",

        "description": "Israel National Day commemorates the declaration of the establishment of the sovereign state of Israel on May 14, 1948.",
        "text": "Israel President Isaac Herzog on Tuesday commended Prime Minister Narendra Modi for pledging support and solidarity with Israel in the aftermath of the horrific Hamas terror attacks on his homeland on October 7, last year, saying the latter “continued to stand on the right side of history”. “Although India is one of the largest countries in the world and Israel one of the smallest, there is so much that we share together. We are both thoroughly modern nations founded on firm democratic ideals, but we are also deeply rooted in tradition.  \n             Across so many spheres and sectors, our partnerships thrive from robust trade and commercial ties to meaningful cultural, academic, technological and scientific exchanges,” the President said in a video message during Israel’s National Day, or Independence Day celebrations held at the Israeli embassy in New Delhi. “Of course, the ties we share take on added meaning in times of crisis. Prime Minister Modi was one of the first world leaders to condemn the October 7 massacre. He has continued to stand on the right side of history,” he added. Highlighting the growing importance of India’s role in global leadership, President Harzog said that New Delhi has continued to speak loudly and clearly for Israel, for the “value of humanity and civilisation”, and in the hope of a further strengthening of the bilateral ties between the two countries. \n             \n           “As your democracy and economy grow, your role in global leadership grows and expands in turn, a fact that we in Israel applaud and welcome as an emerging leader. India continues to speak out loudly and clearly for Israel, for the values of humanity and civilisation, and for the immediate return of all our hostages,” the President said.”I am certain that we will see India-Israel ties expressed in a growing range of bilateral and multilateral context,” he added. Israel National Day commemorates the declaration of the establishment of the sovereign state of Israel on May 14, 1948. According to the Hebrew calendar, it falls on the 5th of Iyar. The State of Israel gained independence from British rule in Palestine on May 14, when Jewish Agency Chairman David Ben-Gurion proclaimed the Jewish state. This event is celebrated annually as Israel’s Independence Day.Significantly, Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra joined the celebrations as the chief guest, along with the Israel ambassador to India, Naor Gilon and other dignitaries. Speaking at the event, Foreign Secretary Kwatra brought up the Hamas terror attacks, saying that India, itself, is a victim of cross-border terrorism and has a zero-tolerance approach to terrorism in all its forms.”We join the people of Israel to celebrate a momentous occasion, the 76th anniversary of Israel’s independence. It is deeply inspiring that the extraordinary journey of a nation that has not only survived and thrived against all odds, but also transformed itself into a flourishing landscape of innovation, advancement and growth,” he said. “The terror attacks on October 7 has left us all shaken. As you all know, India itself is a victim of cross-border terrorism and has a zero-tolerance approach to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. There can be no justifications for acts of terror whatever our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the hostages and innocent lives lost in these heinous acts,” he added. Secretary Kwatra also underscored how communal harmony prevails in the country, with people of diverse religions living in one place, including Jewish people, while reaffirming India’s bilateral ties with Israel. “I proudly say that throughout our history, India has been a safe haven and a land of tolerance for people of diverse faiths, including the jewish community. Jewish communities that have made India a home, enriching our nation with traditions, customs and contributions. India and Israel share a deep bond rooted in historical, cultural and strategic ties,” he said. “Over the years, our partnership has grown exponentially and is marked by mutual respect, understanding and collaboration across various sectors from agriculture to technology defence to water management, India and Israel have worked together to achieve remarkable feats of progress and innovation,” he added. The Israeli ambassador to India, Gilon, also spoke highly of the support from India following the October 7 attacks, saying that they will never forget the sympathy they received from India. “From October 7, both the government and the people of India stood on the side of Israel. And this we will never forget. The amount of support we go there is nothing short of amazing. This is, I think, a reflection of India itself being a victim of terror for many years, but more so, I think it’s an indication of the very special relations between India and Israel, or more precisely, between the Indian people and the Jewish people,” the envoy said. “Our relations of the civilizations are ancient, but in the modern world, our relations are relatively young. We made a huge advancement in very short time, and I would attribute it to what I called the secret ingredient, and this is the very emotional attachment relations between the two peoples,” he added.",

        "text": "(Representational image: unsplash.com)   \n         Palestine State:  The leaders of  Norway, Ireland , and  Spain  have said their countries will formally recognize  Palestine  as a state for the sake of “peace in the Middle East”. Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre on Wednesday said that a two-state solution was in  Israel ‘s “best interest” adding that the recognition would come as of May 28.  \n             Both  Hamas  and its rival, the  Palestinian Authority  (PA), have welcomed the recognition while Israel reacted angrily, warning the move would mean more instability in the region. Israel also recalled its ambassadors to Norway, Ireland, And Spain. Norway, Ireland, and Spain said Wednesday they were recognizing a Palestinian state, a move welcomed by Palestinians as an affirmation of their decades-long quest while Israel recalled its ambassadors to the three countries. \n             \n           “We hope that our recognition and our reasons contribute to other western countries to follow this path because the more we are, the more strength we will have to impose a ceasefire, to achieve the release of the hostages held by Hamas, to relaunch the political process that can lead to a peace agreement,” said Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez while addressing the lower house adding that the move was aimed at accelerating efforts to secure a ceasefire in Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza. Several European Union countries designated in the past few weeks that they propose to make the recognition of the Palestinian state as they contended that a two-state solution is essential for lasting peace in the region. Some 140 countries have already recognized a Palestinian state, more than two-thirds of United Nations members barring the major Western countries. Now, this could put more pressure on the continental superpowers France and Germany to reconsider their position.

        "text": "President Joe Biden. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)   \n         Washington : Hours after Norway, Ireland, and Spain announced plans to recognise the Palestinian state, US President Joe Biden believes the two-state solution should be brought about through direct negotiations and not a ‘unilateral recognition’, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Wednesday.  \n             On talking about whether the US is concerned with other nations recognising a Palestinian state, Sullivan, at a press briefing, said, “Each country is entitled to make its own determinations, but the US position on this is clear President Biden as I just said has been on the record supporting a two-state solution.” “He has been equally emphatic on the record that that two-state solution should be brought about through direct negotiations through the parties, not through unilateral recognition that’s a principled position that we have held on a consistent basis. We will communicate that to our partners around the world and we’ll see what unfolds,” he added. Sullivan called Israel’s decision to withhold funds from Palestinian authority ‘wrong’, noting that withholding funds destabilises the West Bank and undermines the search for security and prosperity for the people of Palestine. \n             \n           On the US’ reaction to Israel’s response to recognising Palestinian statehood by withholding funds from Palestinian authority, he said, “I think it’s wrong on a strategic basis because withholding funds destabilizes the West Bank. It undermines the search for security and prosperity for the Palestinian people which is in Israel’s interest and it’s wrong to withhold funds that provide basic goods and services to innocent people. So, from our perspective those funds should continue to go um with all of the necessary safeguards but they should continue to flow.” As Spain, Norway, and Ireland announced plans to formally recognise a Palestinian state, Israel reacted to the decision of the three nations in anger and immediately recalled their ambassadors from each country, CNN reported. Irish foreign minister Micheal Martin said the recognition of the Palestinian state will come into force in all three nations on May 28, with the prime ministers of the nations calling the move as an ‘important step’ towards “peace” in the region. The Israeli embassy in Ireland, too, condemned the decision of Spain, Norway and Israel to recognise Palestinian statehood. “We are disappointed by the Irish government’s decision on recognition, which follows worrying initiatives and statements in recent months,” Israel’s Embassy in Dublin said in a statement on Wednesday, according to a CNN report.

The development comes after Norway announced its recognition of such an independent state Wednesday morning and Ireland, as well as Spain, are expected to soon follow.  \n             In making his announcement, Katz said, “I am sending a clear message today – Israel will not be complacent against those who undermine its sovereignty and endanger its security.” “Ireland and Norway intend to send a message to the Palestinians and the whole world today: Terrorism pays,” he added. “After the terrorist organization Hamas carried out the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, after it committed the most horrific sex crimes the world has seen, these countries chose to give a reward to Hamas and Iran and recognize a Palestinian state.” Calling the recognition a “twisted step” and an “injustice to the memory of the 7/10 victims,” Katz said it is also an “injury to the efforts to return the 128 abductees and the abductees – this is a back wind for the jihadists of Hamas and Iran, which distances the chance for peace and undermines Israel’s right to self-defense.” \n             \n           “The Irish-Norwegian stupidity parade does not deter us,” he added, “we are determined to achieve our goals: restoring security to our citizens and the removal of Hamas and the return of the kidnapped.

President Biden and President Al-Sisi affirmed their commitment to work together to set the conditions for a durable and sustainable peace in the Middle East region,” it added. Meanwhile, the United Nations’ top court has ordered Israel to halt its operations in the southern Gaza city of Rafah and withdraw from the enclave, CNN reported. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, Netherlands issued the order on Friday, in the case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of genocide, citing “immense risk” to the Palestinian population. “Israel must immediately halt its military offensive and any other action in the Rafah Governorate which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part,” International Court of Justice (ICJ) Judge Nawaf Salam said. Notably, the decision marks the third time this year, the 15-judge panel has issued preliminary orders seeking to rein in the death from the international community, including the United States, not to proceed. The court stated that the humanitarian situation in Gaza had deteriorated “even further” since the court last ordered provisional measures in March. Salam said, “The humanitarian situation is now to be characterized as disastrous.” The ICJ noted that around 8,00,000 Palestinians had been displaced from Rafah as of May 18, after Israel began its military offensive on May 7. Israel had warned civilians in parts of the city to evacuate ahead of its operation, but the court said these efforts were not “sufficient to alleviate the immense risk to which the Palestinian population is exposed as a result” of Israel’s incursion, as reported by CNN. The court also expressed grave concern over the fate of the hostages abducted by Hamas and other armed groups after it attacked Israel on October 7. Israel launched its assault on the southern city of Rafah this month, forcing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to flee a city that had become a refuge to about half of the population’s 2.3 million people, Al Jazeera reported. \n             \n           Rafah, on Gaza’s southern edge, has also been the main route for aid, and international organizations have stressed that the Israeli operation has cut off the enclave and raised the risk of famine in the region, according to CNN report.",

        "description": "The Palestinian Health Ministry has reported that in the recent Israeli strikes in Rafah amid the ongoing Israel Hamas War, at least 35 innocent people have lost their lives and dozens are injured; most of them being women and children.",
        "text": "Israel Hamas War Latest Update:  It has almost been eight months since Israel and the terrorist organisation Hamas have been at war; the war that has led to mass destruction, loss of thousands of lives and scarring those alive, for the rest of their time on this earth. The  Israel Palestine Conflict  that turned into a full-fledged  Israel Hamas War  after Hamas fired 5000 rockets from the Gaza Strip on Israel on October 7, is still going on and despite interventions from other countries and the UN agencies, the deadly attacks do not seem to end anytime soon. In a latest update, there have been Israeli strikes in Rafah which have resulted in the death of at least 35 people and has injured dozens of others; according to the Health Ministry of Palestine, most of the dead and injured are women and children.  \n             Israeli Strikes In Rafah; 35 Killed, Dozens Injured As mentioned earlier, at least 35 people were killed and dozens more were injured in Israel’s strike in Gaza on Sunday, CNN reported, citing the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. The Palestinian Ministry of Health said that the majority of those killed and injured are women and children. In an earlier statement, the ministry said, “There is no hospital in Rafah with enough capacity to take this number of killed and injured, causing confusion among ambulance teams on where to transfer them.” Camp For Displaced People Hit By Airstrike Gaza officials and the Palestine Red Crescent Society said the area that was hit by the airstrike is a camp for displaced people. Videos posted on social media showed a large fire at the scene, with paramedics and firefighters working to manage the aftermath. The area that had been targeted included a large container used as a shelter for dozens of families, surrounded by hundreds of tents. Gaza’s government office said, “The Israeli occupation army had designated these areas as safe zones, calling on citizens and displaced persons to head to these safe areas,” adding that when displaced people sought refuge, they came under attack, according to a CNN report. Hamas Compound In Rafah Struck Where Significant Hamas Terrorists Were Operating: IDF Earlier, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) confirmed the strike and said that it struck a “Hamas compound in Rafah in which significant Hamas terrorists were operating a short while ago.” The IDF said that it was aware of reports indicating that several civilians were harmed due to the strike and fire that was ignited and added that the incident is under review. \n             \n           In a post on X, IDF stated, “An IDF aircraft struck a Hamas compound in Rafah in which significant Hamas terrorists were operating a short while ago. The strike was carried out against legitimate targets under international law, through the use of precise munitions and on the basis of precise intelligence that indicated Hamas’ use of the area. The IDF is aware of reports indicating that as a result of the strike and fire that was ignited several civilians in the area were harmed. The incident is under review.” (Inputs from ANI)",

        "text": "Representable image   \n         Tel Aviv:  An Israeli airstrike overnight destroyed a pair of rocket launchers in Rafah that were aimed at the Kerem Shalom border crossing, the Israel Defence Forces said on Sunday. In the past week, 2,000 trucks delivering aid entered Gaza, including through the Kerem Shalom crossing, located near the convergence of the Israeli, Gaza and Egyptian borders. Kerem Shalom has taken on new importance since Cairo closed its side of the Rafah border crossing after Israeli forces took control of the Palestinian side of the crossing on May 7. Undelivered food piling up on the Egyptian side has been rotting.  \n             Operation Failed As Hamas Squad Eliminated During targeted operations in the area of Rafah, Hamas terror squads trying to attack Israeli troops were eliminated. Afterwards, ground forces discovered tunnel shafts and large quantities of weapons, including AK-47s, RPGs, grenades, and explosives. In the Jabalya area of northern Gaza, soldiers acting on intelligence seized weapons and rocket parts from a Hamas storage facility embedded inside a school.  Hamas For More Exploitation Of Civilians “This is further evidence of the Hamas terrorist organization’s systematic exploitation of civilian infrastructure for its military activities,” the IDF said. Over the past day, Israeli Air Force strikes destroyed more than 50 terror targets across Gaza, including terror squads, missile launchers, weapons storage facilities and other terror infrastructure. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 125 remaining hostages, 39 are believed dead.",

        "text": "Israeli Strike On Rafah   \n         Israeli Strike On Rafah Kills 45:  The  Israel Hamas War  keeps taking ugly turns every now and then; in a latest update, an Israeli airstrike was conducted on a displacement camp near Rafah city which killed at least 45 Palestinians, who were innocent and not at fault. The people killed in the attack include women and children and apart from the death toll in the  Rafah Strike , 200 others were seriously injured. The Israeli strike on Rafah has got a lot of attention and is also being condemned by various nations across the world; reacting to it, the  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu  has called it Israel’s ‘tragic mistake’ and that they are ‘investigating this case’.  \n             Israeli PM Netanyahu Calls Rafah Strike ‘Tragic Mistake’ As mentioned earlier, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday called the country’s strike on a displacement camp in Rafah a “tragic mistake.” He said that Israel is carrying out investigation into the incident, CNN reported. In his address at the Israeli Knesset on Monday, Netanyahu said, “Despite our best effort, not to harm those not involved, unfortunately a tragic mistake happened last night. We are investigating the case.” Airstrike On Displacement Camp In Rafah, 45 Killed At least 45 people were killed and 200 others were injured after the Israeli strike hit a camp for displaced people, CNN reported, according to the government media office in Gaza. Shortly after the attack, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) announced that two senior Hamas officials had been killed after targeting a Hamas compound. The Israeli attack followed Hamas’ first rocket attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv in months. In a statement, the IDF said the strike had killed Yassin Rabia, who managed the Hamas terrorist activity in Judea and Samari and transferred funds to terrorist targets. According to IDF, Rabia was also behind numerous attacks in which IDF soldiers were killed. Furthermore, Khaled Najjar, another senior member of Hamas, directed shooting attacks and terrorist activities in Judea and Samaria, according to the IDF. \n             \n           Hamas Denies Any Ceasefire Negotiations After Rafah Attack: Report According to latest media reports, Hamas has reportedly informed mediators that it will not participate in any negotiation for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip or a prisoner exchange deal after Israel’s attack on the southernmost Gazan city of Rafah on Sunday night. The decision was made in response to the Israeli army’s “targeting of tents housing displaced civilians in the northwest of Rafah, killing and wounding dozens of them”, Xinhua news agency reported, citing a Hamas source.

        "text": "New York : United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres took strong exception to the Israeli strike in Rafah and said that the attack killed many innocent lives who were seeking shelter from the deadly conflict. He went on to add that the horror must stop as there is no safe place in Gaza.  \n             Taking to X, Guterres stated, “I condemn Israel’s actions which killed scores of innocent civilians who were only seeking shelter from this deadly conflict. There is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop.” In the Israeli strike, at least 45 people were killed and 200 others were injured after the Israeli strike hit a camp for displaced people, CNN reported, according to the government media office in Gaza. Shortly after the attack, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) announced that two senior Hamas officials had been killed after targeting a Hamas compound. The Israeli attack followed Hamas’ first rocket attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv in months. \n             \n           The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, voiced his horror at the further loss of civilian lives in Gaza. He stated that Israel’s strikes on Sunday demonstrates there is literally no safe place. In a news release on Monday, he said, “The images from the camp are horrific and point to no apparent change in the methods and means of warfare used by Israel that have already led to so many civilian deaths.” “Sunday’s strike underscores once again that there is literally no safe place in Gaza,” he added. Turk said, “I note that the IDF has announced a review, but what is shockingly clear is that by striking such an area, densely packed with civilians, this was an entirely predictable outcome. It is crucial that such reviews lead to accountability and changes in policy and practices.” Volker Turk reiterated his call on all parties to the conflict to put in place a ceasefire, according to the statement released by UN. He said, “Israel must take immediate steps to protect civilians, and ensure they have access to essential humanitarian assistance, and release all those detained arbitrarily.” The UN High Commissioner called on Hamas terrorists to unconditionally release all hostages at once. He stated that Hamas must stop the firing of rockets, which are inherently indiscriminate, in clear violation of international humanitarian law.

        "text": "Israeli Strike On Rafah (Reuters)   \n         Israeli Strike On Rafah:  The entire world has been shocked with the recent air strike by Israel on the city of Rafah, that hit a tent camp, killing 45 innocent people including women and children; many were burnt alive and  Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  called this a ‘tragic mistake’. The attack on Rafah comes after International Court of Justice’s warning and that there should be an absolute ceasefire immediately. Now, reacting to the  Israeli Attack on Rafah , The White House has also spoken about how the ‘major ground operation in Rafah’ could actually trigger a change in the US Policy towards Israel.  \n             ‘Major Ground Operation’ Could Trigger Change In US Policy Towards Israel The White House on Tuesday provided the most complete definition yet of what it considers a “major ground operation” in Rafah that could trigger a change in United States policy toward Israel, and said Israel’s actions there have not yet reached that level. “We have not seen them smash into Rafah – we have not seen them go in with large units, large numbers of troops in columns and formations in some sort of coordinated maneuver against multiple targets on the ground. That is a major ground operation. We have not seen that,” White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters at a briefing. \n Israel’s three-week-old Rafah offensive stirred renewed outrage and prompted an outcry from global leaders after an air stike on Sunday that Gaza officials said killed at least 45 people when a blaze ignited in a tent camp in a western district.  \n Biden Administration’s Warning To Israel \n The Biden administration has repeatedly warned Israel against launching a large-scale military offensive in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza packed with refugees who followed Israel’s previous orders to evacuate there. President Joe Biden himself publicly warned Israel this month that the U.S. would stop supplying it with weapons if Israeli forces conduct a major invasion there without a credible plan to protect civilians. \n             \n            \n Israel told around one million Palestinian civilians displaced by the almost eight-month-old war to evacuate to Al-Mawasi when it launched its incursion in Rafah in early May. Around that many have fled Rafah since then, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA reported on Tuesday.  \n Asked about reports that Israeli forces have moved into central Rafah, Kirby said “my understanding is, and I believe the Israelis have spoken to this, that they are moving along something called the Philadelphia corridor, which is on the outskirts of the town, not in the town proper.”  \n “We have not seen a major ground operation and these tanks are moving along a corridor that they have told us previously that they would use on the outskirts of the town to try to put pressure on Hamas,” Kirby said.  \n ICJ Order For Israel To Immediately Halt Military Assault On Rafah \n The World Court last week ordered Israel to immediately halt its military assault on Rafah, in a landmark emergency ruling in South Africa’s case accusing Israel of genocide. Israel said it had targeted two senior Hamas operatives in a compound and had not intended to cause civilian casualties. “I don’t know how anybody could dispute that they were trying to go after Hamas in a targeted precise way,” Kirby said, adding that the U.S. would wait for the results of Israel’s investigation into the incident.  \n The U.S. is by far the biggest supplier of weapons to Israel, and it accelerated deliveries after the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks. Rafah was a major entry point for humanitarian relief before Israel stepped up its military offensive on the Gaza side of the border earlier this month and seized control of the crossing from the Palestinian side.  \n More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s offensive, Gaza’s health ministry says. Israel launched its air and ground war after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.  \n (Inputs from Reuters)",

        "text": "Tel Aviv : Amid ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, the Israel’s top military officer has appointed an advisory committee to examine the conditions of imprisoned Hamas terrorists captured since October 7, the Israel Defence Forces announced on Tuesday.  \n             Notably, IDF Chief of Staff Lt-Gen Herzi Halevi’s appointment of the committee comes on the heels of a CNN report in mid-May alleging that Israelis at three detention facilities tortured and mistreated Hamas terrorists detained in Gaza. Terror suspects captured in Gaza are initially sent to detention facilities at the IDF’s Sde Teiman, Anatot, and Ofer bases, before being transferred to the Israel Prison Service. “However, due to the unprecedented number of detainees and the overcrowding in facilities of the Israel Prison Service, many of those apprehended have been held in IDF detention facilities for extended periods of time, beyond what was expected. Meanwhile, allegations have been raised regarding the conditions in these facilities,” the IDF said. \n             \n           Approximately 2,300 Palestinian terror suspects have been detained in Gaza since Israel launched its ground invasion on October 27. The five-person committee will examine the conditions in the detention facilities, assess whether they are in line with international law, and submit recommendations within three weeks. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 125 remaining hostages, 39 are believed dead. (With inputs from ANI)",

        "description": "Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry claims the fire killed 45 Palestinians, a number that has not been independently verified.",
        "text": "Israeli Strike On Rafah (Reuters)   \n         Tel Aviv : A fire at a displaced persons camp in Rafah following an airstrike was likely caused by Hamas munitions, according to a preliminary military investigation, the Israel Defense Forces said on Tuesday. The Sunday night airstrike killed Hamas commanders Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar in a compound in the Rafah neighborhood of Tel Sultan. The pair were responsible for coordinating and funding terror attacks in Judea and Samaria.  \n             According to the IDF, the area of the compound had been used for Hamas activities. Just 47 meters away from the site of the strike was a rocket launcher and launching pit. The compound was one kilometer away from the humanitarian zone and the IDF said it used two small munitions to prevent collateral damage in the nearby camp. The IDF stressed that the 17-kilogram warheads used were not powerful enough on their own to trigger the fire. The military believes the fire was likely caused by secondary explosions from Hamas munitions or some other material it was not aware of. “We have a suspicion, following intelligence surveillance and analysis of the videos from the event that were distributed on social networks, that secondary explosions at the site were caused by Hamas ammunition storage. This suspicion is under investigation,” the IDF said. \n             \n           The IDF also released a recording of two Rafah residents specifically saying the fire was caused by Hamas explosives. “They say that they [the Hamas commanders killed] sat in a meeting, and that there is [a facility] and in addition, there was ammunition that began to explode. Bags of money scattered in the air,” one Palestinian said. Asked if the exploding ammunition “is really ours,” the first Palestinian replied, “Yes, it is an ammunition depot. The bombardment by the Jews was not strong. It was a small missile, because it did not create a large hole. And then explosions began.” Gaza’s Hamas-run Health Ministry claims the fire killed 45 Palestinians, a number that has not been independently verified. Meanwhile, the UN Security Council is due to hold a closed-door emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the situation in Rafah. The attack also came against the backdrop of a ruling by the International Court of Justice on Friday whose ambiguous wording is unlikely to curtail military activity in Rafah. Rafah sits on the Gaza-Egypt border and is Hamas’s last stronghold with an estimated four battalions. Israel’s delegation of the ICJ told the judges that of the 700 tunnels located in Rafah by the army, approximately 50 crossed into Egypt. Those tunnels are used for weapons smuggling and could also be used to take hostages out of the Strip. Israel took control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing on May 7 to prevent Hamas from commandeering humanitarian aid deliveries from Egypt. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 125 remaining hostages, 39 are believed dead.",

        "text": "Israel Takes Full 'Operational Control' Of Gaza-Egypt Border, Uncovering 20 Tunnels Leading Into Sinai Peninsula   \n         The Israel Defence Forces have announced their complete “operational control” over the Gaza-Egypt border, uncovering 20 tunnels leading into the Egyptian Sinai. The Philadelphi corridor, a 14 km stretch along the border, was established in 2006 post Israel’s disengagement from the Strip to curb weapons smuggling. However, in 2007, Hamas seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority.  \n             The IDF has deployed troops across most of the corridor, with surveillance and firepower managing a section near the Mediterranean coast. The army has identified cross-border tunnels and 82 shafts within the area that will be demolished. Additionally, Hamas has strategically positioned numerous rocket launchers along the border, a politically sensitive zone. The Gaza-Egypt border is considered a demilitarized region as per the Camp David Accords of 1978. Israel recently assumed control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. Tragically, Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7 resulted in 1,200 fatalities and the abduction of 252 Israelis and foreigners. Regrettably, 39 of the 125 hostages still in captivity are feared dead.",

        "description": "These remarks come as Israeli tanks, spotted in central Rafah for the first time since the operation commenced, continued to advance on the southern Gaza city on Wednesday.",
        "text": "This action persists despite mounting global pressure to halt the offensive.   \n         Tel Aviv : Amid intense war with Hamas, Israel on Wednesday cautioned that the war in Gaza might extend until the year’s end, pouring cold waters on hopes that the fighting would end after the military operation against Hamas in Rafah, CNN reported. Tzachi Hanegbi, Israel’s national security adviser, hinted that 2024 had been designated a “year of combat” by Israel’s war cabinet. “We are now in the fifth month of 2024, which means we expect another seven months of fighting to deepen our achievements and achieve our goal of destroying the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and Islamic Jihad,” Hanegbi stated.  \n             These remarks come as Israeli tanks, spotted in central Rafah for the first time since the operation commenced, continued to advance on the southern Gaza city on Wednesday. This action persists despite mounting global pressure to halt the offensive, as reported by CNN. Initially, the Israeli government suggested that entering Rafah would mark the final stage of its war against Hamas, which initiated attacks on Israel in October, resulting in approximately 1,200 casualties and the abduction of around 250 individuals. In response, Israel launched a devastating offensive in Gaza, claiming the lives of over 36,000 people, according to Palestinian officials. Despite earlier considerations for a ceasefire-for-hostages deal with Hamas, the more hawkish faction of Israel’s war cabinet advocated for proceeding with the Rafah offensive, prioritizing the destruction of the group over the return of hostages believed to be in Gaza. \n             \n           Hanegbi’s statements imply that the Rafah operation may not signify the conclusion of hostilities, raising questions about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plans to de-escalate Israel’s campaign and establish post-war governance in Gaza. While Netanyahu has portrayed Rafah as Hamas’ “last bastion,” Israeli forces have been active in northern areas where the military previously claimed to have dismantled militant command structures. During a radio interview on the Israeli station Reshet Bet, Hanegbi emphasised, “It was honestly stated in the first days of presenting the plans to the cabinet that the war would be long.” He urged patience and resilience, cautioning against setting ultimatums, according to CNN.",

        "text": "All Eyes On Rafah:  Over the past three weeks, Israel’s offensive in Rafah has sent nearly a million Palestinians fleeing the southern Gaza city. Most have already been displaced several times during Israel’s nearly 8-month-old war in Gaza, which is aimed at destroying the militant Hamas group but has devastated the territory and caused what the United Nations says is a near-famine. Earlier this week, Israel carried out a deadly Israeli strike at a camp for displaced Palestinians in the Gazan city.  \n             As per an AFP report, an AI-generated image bearing the words “All eyes on Rafah” has been shared by more than 44 million Instagram accounts since Monday. The image depicts a sprawling array of tightly packed tents, stretching far into the horizon in a barren, desert-like environment with distant mountains providing a stark backdrop. This gives an inkling of the sweeping scale of Palestinian refugees that found refuge in such harsh conditions, driven out by the military actions of Israel against Hamas. Pedro Pascal, a celebrated actor of Chilean-American descent, along with Bella and Gigi Hadid, the renowned models of Palestinian descent, and Ousmane Dembele, a French football star, are among the celebrities who have actively shared their thoughts on Instagram. The saying “All eyes on Rafah” has become a popular thread across numerous platforms, especially on X, where the hashtag #alleyesonrafah has skyrocketed in popularity. The online tracking tool Visibrain reports it has captured nearly a million views. \n             \n           Sharing a post on X, Iran’s Embassy in India wrote,”All eyes on Rafah” is a phrase that refers to the ongoing genocide in Rafah, Gaza, with over 1.4 million Palestinians seeking shelter.” \n “All eyes on Rafah” is a phrase that refers to the ongoing genocide in Rafah, Gaza, with over 1.4 million Palestinians seeking shelter. #AllEyesOnRafah #All_eyes_on_Rafah   pic.twitter.com/LnNsXWiZiv \n — Iran in India (@Iran_in_India)  May 6, 2024 Israel persists with its military offensive despite growing global outrage, triggered by an Israeli airstrike on Sunday that killed at least 45 people and injured 200 others in Rafah at a camp for displaced people, previously designated as a safe zone.",

        "description": "A first round of negotiations between Israel and Hamas in November led to the release of about 100 captives in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. But since then talks have largely stalled.",
        "text": "The attacks were carried out in response to the downing of an IDF UAV/drone that was operating in the skies over Lebanon Monday night.    \n         The latest development in the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel sees Hamas expressing readiness to reach a comprehensive agreement, which includes a potential hostage exchange deal. In a statement reported by news agency Reuters, Hamas stated its willingness to engage in negotiations for a ‘complete agreement’ on the condition that Israel ceases its military actions and aggression against the people in Gaza.  \n             Despite an order from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to halt the attacks, Israel has continued its offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israel has justified its actions by emphasizing the rescue of hostages and the elimination of Hamas fighters as the primary objectives of the operation. “Hamas and the Palestinian factions will not accept to be part of this policy by continuing (ceasefire) negotiations in light of the aggression, siege, starvation and genocide of our people”, the Hamas statement read. “Today, we informed the mediators of our clear position that if the occupation stops its war and aggression against our people in Gaza, our readiness (is) to reach a complete agreement that includes a comprehensive exchange deal,” it added. \n             \n           Israel rejects Hamas offers Israel has rejected past Hamas offers as insufficient and said it is determined to wipe out a group bent on its destruction. It says its Rafah offensive is focused on rescuing hostages and rooting out Hamas fighters. Israel had said on Tuesday that its war on Hamas in Gaza would continue all year, after Washington said the Rafah assault did not amount to a major ground operation that would trigger a change in US policy. Talks led by key mediators Qatar, Egypt, and the United States to arrange a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian group that governs Gaza have repeatedly stalled, with both sides blaming the other for the lack of progress. \n The Hamas statement on Thursday came as Israel pressed on with an offensive on Rafah in southern Gaza, despite an order by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the top United Nations court, to halt its assault.  \n Hamas said it showed flexibility during negotiations and that it had entered every previous round of talks with a “positive” spirit, including the last round when it agreed to a mediator-proposed deal on May 6 – shortly after Israeli forces began the widely criticised ground offensive in Rafah.  \n The begining of the war \n More than 240 people were taken captive on October 7 when Hamas fighters launched an attack into southern Israel killing at least 1,139 people, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on Israeli statistics.  \n Israel then launched its war on Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to health officials. The conflict has reduced much of the Palestinian territory to rubble and displaced the vast majority of residents.  \n A first round of negotiations between Israel and Hamas in November led to the release of about 100 captives in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. But since then talks have largely stalled.",

        "text": "Minister of External Affairs of India, Dr S. Jaishankar.   \n         New Delhi:  The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) issued a travel advisory on Friday urging all Indians to avoid non-essential travel to Iran and Israel until further notice due to the escalating tensions in the region. The advisory comes in the wake of a recent Israeli airstrike on an Iranian consulate building in Damascus, Syria, which killed several Iranian military officials, including a senior commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force.  \n             In the advisory, the MEA stated, “In view of the prevailing situation in the region, Indian nationals are advised to avoid all non-essential travel to Iran and Israel until further notice.” \nThe ministry also requested all Indian citizens currently residing in Iran or Israel to get in touch with the Indian Embassies in their respective countries and register themselves. “All those who are currently residing in Iran or Israel are requested to get in touch with Indian Embassies there and register themselves. They are also requested to observe utmost precautions about their safety and restrict their movements to the minimum,” it added. Several other countries have also issued similar travel advisories for their citizens over the last 24 hours, warning them not to travel to the region due to security reasons. \n             \n           The French Foreign Ministry advised its citizens to “refrain absolutely from travelling to Iran, Lebanon, Israeli or Palestinian territories, in the coming days.” (with inputs from IANS)",

        "text": "(Image: www.thedailybeast.com)   \n         Indian Citizens:  India on Friday asked its citizens not to travel to Iran or Israel amid the rising tensions between the two countries after the attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria 11 days ago. Iran has blamed Israel for this attack and it has been feared that Iran may attack Israel soon.  \n             In an advisory, the Ministry of External Affairs has advised Indians living in Iran and Israel to exercise extreme caution about their safety and keep their activities to a minimum. “In view of the prevailing situation in the region, all Indians are advised not to travel to Iran or Israel until further notice,” it said. Contact Indian Embassies “All those who are presently staying in Iran or Israel are requested to contact Indian Embassy there and get themselves registered,” the Ministry of External Affairs said. Iran Could Attack Israel The government’s advice comes amid rising tensions between the two countries after the attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria 11 days ago. Iran has blamed Israel for this attack and it has been feared that Tehran may attack Israel soon. \n             \n           Number Of Indians Present In Both Countries There are about 18,000 Indian nationals in Israel, most of whom are caregivers and professionals in fields such as information technology. Iran is home to about 4,000 Indian nationals, including small businessmen and academics. Last week, India expressed concern over the airstrike on a building of the Iranian embassy compound in Damascus that killed seven people, including Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, senior commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian called the attack “a violation of all international obligations and conventions”. Apart from India, France and Russia have also warned their citizens against travel to the region, already on edge over the war in Gaza, now in its seventh month. The Israeli military said on Thursday it had not issued fresh instructions to civilians, but that its forces were on high alert and prepared for a range of scenarios. Israel’s foreign ministry did not comment on reports that some Israeli diplomatic missions had been partially evacuated and security stepped up. “The revenge will come,” wrote Israel’s largest daily newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth. “For the moment, the premise is that it will be very soon, in the next few days.” Israel did not claim responsibility for the airstrike on April 1 that killed Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps’ overseas Quds Force, and six other officers as they attended a meeting in the Damascus embassy compound. But Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, accused Israel and said it “must be punished and shall be” for an operation he said was equivalent to an attack on Iranian soil. “It’s going to be very difficult for Iran not to retaliate,” said Raz Zimmt, senior researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies. “I still believe that Iran doesn’t want to engage in full-scale, direct military confrontation against Israel, and certainly not with the United States. But it has to do something.” (With Reuters inputs)",

        "text": "Biden Predicts Iran Attack On Israel 'Sooner Than Later'; Warns: 'Don't'  \n   \n         Amid fears of the ongoing hostilities in Gaza devolving into a larger Middle-Eastern conflict, US President Joe Biden on Friday said he expects Iran to attack Israel ‘sooner than later’, CNN reported. “I don’t want to get into secure information but my expectation is sooner than later,” Biden said to reporters when asked how imminent an Iranian attack on Israel would be.” Asked what his message to Iran is right now, the president said, “Don’t.”  \n             “We are devoted to the defense of Israel. We will support Israel we will help defend Israel and Iran will not succeed,” Biden said. The US has been on high alert for a significant Iranian retaliatory attack on Israel in recent days as fears grow of a wider regional war. There remains a “real,” “credible” and “viable” threat of Iran launching strikes, the White House said Friday, following Israel’s attack on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria last week that killed three Iranian generals. The US and several other countries, including Britain and France, issued new travel guidelines for government employees in Israel as the Iranian threat loomed. \n             \n           “We’re watching this very, very closely,” said John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, who declined to provide information about the expected timing of the threat. The US will attempt to intercept any weapons launched at Israel if it’s feasible to do so, two US officials told CNN, an indication of the level of ongoing cooperation between the two militaries. US Navy forces in the Red Sea have previously intercepted long-range missiles launched from the Houthis in Yemen towards Israel. US forces in Iraq and Syria could also potentially intercept drones and rockets targeting northern Israel, depending on the location from which they’re launched. India Asks Its Citizens To Avoid Travelling Iran And Israel Meanwhile, the Ministry of External Affairs has advised Indians to not visit Iran and Israel “in view of the prevailing situation in the region” amid the rising tensions between the two countries after the attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria 11 days ago. “All those who are presently staying in Iran or Israel are requested to contact Indian Embassy there and get themselves registered,” the Ministry of External Affairs said.",

        "text": "Hezbollah supporters wave Hezbollah and Palestinian flags as Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah speaks via a video link during a ceremony to commemorate the death of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, and six officers, who were killed by an Israeli airstrike that demolished Iran's consulate in Syria last Monday, in the southern suburbs of Beirut, Lebanon, Monday, April 8, 2024. (AP Photo)   \n         Israel-Hamas War : Amidst the fears of Iran launching retaliatory strikes against  Israel , nearly two weeks after an  Israeli air strike  on an  Iranian embassy  in  Syria  killed two of Tehran’s top generals,  Hezbollah  Friday launched dozens of short-range missiles towards  northern Israel  which the Tehran-backed Lebanese armed group said was in retaliation to “Zionist aggression” in the region.  \n             According to a Times of Israel report, citing Israeli Defence Forces, some 40 rockets were fired from Lebanon towards northern Israel. However, there were no immediate reports of injuries in the attack as the barrage of missiles were intercepted by Israel’s missile defence systems, while some impacted open areas or fell short in Lebanon. Following the attack, IDF said its air defences shot down two explosive-laden drones launched by Hezbollah in northern Israel. Sirens were sounded as shrapnel fell following the interception of the projectiles directed towards northern Israel.The attack by Hezbollah came amid fears of retaliation by Tehran following the Israeli air strike on the Iranian embassy in Syria that killed two of its top generals, The Times of Israel reported. \n             \n           Hezbollah attacks Israel Later, in a statement, Hezbollah said the rocket attack targeted an IDF base in Ein Zeitim and came in retaliation for the earlier “Zionist aggression.” Notably, Hezbollah-led forces have been attacking Israeli military posts along the border on a near-daily basis since after the October 7 onslaught by Palestinian military group Hamas, which killed over 1,200 people across southern Israel. Hezbollah has said its attacks are in support of Gaza amid the war with Hamas, The Times of Israel reported. US warns of Iran’s impending strike on Israel Earlier, IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a press statement that the Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi concluded an assessment with US CENTCOM chief Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla on the threat of an attack by Iran on Israel. “We held a joint assessment of the situation, to ensure that our coordination is tight,” Hagari said, adding that there are still no changes in instructions to civilians amid the heightened alert of a potential Iranian attack. “If there are any changes, we will update [the public] immediately,” Hagari said, stressing that civilians should still remain vigilant, as Israel’s air defences are “among the best in the world, but not hermetic.” “We have been at war for the past six months, and we have dealt with all the existing threats. Our defense is ready, and knows how to handle each threat individually. We are also ready for attack, with a variety of capabilities, to protect the citizens of Israel,” he said. Iran escalating situation in Middle East, claims IDF The IDF spokesperson also accused Iran of “escalating the situation in the Middle East” amid the war in Gaza, adding, “We will know how to operate wherever needed.” To a question on the IDF’s threat assessments of Iran, Hagari highlighted that Tehran has been acting against Israel since the start of the war, citing attacks by its alleged proxies in Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. “We’ve been acting against them [all] since the start of the war,” he says. “Iran is escalating, pushing for regional escalation. We’ll know how to deal with the Iranian threat. We are well-prepared and will know how to respond to anything,” he said. Aircraft carrier USS Dwight Eisenhower was despatched north through the Red Sea towards Israel in a show of deterrence from the Biden administration. The carrier would be able to intercept missiles and drones fired by Iran. (With ANI inputs)",

        "text": "Breaking News LIVE, April 13, 2024 : While the grim memories of the ethnic violence, which left many dead and scores displaced, still fresh in the minds of voters, 29 special polling stations have been set up ahead of the Lok Sabha elctions for about 5,000 people, who are presently sheltered in camps.

        "description": "The seized ship is named MSC Aries which is operated by the Italian-Swiss group MSC.",
        "text": "This image made from a video provided to The Associated Press by a Mideast defense official shows a helicopter raid targeting a vessel near the Strait of Hormuz on Saturday, April 13, 2024. A video seen by The Associated Press shows commandos raiding a ship near the Strait of Hormuz by helicopter Saturday, an attack a Mideast defense official attributed to Iran amid wider tensions between Tehran and the West. The Mideast defense official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. (AP Photo)   \n         Iran Israel Conflict:  Amidst the already uncertain situation in the volatile region of the Middle East, the commandos from Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard on Saturday abseiled down from a helicopter onto an Israeli-affiliated container ship with 25 crew members near the Strait of Hormuz and seized the vessel.  \n             Of the 25 crew members aboard the ship, 17 are Indian, said the sources privy to the incident. The situation at the moment is said to be “explosive” following the air strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria 11 days ago. Iran has blamed Israel for this attack and it has been feared that Iran may attack Israel soon. MSC Aries The ship has been identified as the MSC Aries operated by the Italian-Swiss group MSC which has confirmed that Iranian authorities had boarded it. \n             \n           A container ship “was seized by the Sepah (Guards) Navy Special Forces by carrying out a heliborne operation,” reported Iran’s state news agency IRNA adding that a special forces unit of the Guard’s navy attacked the vessel, the Portuguese-flagged MSC Aries, a container ship associated with London-based Zodiac Maritime. Zodiac Maritime is part of Israeli billionaire Eyal Ofer’s Zodiac Group. Zodiac declined to comment and referred questions to MSC. Geneva-based MSC later acknowledged the seizure and said 25 crew had been aboard the vessel. IRNA said the Guard would take the vessel into Iranian territorial waters. Meanwhile, Israel has warned that Iran will suffer the “consequences” of escalating the conflict in the region after Iran said that it had seized the ship MSC Aries. “Iran will bear the consequences for choosing to escalate the situation any further,” Daniel Hagari, the military spokesman said in a statement. The Middle East had braced for potential Iranian retaliation over a suspected Israeli strike earlier this month on an Iranian consular building in Syria that killed 12 people, including a senior Guard general who once commanded its expeditionary Quds Force there. The MSC Aries had been last located off Dubai heading toward the Strait of Hormuz on Friday and had turned off its tracking data, which has been common for Israeli-affiliated ships moving through the region. For days, Iranian officials including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have been threatening to “slap” Israel for the Syria strike. Government Of India Issues Statement “Government of India is aware that a cargo ship ‘MSC Aries’ has been taken control by Iran. We have learnt that there are 17 Indian nationals onboard. We are in touch with the Iranian authorities through diplomatic channels, both in Tehran and in Delhi, to ensure security, welfare and early release of Indian nationals,” said government sources.

Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened the meeting of his war cabinet in Tel Aviv, in the wake of Iran’s response to the embassy strike that killed three of its top military generals. As the Iranian attack escalates tensions in the region, US President Joe Biden would meet his national security team at the White House shortly and was being briefed regularly on the escalating tensions in West Asia after Iran launched drones towards Israel in response to the air strike on its embassy in Syria, the White House informed on Saturday. In the statement, White House National Security Council Spokesperson, Adrienne Watson said President Biden’s team was in constant communication with Israeli officials as well as other partners, adding that American support for Israel’s security remains ‘ironclad’.",

        "description": "The attack marked the first time Iran has launched a direct military assault on Israel, despite decades of enmity dating back to the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
        "text": "Israeli Iron Dome air defense system launches to intercept missiles fired from Iran, in central Israel, Sunday, April 14, 2024. Iran launched its first direct military attack against Israel on Saturday.  (AP Photo)   \n         Booms and air raid sirens sounded across  Israel  early Sunday after  Iran  launched hundreds of drones,  ballistic missiles  and  cruise missiles  in an unprecedented revenge mission that pushed the  Middle East  closer to a region-wide war.  \n             The attack marked the first time Iran has launched a direct military assault on Israel, despite decades of enmity dating back to the country’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. Condemnation from the United Nations chief and others was swift, with France saying Iran “is risking a potential military escalation,” Britain calling the attack “reckless” and Germany saying Iran and its proxies “must stop it immediately.” Israeli military’s spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said Iran fired scores of drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles — with the vast majority intercepted outside Israel’s borders. He said warplanes intercepted over 10 cruise missiles alone, also outside Israeli airspace. Hagari said a handful of missiles landed in Israel. Rescuers said one strike critically wounded a 10-year-old girl in a Bedouin Arab town in southern Israel. Hagari said a missile struck an army base, causing light damage but no injuries. \n             \n           “A wide-scale attack by Iran is a major escalation,” he said. Asked whether Israel would respond, Hagari said only that the army “does and will do whatever is required to protect the security of the state of Israel.” U.S. forces downed some of the Iran-launched drones flying toward Israel, according to a U.S. defense official and two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter. Israel’s military said its Arrow system handled most interceptions and noted that “strategic partners” were involved. Iran had vowed revenge since an April 1 airstrike in Syria killed two Iranian generals inside an Iranian consular building. Iran accused Israel of being behind the attack. Israel hasn’t commented on it. Israel and Iran have been on a collision course throughout Israel’s six-month war against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. The war erupted after Hamas and Islamic Jihad, two militant groups backed by Iran, carried out a devastating cross-border attack on Oct. 7 that killed 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 250 others. An Israeli offensive in Gaza has caused widespread devastation and killed over 33,000 people, according to local health officials. Almost immediately after the war erupted, Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militant group in Lebanon, began attacking Israel’s northern border. The two sides have been involved in daily exchanges of fire, while Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen have launched rockets and missiles toward Israel. In a statement carried late Saturday by Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency, the country’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard acknowledged launching “dozens of drones and missiles towards the occupied territories and positions of the Zionist regime.” In a later statement, the Revolutionary Guard issued a direct warning to the U.S.: “The terrorist U.S. government is warned any support or participation in harming Iran’s interests will be followed by decisive and regretting response by Iran’s armed forces.” IRNA also quoted an anonymous official saying ballistic missiles were part of the attack. A ballistic missile moves on an arch trajectory, heading up into space before gravity brings the weapon down at a speed several times faster than the speed of sound. Israel has a multilayered air-defense network that includes systems capable of intercepting a variety of threats including long-range missiles, cruise missiles, drones and short-range rockets. However, in a massive attack involving multiple drones and missiles, the likelihood of a strike making it through is higher. Iran has a vast arsenal of drones and missiles. Online videos shared by Iranian state television purported to show delta-wing-style drones resembling the Iranian Shahed-136s long used by Russia in its war on Ukraine. The slow-flying drones carry bombs. Ukraine has successfully used both surface-to-air missiles and ground fire to target them. Some Israelis watched the interceptions light up the night sky. Air raid sirens were reported in numerous places including northern Israel, southern Israel, the northern West Bank and the Dead Sea near the Jordanian border. Israel’s army ordered residents in the Golan Heights — near the Syrian and Lebanese borders — as well as the southern towns of Nevatim and Dimona and the Red Sea resort of Eilat “to stay near protective spaces until further notice.” Dimona is home to Israel’s main nuclear facility, and Nevatim has a major air base. The army’s Home Front Command canceled school Sunday and limited public gatherings to no more than 1,000 people. Israel and some other countries in the region closed their airspace. Earlier, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned: “Whoever harms us, we will harm them.” In Washington, President Joe Biden convened a principals meeting of the National Security Council to discuss the attack. Biden again said in the face of Iran’s threats that his commitment to Israel’s security is “ironclad” — a change from the harsh criticism voiced in recent weeks over the war in Gaza. Gen. Erik Kurilla, the head of the U.S. military’s Central Command, was in Israel over the weekend consulting with Israeli defense officials. The Central Command oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East. Iran’s mission to the United Nations issued a warning to both Israel and the U.S. “Should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe,” it wrote online. “It is a conflict between Iran and the rogue Israeli regime, from which the U.S. MUST STAY AWAY!” For days, Iranian officials including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had threatened to “slap” Israel for the Syria strike. In Iran’s capital, Tehran, witnesses saw long lines at gas stations early Sunday as people appeared worried about what may come next. Dozens of hard-liners demonstrated in support of the attack at Palestine Square. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported heavy Israeli airstrikes and shelling on multiple locations in south Lebanon following Iran’s launch of drones. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it launched “dozens” of Katyusha rockets at an Israeli military site in the Golan Heights early Sunday. It was not immediately clear if there was any damage. Iranian missiles or drones were intercepted in the sky above the Jordanian capital, Amman. In Lebanon’s capital, Beirut, and elsewhere in the country, residents reported seeing missiles in the sky and hearing explosions, likely from interceptions. In Syria, explosions were heard in the capital, Damascus, and elsewhere. Britain-based war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Syrian air defenses tried to shoot down Israeli attempts to intercept Iranian missiles.

        "text": "Iranians celebrate on a street, after the IRGC attack on Israel, in Tehran (Photo/Reuters)   \n         New York (US):  In the wake of the Iranian drone strikes on its soil in response to the attack on its consulate in Syria, Israel put in a request with the United Nations Security Council to immediately convene a meeting to unequivocally condemn Iran and designate its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation.  \n             “I confirm Israel’s request to convene a meeting of the Security Council immediately to unequivocally condemn Iran for these grave violations and immediately act to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization,” Israel’s permanent representative to UN, Gilad Erdan stated in a letter to the president of the UN Security Council. “Six months after Hamas’ brutal terror attack on October 7, I wish to express my outrage regarding the attack against the State of Israel by the Iranian regime, which once again undermines Security Council resolutions, fosters instability, and poses a grave threat to international peace and security,” he added in his latter. Israel also shared details of the Iranian attacks on Saturday, saying that more than 200 UAVs, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles were launched towards the enemy country. \n             \n           “Iran has launched a direct attack from within its territory of more than 200 UAVs, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles towards Israel in clear violation of the UN Charter and international law. Iran has also publicly taken pride in the attack. The attack is a severe and dangerous escalation,” it said. “Iran continues to violate its international obligations, evidenced by today’s attack on Israel in violation of Security Council resolution 2231 (2015), and by accelerating the pace of its weapons transfers to Hezbollah in violation of Security Council Resolution 1701. Iran has been the architect of instability for years, through Hamas, the Houthis, Hezbollah and other proxies. But it is now standing front and center in its actions to fulfill its ambition to attack Israel,” it added. Israel said Iran poses a direct threat to the international peace and violated the UN Charter, adding that time has come for the Security Council to address the ‘Iranian threat.’ “The Iranian attack follows the seizure of a Portuguese civilian cargo ship by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. The gravity and volume of the attacks are unprecedented, and are a flagrant violation of Israel’s sovereignty, of international law, and of Security Council resolutions. Iran poses a direct threat to international peace, and brazenly violates the UN Charter and Security Council resolutions. The time has come for the Security Council to take concrete action against the Iranian threat,” the letter read. After Iran launched drones into Israel in retaliation for the air strike on its embassy in Syria, the UK moved several additional Royal Air Force jets and air refuelling tankers to the region, the country’s Ministry of Defence said in a statement on Sunday. It said the deployed jets will intercept airborne attacks within range of the UK’s existing mission. Meanwhile, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Saturday that Israel “intercepted a vast majority” of the strikes from Iran. IDF estimates that Iran launched over “200 different kinds” of drones, including killer drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, Hagari said in response to a question, CNN reported. “Our planes are still in the air intercepting targets and we are ready for any threat that will come to Israel,” Hagari said, adding, “We will do everything we need, everything to defend the state of Israel.”",

(AP Photo)   \n         Israel-Hamas War:  Palestinian militant group Hamas has rejected a proposal for partial ceasefire and hostage exchange by Israel and reasserted its original demands for a permanent ceasefire in the embattled Gaza Strip.  \n             In its response to Israel’s proposal, Hamas has stuck to its original demands for a permanent ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the entirety of Gaza, the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza and other areas, a surge in humanitarian aid and the start of the Strip’s reconstruction, Xinhua reported. According to Xinhua, Hamas issued a statement, emphasising its readiness to conclude a “serious and genuine” prisoner-hostage exchange deal with Israel that the faction had received on April 8. Later, the Israeli Prime Minister’s office said it rejected the ‘unfounded demands’ of Hamas for an end to the Gaza war and a complete withdrawal of its troops from the enclave. \n             \n           As per the report, the Israel PM’s office asserted that Benjamin Netanyahu’s and Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) were united in their opposition to these demands. The office said political instruction given to negotiations focuses on “achieving the release of our hostages and maintaining Israel’s security”. It argued that the only obstacle to obtaining the release of the Israeli hostages is Hamas and “not any factor on the Israeli side,” and that Hamas “has refused any deal and any compromise proposal.” On Monday, Cairo hosted a new round of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas, in a new attempt to reach agreements leading to a ceasefire and a prisoner exchange. Palestinian sources told Xinhua that the mediators presented a new proposal in the Cairo talks, including a three-stage ceasefire, without specifying a complete withdrawal of Israel from the Gaza Strip. The first stage enables the return of ‘non-armed’ displaced civilians to the northern Gaza Strip, without specifying their numbers, the opening of the Rashid and Salah al-Din streets with Israel’s forces stationed 500 metres away. It also includes entering 500 aid trucks daily into all areas of Gaza and releasing 900 Palestinian prisoners, including 100 with life sentences. The proposed second stage initiates the release of all Israeli prisoners and the conclusion of negotiations for a sustainable calm. Qatari and Egyptian mediators, in addition to the United States, seek to reach a deal for a prisoner exchange and a second truce between Israel and Hamas, following the first one that lasted a week until the beginning of December, last year.

(REUTERS)   \n         Iran Attacks Israel:   Israel  Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  chaired a war cabinet meeting in the wake of an unprecedented direct attack by  Iran  on the Jewish nation on early Sunday. The US, UK, Canada, and the UN condemned the brazen assault, with  President Joe Biden  reaffirming America’s “ironclad commitment” to  Israel  and moving to convene a meeting of the G-7 leaders to develop a coordinated response to the  Iranian attack .  \n             “Earlier today, Iran—and its proxies operating out of Yemen, Syria and Iraq—launched an unprecedented air attack against military facilities in Israel. I condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms,” Biden said after his call with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu. Over 200 drones, missiles fired at Israel Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) said Iran launched more than 200 drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles were launched towards its territory on Saturday. Israeli military’s spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said Iran fired scores of drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles — with the vast majority intercepted outside Israel’s borders.

Immediately after the attack started, Netanyahu, called a meeting of his war cabinet and later spoke to the US President who reassured the Israeli PM of “America’s ironclad commitment to the security of Israel”. Biden said at his direction, to support the defence of Israel, the US military moved aircraft and ballistic missile defence destroyers to the region over the course of the past week. “Thanks to these deployments and the extraordinary skill of our servicemembers, we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles,” he said. “I’ve just spoken with Prime Minister Netanyahu to reaffirm America’s ironclad commitment to the security of Israel,” he said. Biden to convene G-7 meeting Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks – sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten its security, he said. President Biden said he will convene a meeting for G-7 leaders to coordinate a response to the Iranian attack. “Tomorrow, I will convene my fellow G-7 leaders to coordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran’s brazen attack. My team will engage with their counterparts across the region. And we will stay in close touch with Israel’s leaders. And while we have not seen attacks on our forces or facilities today, we will remain vigilant to all threats and will not hesitate to take all necessary action to protect our people,” Biden said. Canada condemns Iranian attack Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unequivocally condemned Iran’s airborne attacks against Israel. “We stand with Israel. After supporting Hamas’ brutal October 7 attack, the Iranian regime’s latest actions will further destabilise the region and make lasting peace more difficult,” he said. “These attacks demonstrate yet again the Iranian regime’s disregard for peace and stability in the region. We support Israel’s right to defend itself and its people from these attacks,” Trudeau said. US closely monitoring situation Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said that American forces remain postured to protect its troops and partners in the region, provide further support for Israel’s defence, and enhance regional stability. “We condemn these reckless and unprecedented attacks by Iran and its proxies, and we call on Iran to immediately halt any further attacks, including from its proxy forces, and to de-escalate tensions. We do not seek conflict with Iran, but we will not hesitate to act to protect our forces and support the defence of Israel,” he said. Austin said he will continue to monitor the situation closely and to consult with US allies and partners. He also spoke with Israeli Minister of Defence Yoav Gallant to discuss urgent regional threats and reiterated unwavering US support for Israel’s defence. During the call, Austin made clear that Israel could count on full US support to defend Israel against any attacks by Iran and its regional proxies, his spokesperson said on Saturday. UN calls for immediate cessation of hostilities The United Nations also condemned Iran’s aerial attack on Israel and voiced concern over the escalation of hostilities between the two enemy nations which could trigger a full-scale region-wide war in the Middle East. In a statement, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the Iranian attack and called “for an immediate cessation of these hostilities”. “I am deeply alarmed about the very real danger of a devastating region-wide escalation. I urge all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid any action that could lead to major military confrontations on multiple fronts in the Middle East,” he said. UN General Assembly Dennis Francis expressed deep concerns about the unfolding situation in the Middle East, involving the launch by Iran of drones and missiles against Israel. “The Iranians have explained their action in the context of article 51 of the UN Charter, following the recent Israeli attack on the Iranian Embassy in Damascus. The Iranian response compounds the already tense and delicate peace and security situation in the Middle East,” he said and called upon all parties to exercise the utmost restraint to avoid further escalation of tension in the region. This is a moment that calls for wise and prudent judgement, in which the risks and extended risks are very carefully considered, he said. “I expect that the Iranian authorities will honour their word that by their action today, the matter can be deemed concluded. A vicious cycle of attack and counter-attack will lead to nowhere, but inevitably, to more death, suffering and misery. Dialogue and diplomacy are the only way to resolve any differences through peaceful means,” Francis said. Iran attacks Israel Iran launched an unprecedented attack against Israel on early Sunday morning, firing hundreds of drones,  ballistic missiles  and  cruise missiles  at targets inside the Jewish nations, thus pushing the  Middle East  closer to a region-wide war. The attack marked the first time Iran has launched a direct military assault on Israel, despite decades of enmity dating back to the country’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. Condemnation from the United Nations chief and others was swift, with France saying Iran “is risking a potential military escalation,” Britain calling the attack “reckless” and Germany saying Iran and its proxies “must stop it immediately.” Iran had vowed to retaliate for a strike on its consulate in Syria on 1 April which killed seven IRGC officers, including a top commander. It accused Israel of carrying out that attack, but Israel neither confirmed nor denied it. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said the attack was aimed at “specific targets”.

In response to the suspected  Israeli Strike  on April 1, 2024 on the Iranian Consulate in Syria, Iran attacked the nation with about 300 missiles and drones on Saturday night; while most rockets were intercepted by the  Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) , the attack has still resulted in destruction. In an unfortunate news, the attack caused grave injuries to a  seven-year-old Israeli girl  who has hit by a shrapnel; while she is being tended to, in a hospital, her condition is still severe. This update about the ongoing  Iran-Israel War  has been given by the  Israeli Ambassador to India, Naor Gilon . Check latest news and updates…  \n             Iran-Israel War: 7-Year-Old Girl Injured, In Serious Condition As mentioned earlier, following Iran’s attack on Israel with over 300 drones and missiles on Saturday night, Israeli Ambassador to India, Naor Gilon, highlighted that a seven-year-old girl was hit by a shrapnel, adding that she has now been treated but is still in severe condition. While most rockets were intercepted, the Ambassador said, “There was, unfortunately one casualty, a seven year old child, who was hit by shrapnel from, probably from one of the interceptors. We don’t know exactly. Unfortunately, she was wounded and she’s treated, but in severe conditions still.” Iran Financier, Trainer, Equipper Of Hamas And Hezbollah: Israeli Envoy The Israeli envoy further told ANI that Iran is the financier, trainer and equipper of Hamas and Hezbollah, and all of them are fighting with Israel. “Iran is the financer, trainer and equipper of Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon…in Iraq and Syria, the Houthis in Yemen, all of them are fighting with us. And what happened yesterday is that Iran turned it from a war by proxy to a direct attack on Israel,” he said. “From the Iranian country to Israel, they fired 331 rockets, different kinds of rockets, cruise missiles, and UAVs,” Gilon added. Moreover, he stressed that the Israel Defence Forces were able to intercept 99 per cent of the incoming rockets. “With the help of some of our friends in the region, but mostly by the capabilities of the Israeli defense forces and air force, we were able to intercept 99% of the incoming rockets,” he told ANI. \n             \n           Israel Iran War: Israeli Schools, Colleges Closed; Defence Forces On High Alert Israel, in a move to protect its citizens, has announced to close all schools and other educational systems, effective Sunday, as the country’s defence forces remain on high alert following Iran hitting Israel with over 200 projectiles, the Jerusalem Post reported. Moreover, it further urged the Israeli civilians to be vigilant, to head to shelters upon hearing a warning siren, and to remain there for 10 minutes. The Iran-Israel War comes at a time when Israel is already fighting Palestine and is not ready to give up; these constant attacks are resulting in grave losses of both life and property in several countries. The attacks are an unfortunate example of what wars do, to civilians and their lives which have now probably changed forever. (Inputs from ANI)",

        "text": "Hamas submitted its response to Israel's hostage deal negotiations and ceasefire and rejected the latter's proposal, sticking to its original demands, Xinhua reported..   \n         Tel Aviv : Amid ongoing war between Israel and Hamas and after rejecting the Israeli proposal of a ceasefire in Gaza, Hamas has now presented a ceasefire and hostage release deal to mediators, demanding that Israel observe a six-week ceasefire before it receives any of the 129 hostages held by the terror group since October 7, The Times of Israel reported citing a report by Hebrew daily, Haaretz.  \n             The terror group’s proposal was reportedly submitted after it rejected the US-mediated deal on Saturday late at night. In the proposal, Hamas put a condition on the Israel Defence Force (IDF) that it would be required to cease all fighting in Gaza and retreat from urban areas for six weeks, allowing displaced Palestinians to return north, The Times of Israel reported. It added that only after the end of the six weeks would any hostages be released, stating further that it would use the weeks of paused hostilities to locate the hostages and ascertain what condition they are in. \n             \n           The terror group’s draft added that 30 Palestinian prisoners would be released for every Israeli civilian, a steep increase from the 3:1 ratio of the weeklong November truce. It also demanded that 50 Palestinian prisoners, 30 of them serving life sentences, be released for every captive soldier. The Times of Israel reported that Israel has previously dismissed similar demands as ‘delusional’ and the number of Palestinian prisoners Hamas has demanded, as well as the severity of their crimes, has been a sticking point in several previous rounds of negotiations. Earlier, on Saturday, Hamas submitted its response to Israel’s hostage deal negotiations and ceasefire and rejected the latter’s proposal, sticking to its original demands, Xinhua reported. The terror group said it was sticking to its original demands for a permanent ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the entirety of Gaza, the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza and other areas, a surge in humanitarian aid and the start of the Strip’s reconstruction.

        "description": "Over a phone call with the Israeli PM, Biden said he should consider Saturday a 'win' because Iran's attacks had been largely unsuccessful and demonstrated Israel's superior military capability, a senior administration official said.",
        "text": "Joe Biden said that he would not cut off weapons like the Iron Dome missile interceptors, which are crucial for protecting Israeli civilians from rocket attacks.   \n         Washington : Amid fresh war between Israel and Iran, US President Joe Biden made it clear to his counterparts that America will not get drawn into any offensive action against Iran after it launched a barrage of missiles against Israel on Saturday, CNN reported, citing US officials familiar with the matter.  \n             In the conversation between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Biden following the successful interception of Iranian drones and missiles by Israel’s advanced air defence system, Biden suggested that further Israeli response was unnecessary. Over a phone call with the Israeli PM, Biden said he should consider Saturday a ‘win’ because Iran’s attacks had been largely unsuccessful and demonstrated Israel’s superior military capability, a senior administration official said. The US assessed that there was “no significant damage within Israel itself,” CNN reported, according to a senior US military official. \n             \n           Earlier, Iran came out in defence of its retaliatory attack on Israel on Saturday in response to an attack on its consulate in Syria, saying that the “matter can be deemed concluded”. In a stern warning for Israel’s closest ally, Iran asked US to stay away from the ongoing conflict with Israel, adding that its response will be more severe if Israel made ‘another mistake’. “Conducted on the strength of Article 51 of the UN Charter pertaining to legitimate defense, Iran’s military action was in response to the Zionist regime’s aggression against our diplomatic premises in Damascus. The matter can be deemed concluded,” Iran’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York posted on X.” However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe. It is a conflict between Iran and the rogue Israeli regime, from which the U.S. MUST STAY AWAY!,” it added. Meanwhile, Israeli President, Isaac Herzog said his country was not seeking war with Iran after the latter’s attack, adding that “balance is needed in this situation,” CNN reported. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is speaking with many world leaders and there is “intimate dialogue with allies” in response to Iran’s actions, he said. “We’re considering it all. We’re acting cool-headedly and lucidly,” President Herzog said, adding, “I think we’re operating in a very focused way and very responsible way and I’m sure there will be a decision accordingly that will make sure that we protect and defend the people of Israel.” Earlier, on Sunday, the national security spokesman at the White House, John Kirby, said the ability to prevent widespread damage was a demonstration of Israel’s ‘military superiority’ and proof that Iran was not the “military power that they claim to be.” “This was an incredible success, really proving Israel’s military superiority and, just as critically, their diplomatic superiority, that they have friends in the region, that they have around the world that are willing to help them,” Kirby told CNN. Meanwhile, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin asked his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, to notify the US ahead of any potential response to the Iranian attack, according to another US official.",

        "text": "Emergency Meeting On Iran-Israel Tensions: ‘Neither Region Nor World Can Afford More War’, Says UN Chief   \n         New York:  Given the escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday. Addressing the meeting, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that ‘Middle East’ was on the brink emphasizing that neither the region nor the world can afford more war. Notably, the meeting was held following Iran’s drone and missile attacks on Israel.  \n             Citing the escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday. Addressing the meeting, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the ‘Middle East’ was on the brink, emphasizing that neither the region nor the world can afford more war. Notably, the meeting was held following Iran’s drone and missile attacks on Israel. “We have a shared responsibility to work for peace. Regional–and indeed global–peace and security are being undermined by the hour. Neither the region nor the world can afford more war,” Guterres said in his statement. “The Middle East is on the brink. The people of the region are confronting a real danger of a devastating full-scale conflict. Now is the time to defuse and de-escalate. Now is the time for maximum restraint,” he added. \n             \n           He also condemned the Iranian air raids into Israel to avenge the attack on its embassy in Syria, which left three of its top military generals dead, while calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities. “I strongly condemn the serious escalation represented by the large-scale attack launched on Israel by the Islamic Republic of Iran this evening. And I call for an immediate cessation of these hostilities,” the UN said. “I remind all Member States that the Charter of the United Nations prohibits the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations,” he added. Guterres also dwelt on the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, reiterating the UN’s call for immediate ceasefire and unconditional release of all hostages. “We have a shared responsibility to secure an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, and the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid,” he said. “We have a shared responsibility to stop violence in the occupied West Bank, de-escalate the situation along the Blue Line, and re-establish safe navigation in the Red Sea,” he added. Israel has put a call inside the United Nations Security Council chambers, seeking a swift gathering in light of the recent Iranian assault. They aim to not only reprimand Iran severely, but declare its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a group promoting terror. Israel voiced problems over Iran’s pointed threat towards international peace, a glaring disrespect of the UN Charter. They’re virtually begging the Security Council to not dawdle but confront this ‘Iranian threat’ head-on, and without wasting time.",

As a result, projections suggest that petrol prices could increase by PKR 2.50 to PKR 2.80 per litre, while HSD prices may rise by PKR 8 to PKR 8.50 per litre, pending final calculations, as per Dawn. The import premium on petrol has dropped by almost 21 per cent to USD 10.7 per barrel over the last fortnight when compared to USD 13.50 in last few days of March and the rupee strengthened by about 40 paisa against a dollar to USD 278.20. \n             \n           According to Dawn, the net impact is estimated to be about USD 2.80 per litre increase in petrol price from the existing rate of USD 289.41. The HSD price, on the other hand, was up in the international market and its import premium paid by the benchmark Pakistan State Oil remained unchanged at USD 6.50 per barrel. HSD rate was thus estimated to be higher by PKR 8 to PKR 8.50 per litre, subject to a final exchange rate adjustment in pricing, from the current rate of PKR 282.24 per litre at the depot stage. For the purpose of price calculations, officials said the petrol price had gone up by about USD 4 per barrel to USD 98.5 last week, while the HSD price went up by USD 4.50 per barrel to USD 102.9. Nearly two weeks ago, the government implemented a price hike of PKR 9.66 per litre for petrol and a reduction of PKR 3.32 per litre for high-speed diesel (HSD), effective until April 15. The government has also reached the maximum permissible limit of PKR 60 per litre in petroleum levy, as mandated by law, for both petrol and HSD. Under the commitments made with the International Monetary Fund, the government had set a budget target to collect PKR 869bn as a petroleum levy on petroleum products during the current fiscal year. It has already collected about PKR 475bn in the first half (July-December) of the fiscal year, though the government is expected to mop up about PKR 970bn by the end of the year, despite the revised target of PKR 920bn by the end of June. Currently, the government is charging about PKR 82 per litre in taxes on both petrol and HSD. (With inputs from ANI)",

        "text": "Iran Israel War   \n         Washington : Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder has said that the additional United States military assets that were moved into the Middle East before Iran’s attack on Israel will remain in place, CNN reported. “As (Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin) has said, both publicly and privately, we don’t want to see escalation, but we obviously will take necessary measures to protect our forces in the region and as was demonstrated over the weekend, we’ll take necessary measures to defend Israel,” Ryder said.  \n             The statement from Ryder comes as Israel debates possible retaliation to Iran’s attack. Earlier, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief of staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi vowed answer to the Iranian attack and said that Iran’s attack on Israel “will be met with a response.” “Iran wanted to harm the strategic capabilities of the State of Israel, this is something that did not happen in the past,” Halevi said while addressing troops at Nevatim airbase, which was hit in the strike. \n             \n           “We were prepared in the ‘Iron Shield’ operation, this preparation brought Iran to also meet air superiority, which you expressed (manifested) very well,” he said, CNN reported. Halevi said that Israel had intelligence of Iran’s strike since last Monday, adding that Israel is “very strong and knows how to deal with it on its own.” Meanwhile, amid fears of Israel response, US Secretary of Defence Llyod Austin spoke with the acting Deputy Prime Minister of Kuwait, Sheikh Fahad Youssef Al-Sabah and discussed the unprecedented attack by Iran on Israel, adding that US does not seek escalation, an official statement said. “Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III spoke with Kuwaiti Acting Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, and Minister of Interior, His Excellency Sheikh Fahad Youssef Al-Sabah today to discuss the unprecedented attacks launched from Iranian territory and by Iran’s proxies in the region into Israel, and U.S. and coalition efforts to defend Israel,” Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement. (With Inputs From ANI)",

        "description": "Iran launched hundreds of drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles at Israel in the attack. The Israeli military said that 99% of the drones and missiles were intercepted",
        "text": "Demonstrators wave a huge Iranian flag in their anti-Israeli gathering in front of an anti-Israeli banner on the wall of a building at the Felestin (Palestine) Sq. in Tehran, Iran, Monday, April 15, 2024.  (AP Photo)   \n         Iran-Israel Conflict :  Israel  military chief Monday said there will be a response to the weekend’s missile attack by  Iran  and asserted that the country will do so at the the time of its choosing, without elaborating on when and how even as world leaders have urged the  Jewish nation  against retaliation in attempts to curb escalation of conflict in the  Middle East .  \n             Israel’s military chief Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi Monda that Israel is considering its next steps but that the Iranian strike “will be met with a response”, however, he did not give any specific details while the army’s spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said Israel will respond “at the time that we choose.” Speaking at the Nevatim air base in southern Israel, which according to Hagari, suffered only light damage in the Iranian attack, said that Israel will respond at a “time of our own choosing”., Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been huddling with top officials to discuss a possible response, but for a second straight day, the Israeli government made no announcements on any decisions. \n             \n           In a conversation with U.S. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Netanyahu said that “Israel will do whatever is required to defend itself,” the prime minister’s office announced. US urges restraint While Israeli leaders have hinted at retaliation, the government is under heavy international pressure not to further escalate the conflict — especially after the Iranian strike caused such little damage. The United States has urged Israel to show restraint as it seeks to build a broad diplomatic response. Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, said any response is up to Israel to decide, he added: “We don’t want to see escalation, but we obviously will take necessary measures to protect our forces in the region.” Pressed at a briefing about whether such a response would jeopardize stability in the region, Ryder said the U.S. will “stay in close consultation with our Israeli partners, as we have done throughout the weekend. Again, we don’t seek wider regional conflict.” Retaliation against Iran will sour relations with Arab nations The U.S. also has been working in recent years to strengthen ties between Israel and moderate Arab states in an alliance to counter Iran. Much of that cooperation has been under the umbrella of the U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East. Centcom works closely with militaries across the region, including Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries. The U.S., Britain and Jordan — a key American ally in the region — have all said their air forces helped intercept the Iranian missiles and drones. Halevi said France and “other partners” were involved, and he noted that “Iran’s attack has created new opportunities for cooperation in the Middle East.” The Iranian weapons also flew through Saudi skies, according to a map released by the Israeli military. Israel says most of the interceptions took place outside of Israeli airspace, indicating at least tacit cooperation with the Saudis. A unilateral Israeli strike could strain these behind-the-scenes contacts, particularly with countries like Saudi Arabia that do not have official diplomatic relations with Israel. It also could risk opening a new front with Iran at a time when Israel is bogged down in a six-month war inside Gaza against Hamas militants. World leaders press Israel not to strike Iran British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said “all sides must show restraint” to avoid a rising spiral of violence in the Middle East. French President Emmanuel Macron said Paris will try to “convince Israel that we must not respond by escalating.” In Washington, U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby declined to say Monday whether the U.S. had been or expects to be briefed on any Israeli response plans. “We will let the Israelis speak to that,” he said. “We are not involved in their decision-making process about a potential response,” Kirby said. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. doesn’t seek escalation but said it would continue to support Israel’s security. He pledged to step up the diplomatic efforts against Iran. “Strength and wisdom need to be different sides of the same coin,” he said. Iran strikes Israel The Iranian attack on Saturday came in response to a suspected Israeli strike two weeks earlier on an Iranian consular building in the Syrian capital of Damascus that killed two Iranian generals. It marked the first time Iran has launched a direct military assault on Israel despite decades of enmity dating back to the country’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iran launched hundreds of drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles at Israel in the attack. The Israeli military said that 99% of the drones and missiles were intercepted, by Israel’s own air defenses and warplanes and in coordination with a U.S.-led coalition of partners. Israel and Iran have been on a collision course throughout the Gaza war. The war erupted after Hamas and Islamic Jihad, two militant groups backed by Iran, carried out a devastating cross-border attack on Oct. 7 that killed 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 250 others. Israel’s military offensive in Gaza has killed over 33,700 Palestinians, majority of them civilians, including women and children, according to local health officials, and caused widespread devastation. Throughout the war, Israel has traded fire across its northern border with Lebanon’s Iranian-backed Hezbollah militant group, while Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Yemen have also attacked Israel. The friction has kept up fears of a potentially destructive all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah, or a broader direct confrontation between Israel and Iran.

        "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets United States (US) National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, in New Delhi. (File Photo: ANI)   \n         US National Security Advisor  (NSA)  Jake Sullivan  has postponed his visit to India this week in wake of ongoing tensions between  Iran  and  Israel  after the former’s brazen missile attack on the  Jewish  nation this weekend.  \n             According to a US Embassy spokesperson NSA Sullivan will miss this week’s trip to India due to the ongoing crisis in the Middle East and looks forward to holding the Initiative for Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) annual review at the next earliest possible date. “Due to ongoing events in the Middle East, NSA Sullivan has postponed his trip to India this week. NSA Sullivan looks forward to holding the Initiative for Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) annual review at the next earliest possible date and remains personally committed to advancing our deeply consequential and multifaceted partnership with India,” the spokesperson said. Notably, this is the second time in three months that NSA Jake Sullivan has postponed his visit to India. Sullivan was scheduled to travel to India earlier this year in February for the annual review meeting on iCET, but his plans changed due to the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel’s war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. \n             \n           Later, Sullivan was scheduled to visit New Delhi on April 7 but his trip to India has been postponed once again. The spokesperson said that US President Joe Biden is also looking forward to the next meeting of the Quad leaders and “continuing our efforts with India to deliver results for the American and Indian people, as well as our partners, in support of our shared vision for a free, open, and prosperous Indo-Pacific.” In May 2022, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden launched iCET to facilitate outcome-oriented cooperation in new and emerging technologies. iCET is co-led by the NSCS in India and the US National Security Council (NSC). In February this year, Defence Secretary Giridhar Aramane, while speaking at the second edition of INDUS-X Summit in New Delhi, highlighted robust defence partnership between India and the US, rooted in mutual respect and strategic convergence.

        "text": "Image tweeted by @indiannavy   \n         Thrissur : Antessa Joseph is one of the Kerala woman among 17 other Indians who has been trapped in a cargo ship seized by Iran. She was among others onboard an Israel-linked cargo ship seized by Iran in the gulf region, her family has said.  \n             The family of the woman, Antessa Joseph, said in a video shown on TV channels that she was also among the crew of the ship, but there was no mention of her in the Kerala Chief Minister’s letter to the External Affairs Ministry. Subsequently, an official in the Chief Minister’s Office said that initially there was no information about the presence of the woman. When they came to know about it, the matter was taken up with the Central government, the official said. \n             \n           The Department of Non-Resident Keralites Affairs (NORKA) has also been directed to take necessary steps, the official added. Who is Antessa Joseph? As per her family sources, Antessa was part of the crew, whose name was omitted from an official communication by Kerala’s Chief Minister to the Ministry of External Affairs. This has led to heightened anxiety and calls for swift governmental intervention. Later, the CMO clarified that the initial oversight was due to a lack of information regarding Antessa’s presence on the ship. Measures are now being taken, with the Department of Non-Resident Keralites Affairs (NORKA) being directed to assist in the matter. Her father said that he has not received any updates from the state or the Central governments regarding his daughter’s current status. “It is the company, which owns the ship, that has informed me that my daughter is safe,” he said. He further said that he last spoke to his daughter on Friday. “She calls every morning regularly. When that did not happen on the next day, we tried to call her, but could not reach her. Then in the afternoon, the company which owns the ship called and told us what happened,” he said. What Iran Said About Indians Trapped in The Ship In the meantime, Iran has said that Tehran will “soon” allow Indian authorities to meet the 17 Indian crew members onboard the cargo vessel. Vijayan had on Sunday sought the intervention of the External Affairs Ministry for the safe return of the Indian nationals including three from the state who are onboard the vessel. The ship – MSC Aries – was seized by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards near the Strait of Hormuz on Saturday, April 13.",

        "text": "White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan's remarks came after US President Joe Biden denounced the attacks on Israel as 'pure unadulterated evil'.   \n         Washington : Days after Iran launched a series of missiles on Israel, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that the US will impose new sanctions on Iran’s missile and drone programmes and new sanctions against entities backing the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Iran’s Defence Ministry in the coming days.  \n             In a statement, Sullivan said, “Following Iran’s unprecedented air attack against Israel, President Biden is coordinating with allies and partners, including the G7, and with bipartisan leaders in Congress, on a comprehensive response.” “In the coming days, the United States will impose new sanctions targeting Iran, including its missile and drone program as well as new sanctions against entities supporting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Iran’s Defence Ministry,” he added. Jake Sullivan said that the US also expects its allies and partners to impose sanctions against Iran. He said that the US continues to work to further strengthen and expand the successful integration of air and missile defence and early warning systems across the Middle East to further erode the effectiveness of Iran’s missile and UAV capabilities. \n             \n           Sullivan said, “We anticipate that our allies and partners will soon be following with their own sanctions. In addition, we continue to work through the Department of Defense and U.S. Central Command to further strengthen and expand the successful integration of air and missile defence and early warning systems across the Middle East to further erode the effectiveness of Iran’s missile and UAV capabilities.” He noted that the new sanctions and other measures will continue a “steady drumbeat of pressure” to contain and degrade Iran’s military capacity and effectiveness and confront the full range of its problematic behaviours. He recalled that the US, in the past three years, in addition to missile and drone-related sanctions, has imposed sanctions against more than 600 individuals and entities connected to terrorism. Jake Sullivan said, “Over the last three years, in addition to missile and drone-related sanctions, the United States has sanctioned over 600 individuals and entities connected to terrorism, terrorist financing and other forms of illicit trade, horrific human rights abuses, and support for proxy terrorist groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Kataib Hezbollah. The pressure will continue. (With Inputs From ANI)",

(AP Photo)   \n         Iran-Israel Crisis :  Jerusalem  has begun a diplomatic onslaught against  Iran  following last weekend’s brazen missile attack by the former against the  Jewish nation .  Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz  Tuesday said he spoken to his counterparts in dozens of friendly nations and wrote letters to 32 countries, seeking sanctions on Iran’s missile projects and “terrorist” tag for Tehran’s elite  Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  (IRGC).  \n             Israel Katz asserted that Jerusalem’s ‘diplomatic offensive’ against Iran will be carried out alongside a proper military response– whatever that may be — to the Iran’s unprecedented attack on Israel on Saturday last. The Israeli foreign Minister said he sent letters to 32 countries and spoke with dozens of foreign ministers and leading figures around the world calling for sanctions to be imposed on the Iranian missile project and its IRGC forces be declared a terrorist organization. “Iran must be stopped now – before it is too late,” said Katz. \n             \n           Israeli reservists carry out combat exercise near Lebanon border Meanwhile, amid the surging tensions with Iran, Israeli reservists Tuesday completed a combat readiness exercise along the Lebanese border on Tuesday. According to the Israel Defence Forces, the exercises included scenarios involving simultaneous fighting in Syria and Lebanon, cyber exercises, and transitioning from routine to a state of emergency. On Monday, IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi indicated Israel would respond to Iran’s missile and drone attack. “We are looking ahead, we are considering our steps, and this launch of so many missiles, cruise missiles, and UAVs into the territory of the State of Israel will be met with a response,” Halevi said. Israel’s War Cabinet met on Monday night to discuss how to respond. According to various media reports, the Cabinet is divided on the timing and scale of Israel’s retaliation. Iran attack on Israel On Saturday night, Iran launched over 320 drones and missiles at Israel. Most of the drones and several cruise missiles were intercepted by the air forces of the US, Jordan, Britain and France without reaching Israel airspace. Israeli air defenses intercepted the remaining missiles. The IDF said 99 percent of the drones and missiles launched by Iran were intercepted, while most of the UAVs were shot down by American, Jordanian, British and French forces, the Arrow-3 shot down the ballistic missiles at high altitudes. A Bedouin girl was injured by falling shrapnel near the Negev town of Arad, and Israel’s Nevatim Air Force base sustained minor damage, according to IDF. Iran’s brazen attack came in response to an alleged Israeli airstrike on an Iranian embassy compound in Damascus on April 1 which killed IRGC Quds Force commander Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, and seven other IRGC officers. Iran had vowed to avenge the strike, however, Israel never confirmed responsibility. (With inputs from agencies)",

        "text": "Israeli Protesters Demand Ceasefire Deal After Six More Captives Killed in Gaza   \n         Tel Aviv:  German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron were in Israel on Wednesday for crisis diplomacy talks. Cameron spoke in favour of a measured response by Israel to Iran’s recent attack. He hopes the country responds “in a way that is smart as well as tough, but it also does as little as possible to escalate this conflict.”  \n             The British Foreign Secretary said it was more important to concentrate on freeing the Israeli hostages, getting aid supplies into the Gaza Strip and achieving a ceasefire there. He added that he planned to discuss this with the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority. Baerbock and Cameron met Israeli President Isaac Herzog and planned to hold further talks with top Israeli officials in a separate but coordinated manner, according to the German Foreign Office. Baerbock also met with Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz during the visit, her seventh since the deadly October 7 attacks on Israel led by the Palestinian militant group Hamas. She is also set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former opposition leader Benny Gantz, who is a member of the Israeli War Cabinet, before leaving Israel later on Wednesday. At the centre of the discussions are fears that the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip could erupt into a major regional war. Iran launched significant air attacks on Israel last Saturday in response to a strike on the Iranian embassy in Damascus. \n             \n           Israeli officials are now vowing a harsh counterattack against Iran. Israel’s allies worry such a response could fuel a spiral of violence and are urging restraint. Baerbock is also likely to address the humanitarian situation of the suffering civilian population in Gaza. In recent weeks, she has repeatedly called on Israel to allow more aid deliveries to the Palestinian territory.",

        "description": "Benjamin Netanyahu vowed at a cabinet meeting that Israel will make its own decisions and do whatever is necessary to protect itself, even if it contradicts the advice given by its allies, as reported by The Times of Israel.",
        "text": "Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has vowed to retaliate against Iran.   \n         Tel Aviv:  Days after the missile attacks by Iran, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country will decide how to respond to Iran’s unprecedented attack as world leaders called for restraint to avoid escalation. In the meantime, the Israeli military has vowed to respond to Iran’s missile and drone weekend attack.  \n             On the other hand, the White House and Brussels have also pledged to ramp up sanctions against Iran, while British Foreign Secretary David Cameron and his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock became the first Western envoys to visit Israel after the attack. Benjamin Netanyahu vowed at a cabinet meeting that Israel will make its own decisions and do whatever is necessary to protect itself, even if it contradicts the advice given by its allies, as reported by The Times of Israel. Netanyahu made the remark at the cabinet meeting on Wednesday after meeting with the foreign ministers of the UK and Germany. Earlier in the day, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock arrived in Israel after Tehran’s attack on the country, on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday, launching around 350 drone and missile strikes. \n             \n           Germany and the UK have called on Israel to exercise restraint after its attack, warning that any additional direct hostilities with Iran could result in all-out war in the Middle East, according to The Times of Israel. However, Israel has vowed to retaliate against Iran, saying that it cannot be allowed to attack without facing repercussions. In his remarks at the cabinet meeting, Netanyahu said that the two leaders had “all kinds of suggestions and advice.” He noted that while it was appreciated, Israel would nevertheless “make our own decisions, and Israel will do everything necessary to defend itself.” Speaking to reporters in Israel, David Cameron said that it was clear there would be retaliation against Israel. However, he expressed hope that it is carried out in a “way that is smart as well as tough and also does as little as possible to escalate this conflict.” Meanwhile, Annalena Baerbock expressed her opposition to Israel’s plan to retaliate against Iran. However, she added that Germany remains in full solidarity with Israel, as The Times of Israel reported. Baerbock said, “Iran and its proxies, such as Hezbollah or the Houthis, must not be allowed to add fuel to the fire,” adding that there would be consequences to Iran’s strike as the European Union was working on imposing further sanctions against Tehran, according to The Times of Israel report.",

        "description": "The MSC Aries, an Israel-linked cargo ship, was seized by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy near the Strait of Hormuz on April 13, with 17 Indian nationals onboard.",
        "text": "EAM Dr S Jaishankar   \n         New Delhi:  In a testament to the Indian government’s commitment to its citizens’ well-being, Ann Tessa Joseph, one of the 17 Indian crew members aboard the Israel-linked cargo ship ‘MSC Aries’ seized by Iran on April 13, has returned home safely. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar commended the Indian Embassy in Iran for their tireless efforts in securing her release, emphasising that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s guarantee always delivers, both on the domestic and international fronts.  \n             Kerala Native Reunited with Family Ann Tessa Joseph, a native of Thrissur, Kerala, arrived at Cochin International Airport on Thursday afternoon, where she was warmly received by the Regional Passport Officer. Her safe return was made possible through the concerted efforts of the Indian Mission in Tehran and the Iranian government, as stated by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). Remaining Crew Members in Good Health The Indian Mission in Tehran remains in constant contact with the remaining 16 Indian crew members, who are reported to be in good health and in touch with their families back home. The MEA assured that the mission is working closely with Iranian authorities to ensure the well-being of the remaining crew members and to facilitate their safe return. Diplomatic Efforts Pave the Way External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had earlier spoken to his Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Amir Abdollahian, regarding the matter. The Indian Embassy in Iran, with the support of Iranian authorities, played a crucial role in facilitating Ann Tessa Joseph’s return, as confirmed by MEA official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal. \n             \n           The MSC Aries Seizure The MSC Aries, an Israel-linked cargo ship, was seized by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy near the Strait of Hormuz on April 13, with 17 Indian nationals onboard. The incident raised concerns about the safety and well-being of the Indian crew members, prompting swift action from the Indian government. The seizure of the ship is believed to be linked to ongoing tensions between Iran and Israel, with the Islamic Republic having a history of targeting Israel-linked vessels in the region. The Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway between Iran and Oman, is a critical shipping route for global oil supplies, making it a strategic and sensitive location for international trade. Modi Government’s Commitment to Citizens’ Safety The safe return of Ann Tessa Joseph and the ongoing efforts to ensure the well-being of the remaining crew members highlight the Modi government’s unwavering commitment to the safety and security of Indian citizens, both at home and abroad. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s praise for the Indian Embassy in Iran and his emphasis on Prime Minister Modi’s guarantee underscore the government’s proactive approach to protecting its citizens’ interests in challenging situations. As the Indian Mission in Tehran continues to work towards the safe return of the remaining crew members, the incident serves as a reminder of the complex geopolitical challenges that can impact the lives of individuals caught in the crosshairs of international tensions. The Indian government’s successful handling of the situation thus far demonstrates its resolve to navigate such challenges effectively while prioritizing the safety and well-being of its citizens.",

        "text": "Google is offering a 'Summer Special' for employees to stay the night at an on-campus hotel for a discount. (Image: IANS)   \n         New York:  Google said on Thursday it had terminated 28 employees after some staff participated in protests against the company’s cloud contract with the Israeli government. The Alphabet unit said a small number of protesting employees entered and disrupted work at a few unspecified office locations.  \n             “Physically impeding other employees’ work and preventing them from accessing our facilities is a clear violation of our policies, and completely unacceptable behavior,” the company said in a statement. Google said it had concluded individual investigations, resulting in the termination of 28 employees, and would continue to investigate and take action as needed. In a statement on Medium, Google workers affiliated with the No Tech for Apartheid campaign called it a “flagrant act of retaliation” and said that some employees who did not directly participate in Tuesday’s protests were also among those Google fired. \n             \n           “Google workers have the right to peacefully protest about the terms and conditions of our labor,” the statement added. The protesting faction says that Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion contract awarded to Google and Amazon.com in 2021 to supply the Israeli government with cloud services, supports the development of military tools by the Israeli government. In its statement, Google maintained that the Nimbus contract “is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.” Protests at Google are not new. In 2018, workers successfully pushed the company to shelve a contract with the US military, Project Maven, meant to analyze aerial drone imagery with potential application in warfare.",

        "text": "Breaking News Highlights , April 18:   A Delhi court on Thursday extended AAP leader and former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s judicial custody till April 26 in connection with a money laundering case related to the alleged excise policy scam. Sisodia was produced before Special Judge Kaveri Baweja of Rouse Avenue Court on the expiry of his previously extended judicial custody. On Monday, the court said that it will continue hearing the AAP leader’s bail application on April 20. Judge Baweja had heard the arguments of Sisodia’s counsel, and the counsel appearing for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Earlier, the ED had accused Sisodia and the other accused persons of delaying the trial in the case. Sisodia’s bail application was filed by his counsel Mohit Mathur alleging delay in completing the probe into the case, claiming that no evidence has been found linking his client to the alleged bribe money.  \n             .liveblog-entry{border-top:none !important; \n                 Live Updates     \t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t \r\n\t{\r\n\t  \"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\r\n\t

        "description": "Breaking News: Israel Launches Massive Missile Attack On Iran, Explosions Heard At Airport",
        "text": "Iran Israel War   \n         Tel Aviv:  In retaliatory attack, Israeli launched missile attacks on Iran, ABC News reported, citing a US official, days after Iran launched a drone strike on Israel in response to an attack at the Iranian embassy in Syria.  \n             Iran’s Fars news agency said an explosion were heard at an airport in the Iranian city of Isafahan but the cause was not immediately known. Several Iranian nuclear sites are located in Isfahan province, including Natanz, centerpiece of Iran’s uranium enrichment program. Several flights were diverted over Iranian airspace and the commercial flights started rerouting their paths over western Iran early on Friday without clarification, according to the Associated Press. The development comes soon after Iran’s Foreign Minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, warned Israel against taking any military actions targeting Iranian interests. He stated Iran has concluded its “defense and counteroffensive measures” and urged the international community to stop Israel from carrying out any military operations against Iran. During discussions on the Middle East situation at the UNSC, Amir-Abdollahian said, “Iran’s legitimate defense and countermeasures have been concluded. Therefore, the Israeli regime must be compelled to stop any further military adventurism against our centres, assets and interests. Certainly, in case of any illegal use of force by the Israeli regime and violating our sovereignty, the Islamic Republic of Iran will not hesitate a bit to assert its inherent right to give a decisive and proper response to it to make the regime regret its actions.” \n             \n           He accused Israel of carrying out a missile attack on Iranian diplomatic premises in Damascus on April 1. He said that Israel’s action was a “clear violation of the Charter of the United Nations international law and the Vienna Convention.” He said, “The missile attack on the 1st of April on the Iranian diplomatic premises in Damascus showed yet again that this regime does not hesitate to violate the fundamental principle of the immunity of such places and people as well as the known and well recognised Vienna Conventions. As the majority of the members of the Security Council declared at the April 2 meeting here, the attack was a clear violation of the Charter of the United Nations international law and the Vienna Convention, and thus is strongly condemned.” He criticised the US, UK, and France for not issuing a statement over the attack on the Iranian diplomatic premises in Damascus. He even expressed regret that the UNSC did not take action on Iran’s repeated requests to prevent further attacks by Israel on Iran’s interests. He accused the White House of giving a green signal to Israel’s action. He said, “Regrettably, the Security Council, had not taken any action during the past months to our official and repeated requests to prevent further attacks by the Israeli regime on Iran’s interests, centres and official military advisors who were there to fight terrorism and due to the unfortunate and completely irresponsible behaviour of the United States, the UK and France, in response to this illegal attack, failed even to issue a mere statement containing a simple condemnation.” “No will remain silent in the face of such a brazen and serious military attack on its Embassy, which is considered a symbol of its sovereignty, as well as the killing of its legal, official and diplomatic agents. The Islamic Republic of Iran, which until recently had shown considerable restraint against other terrorist missile attacks bearing in mind the dire situation in the region and willing to give the role of the United Nations a chance to prevent the escalation of the conflict, was faced with the continuation of the White House’s green light granted to the Israeli regime as well as the continued inaction of the Security Council in preventing the attacks by the Israeli regime,” he added. Justifying Iran’s attack on Israel, he said, “Iran’s military attack on April 13th, was first and foremost, necessary because Iran had no other option. Secondly, it was carried out in response to a series of attacks and recurring aggressions by the Israeli regime on Iran’s interests, especially on our Embassy in Syria.”",

        "description": "Isfahan holds significant importance for Iran, housing a major airbase for the Iranian military and sites linked to its nuclear program.",
        "text": "Iran Israel War   \n         Israel-Iran War Updates:  Iran’s air defenses were reportedly fired on Friday after explosions were heard near a major base in the city of Isfahan, raising concerns about a potential attack on the country. However, it remained unclear whether Iran was indeed under attack, as an Iranian official attributed the explosions to the activation of the country’s air defense systems. The official clarified that no missile attack had been launched within Iranian territory, as reported by Reuters. Senior commander of Iran’s Army, Siavosh Mihandoust, confirmed that the blast did not result in any damage. Isfahan province, where the base is located, is home to several of Iran’s crucial nuclear sites, including Natanz, which serves as the centerpiece of the nation’s uranium enrichment program.  \n             Following the incident, airlines adjusted their flight paths over Iran, either diverting to alternate airports or returning to their departure sites due to the closure of Iranian airspace. However, by 0445 GMT, the airports and airspace had reopened, with closure notices removed from the US Federal Aviation Administration database. The recent escalation comes in the wake of Tehran’s launch of over 300 drones and missiles towards Israeli territory on April 14 in retaliation for an Israeli attack on an Iranian consulate in Damascus on April 1. The earlier attack led to the tragic deaths of at least 13 individuals, including two prominent members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, further heightening tensions in the region. .liveblog-entry{border-top:none !important; \n                 Live Updates     \t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t \r\n\t{\r\n\t  \"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\r\n\t  \"@type\":\"LiveBlogPosting\",\r\n\t  \"@id\":\"https://www.india.com/news/world/iran-israel-war-live-updates-april-19-latest-news-israel-fires-missile-explosions-heard-near-isfahan-airport-flights-diverted-6870197/\",\r\n\t  \"author\": {\r\n\t\t\"@type\": \"Person\",\r\n\t\t\"name\": \"Analiza Pathak\"\r\n\t  ,\r\n\t  \"datePublished\":\"2024-04-19T08:58:24+05:30\",\r\n\t  \"dateModified\": \"2024-04-19T12:28:30+05:30\",\r\n\t  \"coverageStartTime\":\"2024-04-19T08:57:29+05:30\",\r\n\t  \"coverageEndTime\":\"2025-01-10T23:59:59+05:30\",\r\n\t  \"headline\":\"Iran-Israel War: &#8216;There Was No Missile Attack, Says Iranian Official; Tehran Airports Resume Flights\",\r\n\t  \"description\":\"Isfahan holds significant importance for Iran, housing a major airbase for the Iranian military and sites linked to its nuclear program.\",\r\n\t  \"about\":{\r\n\t\t\"@type\":\"Event\",\r\n\t\t\"startDate\":\"2024-04-19T08:57:29+05:30\",\r\n\t\t\"name\":\"Iran-Israel War: &#8216;There Was No Missile Attack, Says Iranian Official; Tehran Airports Resume Flights\",\r\n\t\t\"description\":\"Isfahan holds significant importance for Iran, housing a major airbase for the Iranian military and sites linked to its nuclear program.\",\r\n\t\t\"eventAttendanceMode\":\"https://schema.org/MixedEventAttendanceMode\",\r\n\t\t\"eventStatus\":\"Live\",\r\n\t\t\"image\":\"https://static.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Iran-Israel-War.jpg\",\r\n\t\t\"endDate\":\"2025-01-10T23:59:59+05:30\",\r\n\t\t\"location\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"@type\":\"Place\",\r\n\t\t\t\"name\":\"New Delhi\",\r\n\t\t\t\"address\":\"India Webportal Pvt Ltd,Marathon Futurex,20th Floor,NM Joshi Marg,Lower Parel East,Mumbai-400013, Maharashtra, India\"\r\n\t\t ,\r\n\t\t \"performer\": {\r\n\t\t  \"@type\": \"PerformingGroup\",\r\n\t\t  \"name\": \"Iran-Israel War: &#8216;There Was No Missile Attack, Says Iranian Official; Tehran Airports Resume Flights\"\r\n\t\t,\r\n\t\t\"organizer\": {\r\n\t\t  \"@type\": \"Organization\",\r\n\t\t  \"name\": \"Iran-Israel War: &#8216;There Was No Missile Attack, Says Iranian Official; Tehran Airports Resume Flights\",\r\n\t\t  \"url\": \"https://www.india.com/news/world/iran-israel-war-live-updates-april-19-latest-news-israel-fires-missile-explosions-heard-near-isfahan-airport-flights-diverted-6870197/\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t   ,\r\n\t  \"liveBlogUpdate\":[\r\n\t\t[{\"@type\":\"BlogPosting\",\"articleBody\":\"IAEA confirms no damage made to Iran&#039;s nuclear sites in Israel&#039;s attack\\n\\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Friday there was no damage to Iran&#039;s nuclear sites in an alleged attack by Israel on Iran.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)   \n         Washington:  The House is pushing swiftly through a series of votes in a rare Saturday session to approve $95 billion in foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies, Democrats and Republicans joining together after a grueling monthslong fight over renewed American support for repelling Russia’s invasion.  \n             With overwhelming support, the House approved the Ukraine portion, a $61 billion aid package, in a strong showing of American backing as lawmakers race to deliver a fresh round of U.S. support to the war-torn ally. Some lawmakers cheered, waiving blue-and-yellow flags of Ukraine. The $26 billion package aiding Israel and providing humanitarian relief to citizens of Gaza also easily cleared. Each segment of the aid package faced an up-or-down vote. A national security bill that includes a provision forcing sale of the popular platform TikTok was quickly approved, as was another supporting Indo-Pacific allies. The unusual process is allowing unique coalitions to form around the bills, pushing them forward. The whole package will go to the Senate, where passage in the coming days is nearly assured. President Joe Biden has promised to sign it immediately. \n             \n           “The eyes of the world are upon us, and history will judge what we do here and now,” said Rep.

        "text": "People walk amid rubble after an Israeli raid at Nur Shams camp, Tulkarm, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, April 20, 2024. (REUTERS)   \n         Israel-Hamas War:  The  Israel Defence Forces (IDF)  have killed at least 14 civilians during a military operation at the  Nur al-Shams refugee camp  in the  West Bank , the  Palestinian Ministry of Health  has said. According to a CNN report, the ministry said they have found a number of bodies and injured people from the refugee camp even as the IDF has partially withdrawn from the area.  \n             On Saturday, the IDF claimed to have killed “terrorists and arrested eight wanted suspects” during the operation that began on Thursday, CNN reported. The Palestinian Health Ministry said at least one child and one teenager were among those killed by Israeli forces who also arrested young people en masse and destroyed key infrastructure. The ministry also condemned two separate incidents of attacks on emergency medical crews operating in the West Bank on Saturday. Palestinian ambulance driver shot dead by Israeli settlers The ministry, citing the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), said an ambulance driver was killed by Israeli settlers as he attempted to take injured Palestinians to safety while another ambulance crew was detained and questioned by the IDF outside a hospital in the West Bank. \n             \n           It said that the driver, Mohammed Awad Allah Mohammed Musa (50), was working with the PRCS and was shot dead by the Israeli settlers who opened fire on his ambulance. “The Ministry urgently calls on international health organisations, human rights institutions, and the International Committee of the Red Cross to urgently act to curb the escalating practices of the occupation and settlers against treatment centers and medical crews and to allow them to perform their humanitarian duty,” the ministry said in a statement. ‘Blatant violation of humanitarian laws’ The Palestinian Ministry of Health called the targeting of medics, ambulances, and medical staff a “blatant and clear violation of international humanitarian law. “The targeting of medics, ambulances, treatment centres, and medical staff, obstructing their movement, and preventing them from reaching the wounded, constitutes a blatant and clear violation of international humanitarian law and international norms and treaties,” the ministry said. IDF claims “terrorists” killed in West Bank operation On Friday, the Israeli military said that several Palestinian gunmen were killed and four soldiers were wounded during a counter-terrorism raid in the West Bank’s Nur al-Shams refugee camp, close to Tulkarem, The Times of Israel reported. The IDF said its troops and Border Police officers conducted a raid at Nur Shams overnight, during which several wanted Palestinians were detained, explosive devices were discovered, and several gunmen were killed in clashes throughout the morning. Meanwhile, videos shot by residents at the West Bank refugee camp showed a bulldozer destroying a building as IDF vehicles leave the camp after conducting a raid for over 24 hours. Other videos showcase ambulances entering the camp after the IDF withdraws from there. They said that Israeli forces have left the immediate area. However, they continue to remain present in the nearby city of Tulkarm. (With inputs from agencies)",

        "description": "The US House of Representatives approved a $95.3 billion foreign-aid package for Ukraine, Israel, and other American allies on Saturday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked US lawmakers for passing the bill.",
        "text": "File Photo   \n         Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelenskyy  and Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  thanked lawmakers in the  US   House of Representatives  for voting in a favour of a generous $95.3 billion aid package for  Israel  and  Ukraine  to the help finance the ongoing war-efforts in their respective countries.  \n             The House of Representatives approved a $95.3 billion foreign-aid package for Ukraine, Israel, and other American allies on Saturday. Lawmakers approved the package, most of which is direct military assistance, in separate votes. ‘Thank You America’ Following the announcement, Zelenskyy thanked the US lawmakers for a deciding to “keep history on the right track”. “I am grateful to the United States House of Representatives, both parties, and personally Speaker Mike Johnson for the decision that keeps history on the right track. Democracy and freedom will always have global significance and will never fail as long as America helps to protect it,” Zelenskyy said in a post on X. \n             \n           “The vital US aid bill passed today by the House will keep the war from expanding, save thousands and thousands of lives, and help both of our nations to become stronger. Just peace and security can only be attained through strength. We hope that bills will be supported in the Senate and sent to President Biden’s desk. Thank you, America!,” the Ukrainian President added. In another post, Zelenskyy called the US aid package for Ukraine a “significant” decision and noted that America has demonstrated its leadership since the war between Russia and Ukraine started. He asserted that this type of leadership is required to maintain a “rules-based international order and predictability for all nations.” “I am hopeful that the bill will be quite quickly passed by the United States Senate and sent to President Biden. We appreciate every sign of support for our country and its independence, people, and way of life, which Russia is attempting to bury under the rubble,” Zelenskyy said. “America has demonstrated its leadership since the first days of this war. Exactly this type of leadership is required to maintain a rules-based international order and predictability for all nations.” US aid will help bring ‘just end’ to Russia-Ukraine war Zelenskyy asserted that Ukraine will use US assistance to bring a “just end” to this war closer and thanked everyone who helped bring this outcome to fruition. “I thank our entire Ukrainian team and everyone who works tirelessly to bring this outcome closer. I am grateful to all of our country’s representatives, diplomats working to strengthen support for Ukraine, all civil society members, every volunteer who works for Ukraine, and all of Ukraine’s friends around the world. I thank my team. The world rallies behind Ukraine’s cause when Ukrainians rally behind independence.” The bill passed by the US House provides USD 60.8 billion for Ukraine, with over 80 per cent of it for helping Kyiv amid its ongoing war with Russia, including replenishing supplies of US made weapons and ammunition. Around USD 9.5 billion of the package is in the form of a forgivable loan.The bill was passed 311-112, with Republicans voting against it. Many Democrats celebrated the passage of the bill and waved Ukraine flags while shouting “Ukraine.” Of the 218 House Republican lawmakers, 112 voted against the bill, according to New York Post report. US House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, who supported the bill, warned that it is a “violation” of the House to wave flags on the floor. ‘Strong bipartisan support’ for Israel Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also thanked US House for passing the aid bill and stressed that the decision showcases “strong bipartisan support” for Israel. “The US Congress just overwhelmingly passed a much appreciated aid bill that demonstrates strong bipartisan support for Israel and defends Western civilization. Thank you friends, thank you America!,” Netanyahu posted on X. The US House approved bill which provides roughly $17 billion in direct military aid for Israel and more than $9 billion in humanitarian aid for Gaza and other war-torn regions. The bill was passed 366-58 with dissenting members including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other “Squad” members and Representative Bob Good Freedom Caucus members, New York Post reported. The passage of the aid package bill for Israel in the US House comes amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas. (With inputs from agencies)",

        "description": "The State Department declined comment beyond remarks made on Friday by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.",
        "text": "Jerusalem:  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday he would fight against sanctions being imposed on any Israeli military units for alleged rights violations, after media reports said Washington was planning such a step.  \n             The Axios news site reported on Saturday that Washington was planning to impose sanctions on Israel’s Netzah Yehuda battalion, which has operated in the occupied West Bank, though the Israeli military said it was not aware of any such measures. On Friday, the United States announced a new series of sanctions linked to Israeli settlers in the West Bank, in the latest sign of growing U.S. fr us tration with the policies of Netanyahu, whose coalition government relies on settler parties. “If anyone thinks they can impose sanctions on a unit of the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) – I will fight it with all my strength,” Netanyahu said in a statement. \n             \n           The State Department declined comment beyond remarks made on Friday by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Blinken said he had made “determinations” regarding acc us ations that Israel violated a set of U.S. laws that prohibit providing military assistance to individuals or security force units that commit gross violations of human rights. Earlier this week, the Pro Publica investigative news organization reported that a special State Department panel known as the Israel Leahy Vetting Forum had recommended months ago to Blinken that multiple Israeli military and police units be disqualified from receiving U.S. aid, after allegations of human rights violations. The incidents that were the subject of allegations took place in the West Bank and mostly occurred before Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza began on Oct. 7, the outlet said. Before the Gaza war, violence had already been on the rise in the West Bank, land that the Palestinians seek for a state, and it has risen since with frequent Israeli raids, Palestinian street attacks and settler rampages in Palestinian villages. The Israeli military said the Netzah Yehuda battalion is an active combat unit that operates according to the principles of international law. “Following publications about sanctions against the battalion, the IDF is not aware of the issue,” the military said. “If a decision is made on the matter, it will be reviewed. The IDF works and will continue to work to investigate any un us ual event in a practical manner and according to the law. In 2022, Netzah Yehuda’s battalion commander was reprimanded and two officers were dismissed over the death of an elderly Palestinian-American whom the unit’s soldiers had detained in the West Bank, an incident that stirred concern in Washington. There have been several other incidents in recent years, some captured on video, in which Netzah Yehuda soldiers were acc us ed of or charged with ab us ing Palestinian detainees.

        "description": "The Israel Hamas War has been going on for the last six months and thousands of lives have been lost on both sides. It seems that finally the war and bloodshed may come to an end as the Israeli War Cabinet meet late at night to discuss release of hostages.",
        "text": "New Delhi:  On October 6, 2023 the terrorist organisation  Hamas  fired 5000 rockets from the conflicted  Gaza Strip  on  Israel , converting the decades-old  Israel Palestine Conflict  into the deadly,  Israel Hamas War . Ever since, both countries have been at war and have unfortunately not stopped, despite the constant loss of life and property in both nations. Thousands of people including women and children have lost their lives, the worlds of these countries have stopped, hospitals etc. are running on low or no supplies at all – the condition is extremely disturbing and sad. While there have been a few ceasefires, the nations are not ready to back down from war. However, it now seems that finally the  Israel-Hamas War  may come to and end as the  Israeli War Cabinet  meets late at night to discuss the release of the remaining hostages…  \n             Israeli War Cabinet Conducts Late Night Meeting As mentioned earlier, the Israeli war cabinet held a meeting late Sunday (local time) to discuss efforts for the release of remaining hostages held in Gaza, CNN reported, citing an Israeli official. The war cabinet has four members – Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s Minister of Defence Yoav Gallant, and National Unity Party chairman Benny Gantz. In a video statement, released by the Israel government’s press office to mark Passover on Sunday, Netanyahu said, “This night, 133 of our dear brothers and sisters do not sit at the Seder table and are still imprisoned in the hell of Hamas.” Israel-Hamas War Ending? Unfortunately, this is not the end of the Israel-Hamas War as PM Netanyahu is speaking of the release of their country’s hostages. He accused Hamas of rejecting proposals for a hostage deal “outright.” He announced that Israel will soon land “additional and painful blows” and will increase “military and political pressure” on Hamas to release the hostages, according to CNN report. For weeks, international mediators have facilitated talks on a ceasefire and hostage deal. However, the talks have yielded no apparent breakthroughs. Israel Hamas War Ceasefire Deals Unsuccessful Earlier this month, Hamas indicated that it was not able to identify and track down 40 Israeli hostages needed for the first phase of a ceasefire deal, CNN reported, citing Israeli official and a source familiar with the discussions. According to the framework outlined by the negotiators, Hamas should release 40 of the remaining hostages, including all the women as well as sick and elderly men during a first six-week pause in the fighting. In exchange, Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, the report said. \n             \n           Despite the ceasefire attempts by other nations, the countries are still fighting each other; recently, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) conducted a two-day operation in the Nur al-Shams Refugee Camp which is near the Tulkarm in the West Bank. At least 14 people which included a child, were killed in this operation; IDF called it ‘extensive counterterrorism’ and said that 10 ‘terrorists’ were killed and ‘eight wanted suspects were arrested’ in the operation.

The attack triggered a war that has been raging for the last six months and neither of the two countries are ready to back down. The war has resulted in the killing of thousands of people on both sides, people have been tortured and held hostage, there has been sexual violence and the basic human rights of the people of both countries have been abused in ways more than one. Now, the  United States  has released its  Country Reports on Human Rights Practices  which is released every year and they have highlighted how Israel has abused human rights in Gaza; US has also mentioned how both countries are equally responsible for the  human rights abuses  in the war..  \n             ‘Israel Hamas War Continues To Raise Deeply Troubling Concerns For Human Rights’ As mentioned earlier, the US State Department released its annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and highlighted Israel, underscoring concerns over human rights abuses in Gaza. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken addressed the human rights concerns stating, “The conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza continues to raise deeply troubling concerns for human rights.” The resulting conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip has had a “significant negative impact” on the human rights status in Israel, the report said. US Presents ‘Credible Reports’ Of Israeli Human Right Abuses In Gaza The US Secretary of State has also added that the US has condemned the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks while urging Israel to minimize civilian harm in its response. The section on Israel, which runs 103 pages, documents “credible reports” of more than a dozen types of human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary detention, conflict-related sexual violence or punishment, and the punishment of family members for alleged offences by a relative. It further cited credible reports of “unlawful killings” by both Hamas and the Israeli government. Blinken in his remarks, explained that the US has “made clear” that Israel needs to follow international law “and take every feasible precaution to protect civilians.” He emphasized that the department is still “urgently” raising concerns about civilian deaths in Gaza during the war. The US also “repeatedly” brought up concerns about humanitarian aid access in Gaza, civilian displacement and “unprecedented” journalist deaths, the report noted. \n             \n           Recently, the Israeli War Cabinet, which included Israel PM Netanyahu, held a meeting to discuss the release of their remaining hostages. While a lot of nations have been trying to get a ceasefire situation between the warring nations but Israel has made it clear that they aren’t done yet and that they will give “additional and painful blows” and will increase “military and political pressure” on the terrorist organisation to make sure that Israel’s hostages are released.

        "text": "Heatwave hits Israel.    \n         Koraput:  With day temperatures in Malkangiri and Nabarangpur districts of Odisha hovering between 39 and 42 degrees Celsius, political parties are focusing more on evening meetings and small village gatherings while campaigning for the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections.  \n             Malkangiri district under Nabarangpur Lok Sabha seat recorded the highest temperature of 42 degrees Celsius recently. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast more heatwaves in the next few days in the state. Odisha’s Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Nikunj B Dhal has suggested that political parties and candidates undertake election campaigning with adequate measures to beat the heat. BJP candidate for Nabarangpur Lok Sabha seat Balabhadra Majhi said, “I had prepared a chart for my campaigning soon after the declaration of the tickets but altered my campaigning itinerary due to the scorching temperature, focusing more on evening meetings and small village gatherings.” \n             \n           Pradeep Majhi, BJD candidate for the Nabarangpur Lok Sabha seat acknowledged that heatwave has caused disruption in his election campaign but was optimistic about overcoming these challenges before the election date. Many candidates, including Kaliram Majhi, BJP’s candidate for the Koraput Lok Sabha seat, emphasized the shift towards indoor campaigning due to the unbearable heat, limiting outdoor rallies and roadshows. “We are unable to take out roadshows and rallies because of the prevailing heat. Hence, I prefer indoor campaigning to outdoor meetings,” said Tara Prasad Bahinipati, the Congress candidate for the Jeypore assembly seat under Koraput Lok Sabha seat. The incumbent Koraput MP and Congress candidate for the Koraput Lok Sabha seat Saptagiri Sankar Ulaka highlighted the importance of staying hydrated and taking afternoon breaks to combat the heat during campaigning. “Though I have planned for a few rallies in urban areas, seeing the heatwave has temporarily halted it. Presently, I am focusing on indoor meetings with the people of my constituency,” said Ulaka. On Monday BJD Puri Lok Sabha constituency candidate Arup Patnaik was rushed to hospital after he fell down during campaigning near Pipili town in Puri district due to heatwave conditions.

        "description": "Jaishankar stressed the importance of having a clear national identity and purpose, steering away from ambiguous ideologies that may hinder the country's progress on the global stage.",
        "text": "Minister of External Affairs of India, Dr S. Jaishankar.   \n         New Delhi:  External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar highlighted a significant shift in India’s policy approach, moving away from past influences of ‘faith’ and ‘vote bank’ towards a more pragmatic and strategic decision-making process. Speaking at the ‘Foreign Policy The India Way’ event in Hyderabad, Jaishankar emphasized that several decisions taken in the early years post-independence had long-term repercussions for the nation. Jaishankar underscored the transition from an era of diffidence to a period of clarity and confidence in India’s foreign policy. He stressed the importance of having a clear national identity and purpose, steering away from ambiguous ideologies that may hinder the country’s progress on the global stage. “When we say an era of diffidence, it is not just an era of diffidence, it’s an era where we don’t have clarity, our nationalities. We somewhere, mixed a certain ideological outlook…what could be our contribution to the world,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.  \n             Upholding National Interest The minister reiterated the principle of ‘India First’ and ‘Bharat First’, emphasizing that while India contributes to the world, it should never come at the expense of compromising national interests. He highlighted the concept of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, signifying global unity while safeguarding India’s sovereignty. “We also do many things for the world but that cannot be at the cost of our national interest. That’s why ‘India First’, ‘Bharat First’ and ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ are two sides of the same coin, but we should never allow Bharat First to be compromised,” he added. Strategic Relations with Israel Jaishankar cited the evolution of India-Israel relations, noting that India established its embassy in Israel only in 1992, and Prime Minister Modi’s visit marked a significant milestone. He also addressed how past policies influenced by ‘vote bank’ considerations impacted India’s diplomatic stance. “Just think of a country like Israel. People say everybody is the same, we should not bring faith in any discussion. Israel became independent in 1948. From 1948 to 1992, we chose not to have an ambassador and an embassy in Israel. Why? From 1992, we had an embassy. From 1992 till 2017, when Narendra Modi went to Israel, no prime minister of India ever visited Israel. Think about it and then tell me that faith does not influence our policy. Is this not vote bank?” Jaishankar further asserted. \n             \n           Importance of Abrogation of Article 370 Emphasising the importance of abrogation of Article 370, Jaishankar highlighted the creation of a ‘vote bank lobby’ by Indian leadership to maintain the special provision in the former state. Stressing its temporary nature, Jaishankar asserts the necessity of its termination. Describing it as a correction of a significant error made in 1947, he points out the formation of various lobbies, including a Kashmiri lobby. “Please understand the importance of what we did with the abrogation of Article 370. We have corrected an enormous mistake, we made in 1947. We created a lobby, we created a vote bank lobby, we created a Kashmiri lobby, some people were arbitraging,” the Foreign Minister said. Citizenship Amendment Act Speaking on the issue of the Citizenship Amendment Act, without naming it, he said that after the number of Hindus, Sikhs and other minorities plummeted since partition, India is trying to give citizenship to those people who have nowhere else to go. “Partition has happened, you can see the violence that has happened and yet we agree with Pakistan that you will treat your minorities well and I will treat my minorities well. If they had treated the minorities well, there would have been no partition. He went to partition with the mindset of not treating the minority well,” Jaishankar said.",

        "description": "TikTok is set to challenge the bill on First Amendment grounds and TikTok users are also expected to take legal action again.",
        "text": "Joe Biden said that he would not cut off weapons like the Iron Dome missile interceptors, which are crucial for protecting Israeli civilians from rocket attacks.   \n         Washington, DC:  The U.S. Senate voted by a wide margin late Tuesday in favor of legislation that would ban TikTok in the United States if its owner, the Chinese tech firm ByteDance, fails to divest the popular short video app over the next nine months to a year.  \n             Driven by widespread worries among U.S. lawmakers that China could access Americans’ data or surveil them with the app, the bill was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on Saturday and U.S. President Joe Biden has said he will sign it into law on Wednesday. “For years we’ve allowed the Chinese Communist Party to control one of the most popular apps in America that was dangerously shortsighted,” said Senator Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee. “A new law is going to require its Chinese owner to sell the app. This is a good move for America.” Asked about the Senate’s vote, the Chinese foreign ministry referred on Wednesday to comments the ministry made in March when the House of Representatives passed a similar bill. \n             \n           At the time, the ministry criticized the legislation, arguing that “though the U.S. has never found any evidence of TikTok posing a threat to the U.S.’s national security, it has never stopped going after TikTok.” The four-year battle over TikTok, which is used by 170 million people in the United States, is just one front in a war over the internet and technology between Washington and Beijing. Last week, Apple said Beijing had ordered it to remove Meta Platforms’ WhatsApp and Threads from its App Store in China over Chinese national security concerns. TikTok is set to challenge the bill on First Amendment grounds and TikTok users are also expected to take legal action again. A U.S. judge in Montana in November blocked a state ban on TikTok, citing free speech grounds. The American Civil Liberties Union said banning or requiring divestiture of TikTok would “set an alarming global precedent for excessive government control over social media platforms. …If the United States now bans a foreign-owned platform, that will invite copycat measures by other countries.” TikTok, which says it has not shared and would not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government, did not immediately comment but has told employees it would quickly go to court to try to block the legislation. “This is the beginning, not the end of this long process,” TikTok told staff on Saturday in an email seen by Reuters. The Senate voted 79 to 18 in favor of the bill, which was attached to a measure to provide $95 billion in mostly military aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. The TikTok divestment directive won fast-track approval after being introduced just weeks ago. In 2020, then-President Donald Trump was blocked by the courts in his bid to block TikTok and Chinese-owned WeChat, a unit of Tencent, in the United States. However, the new legislation is likely to give the Biden administration a stronger legal footing to ban TikTok if ByteDance fails to divest the app, experts say. If ByteDance failed to divest TikTok, app stores operated by Apple, Alphabet’s Google and others could not legally offer TikTok or provide web hosting services to ByteDance-controlled applications or TikTok’s website. The bill would also give the White House new tools to ban or force the sale of other foreign-owned apps it deems to be security threats. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden said he was concerned the bill “provides broad authority that could be abused by a future administration to violate Americans’ First Amendment rights.” Once the bill is signed into law, ByteDance will have 270 days to divest TikTok’s U.S. operations with a possible three-month extension if there are signs a deal is progressing. Democratic Senator Ed Markey said it would be hard, if not impossible, for ByteDance to divest by early 2025, adding that a sale would be one of the most complicated and expensive transactions in history, requiring months if not years of due diligence. “We should be very clear about the likely outcome of this law. It’s really just a TikTok ban,” he said. “Censorship is not who we are as a people. We should not downplay or deny this trade-off.” The bill could also be an issue in the November presidential campaign, with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump urging young voters to consider a possible TikTok ban.",

U.S. officials say Ukraine for the first time has begun using long-range ballistic missiles, striking a Russian military airfield in Crimea and Russian troops in another occupied area overnight. The strikes come about a month after the U.S. secretly provided the weapons so that Ukraine could strike targets up to 190 miles away. (John Hamilton/U.S. Army via AP, file)   \n         Washington:  Ukraine for the first time has begun using long-range ballistic missiles provided secretly by the United States, bombing a Russian military airfield in Crimea last week and Russian forces in another occupied area overnight, American officials said Wednesday.  \n             Long sought by Ukrainian leaders, the new missiles give Ukraine nearly double the striking distance — up to 300 kilometers (190 miles) — that it had with the mid-range version of the weapon that it received from the U.S. last October. One of the officials said the U.S. is providing more of these missiles in a new military aid package signed by President Joe Biden on Wednesday. Biden approved delivery of the long-range Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, in February, and then in March the U.S. included a “significant” number of them in a $300 million aid package announced, one official said. The two U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the delivery before it became public, would not provide the exact number of missiles given last month or in the latest aid package, which totals about $1 billion. \n             \n           Ukraine has been forced to ration its weapons and is facing increasing Russian attacks. Ukraine had been begging for the long-range system because the missiles provide a critical ability to strike Russian targets that are farther away, allowing Ukrainian forces to stay safely out of range. Information about the delivery was kept so quiet that lawmakers and others in recent days have been demanding that the U.S. send the weapons — not knowing they were already in Ukraine. For months, the U.S. resisted sending Ukraine the long-range missiles out of concern that Kyiv could use them to hit deep into Russian territory, enraging Moscow and escalating the conflict. That was a key reason the administration sent the mid-range version, with a range of about 160 kilometers (roughly 100 miles), in October instead. Adm. Christopher Grady, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday that the White House and military planners looked carefully at the risks of providing long-range fires to Ukraine and determined that the time was right to provide them now. He told The Associated Press in an interview that long-range weapons will help Ukraine take out Russian logistics nodes and troop concentrations that are not on the front lines. Grady declined to identify what specific weapons were being provided but said they will be “very disruptive if used properly, and I’m confident they will be.” Like many of the other sophisticated weapons systems provided to Ukraine, the administration weighed whether their use would risk further escalating the conflict. The administration is continuing to make clear that the weapons cannot be used to hit targets inside Russia. At the State Department, spokesman Vedant Patel said Wednesday that Biden directed his national security team to send the ATACMS specifying that they be used inside Ukrainian sovereign territory. “I think the time is right, and the boss (Biden) made the decision the time is right to provide these based on where the fight is right now,” Grady said Wednesday. “I think it was a very well considered decision, and we really wrung it out — but again, any time you introduce a new system, any change — into a battlefield, you have to think through the escalatory nature of it.” Ukrainian officials haven’t publicly acknowledged the receipt or use of long-range ATACMS. But in thanking Congress for passing the new aid bill Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted on the social platform X that “Ukraine’s long-range capabilities, artillery and air defense are extremely important tools for the quick restoration of a just peace.” One of the U.S. officials said the Biden administration warned Russia last year that if Moscow acquired and used long-range ballistic missiles in Ukraine, Washington would provide the same capability to Kyiv. Russia got some of those weapons from North Korea and has used them on the battlefield in Ukraine, said the official, prompting the Biden administration to greenlight the new long-range missiles. The U.S. had refused to confirm that the long-range missiles were given to Ukraine until they were actually used on the battlefield and Kyiv leaders approved the public release. One official said the weapons were used early last week to strike the airfield in Dzhankoi, a city in Crimea, a peninsula that Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. They were used again overnight east of the occupied city of Berdyansk. Videos on social media last week showed the explosions at the military airfield, but officials at the time would not confirm it was the ATACMS. Ukraine’s first use of the weapon came as political gridlock in Congress had delayed approval of a $95 billion foreign aid package for months, including funding for Ukraine, Israel and other allies. Facing acute shortages of artillery and air defense systems, Ukraine has been rationing its munitions as U.S. funding was delayed. With the war now in its third year, Russia used the delay in U.S. weapons deliveries and its own edge in firepower and personnel to step up attacks across eastern Ukraine. It has increasingly used satellite-guided gliding bombs — dropped from planes from a safe distance — to pummel Ukrainian forces beset by a shortage of troops and ammunition. The mid-range missiles provided last year, and some of the long-range ones sent more recently, carry cluster munitions that open in the air when fired, releasing hundreds of bomblets rather than a single warhead. Others sent recently have a single warhead. One critical factor in the March decision to send the weapons was the U.S. Army’s ability to begin replacing the older ATACMS. The Army is now buying the Precision Strike Missile, so is more comfortable taking ATACMS off the shelves to provide to Ukraine, the official said.",

        "text": "Israel Says 'Moving Ahead' With Rafah Attack To Hit Hamas Hold-Outs, Defies Egypt's Warning | 10 Points   \n         Jerusalem:  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have intensified their presence in the Rafah region of the Gaza Strip, signaling a potential ground invasion. Israeli forces are “moving forward” with a ground operation in Rafah, a city in the southern Gaza Strip, despite global warnings of a humanitarian crisis. The military is making arrangements to evacuate Palestinian civilians before the anticipated assault on Hamas strongholds in Rafah. A senior Israeli defense official confirmed the progress, stating that all necessary preparations for taking over Rafah are finalized, awaiting government approval for the operation to commence.  \n             A spokesperson for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government said that Israel was “moving ahead” with a ground operation in Rafah. The defence official, however, gave no timeline. The elite Nahal Brigade, known for its strategic capabilities, has been strategically deployed, local media reported. Despite objections from the US and Western allies, Israel’s defense ministry has mobilized key brigades, including the Yuftah armoured brigade and Carmeli infantry brigade, to facilitate the Nahal brigade’s movement into Rafah. This move follows the brigade’s prior involvement in operations in Central Gaza and Khan Younis, areas crucial to Hamas. The IDF’s readiness is evident with six Hamas battalions, including those in Rafah, under surveillance. The Israeli government awaits a political decision to initiate the ground offensive, with the Nahal brigade poised to lead. \n             \n           High-level Israeli officials have engaged with Egyptian counterparts to address concerns over potential civilian and refugee crises resulting from an attack on Rafah. Egypt’s President El-Sissi and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken have both expressed apprehensions regarding the situation. Israeli intelligence agencies emphasize the significance of the Rafah operation in the broader conflict against Hamas. Prime Minister Netanyahu’s affirmation of a forthcoming ground operation underscores the gravity of the situation, although a specific timeline remains undisclosed. \n Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said Israel is “moving ahead” with its planned military operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where 1.5 Palestinians are sheltering. \n Israel, which launched its war to annihilate Hamas after the Islamist group’s Oct. 7 attacks on Israeli towns, says Rafah is home to four Hamas combat battalions reinforced by thousands of retreating fighters, and it must defeat them to achieve victory. \n Egypt says it will not allow Gazans to be pushed across the border onto its territory. Cairo had warned Israel against moving on Rafah, which “would lead to massive human massacres, losses (and) widespread destruction”, its State Information Service said. \n Egypt welcomed the return of Palestinians northwards from Rafah, believing it to be in the interest of the population despite also serving Israeli plans to besiege Hamas in Rafah. \n Israel has withdrawn most of its ground troops from southern Gaza this month but kept up air strikes and conducted raids into areas its troops abandoned. \n Hamas killed 1,200 people and abducted 253 on Oct 7, according to Israeli tallies. Of those hostages, 129 remain in Gaza, Israeli officials say. More than 260 Israeli troops have been killed in ground fighting since Oct 20, the military says. \n Calls grow for an international investigation into mass graves discovered in the vicinity of Nasser Hospital in Gaza’s Khan Younis as more than 310 bodies are recovered so far. \n Fears for the safety of tens of thousands of civilians in northern Gaza’s Beit Lahiya have surged as Israeli troops attack the city “with extreme force” and order Palestinian residents to flee immediately. \n Hamas has released a video of Israeli-American captive Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who appeared in footage that prompted hundreds of protesters in Jerusalem to m \n arch to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence to demand action. \n Yemen’s Houthi rebels have said its fighters targeted the Maersk Yorktown ship and a US warship in the Gulf of Aden, as well as the Israeli ship MSC Veracruz in the Indian Ocean.",

        "text": "Three India-Based Firms Among Dozen Companies Slapped With US Sanctions For 'Illicit Trade' With Iran   \n         The US Department of Treasury has recently announced sanctions against over a dozen companies, individuals, and vessels involved in facilitating illicit trade and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) transfers on behalf of the Iranian military. This move comes in response to their central role in supporting the clandestine sale of Iranian UAVs for Russia’s operations in Ukraine. The main front company identified in these activities is Sahara Thunder, responsible for overseeing Iran’s commercial endeavors in this regard.  \n             Sanctions have also been imposed on three India-based companies for their support of Sahara Thunder. These companies, namely Zen Shipping, Port India Private Limited, and Sea Art Ship Management (OPC) Private Limited. The Iranian military entity Sahara Thunder heavily relies on an extensive shipping network to carry out the sale and transportation of Iranian goods on behalf of Iran’s Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) to various destinations, including the People’s Republic of China, Russia, and Venezuela. “Sahara Thunder also plays a key role in Iran’s design, development, manufacture, and sale of thousands of UAVs, many of them ultimately transferred to Russia for use in its war of aggression against Ukraine,” the statement read. “Sahara Thunder has used the CHEM to conduct multiple shipments of commodities since 2022. Iran-based Arsang Safe Trading Co has provided ship management services in support of several Sahara Thunder-related shipments, including those by the CHEM,” it added. \n             \n           Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian E Nelson, said, “The United States, in close coordination with our British and Canadian partners, will continue to use all means available to combat those who would finance Iran’s destabilizing activities.” “Iran’s Ministry of Defense continues to destabilize the region and world with its support to Russia’s war in Ukraine, unprecedented attack on Israel, and proliferation of UAVs and other dangerous military hardware to terrorist proxies,” he said.",

        "description": "There were no immediate details of the conversation, which took place as Israel vows to invade Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah despite global concern for more than 1 million Palestinians sheltering there.",
        "text": "People protest against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government and call for the release of hostages held in the Gaza Strip by the Hamas militant group in Tel Aviv, Israel, Saturday, April 27, 2024. (AP Photo/Ohad Zwigenberg)   \n         TEL AVIV, Israel:  The White House on Sunday said President Joe Biden had again spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as pressure builds on Israel and Hamas to reach a deal that would free some Israeli hostages and bring a cease-fire in the nearly seven-month-long war in Gaza.  \n             There were no immediate details of the conversation, which took place as Israel vows to invade Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah despite global concern for more than 1 million Palestinians sheltering there. The U.S. secretary of state is returning to the Middle East on Monday. A senior official from key intermediary Qatar, meanwhile, urged Israel and Hamas to show “more commitment and more seriousness” in negotiations. Qatar, which hosts Hamas’ headquarters in Doha, was instrumental along with the U.S. and Egypt in helping negotiate a brief halt to the fighting in November that led to the release of dozens of hostages. But in a sign of frustration, Qatar this month said that it was reassessing its role. An Israeli delegation is expected in Egypt in the coming days to discuss the latest proposals in negotiations, and senior Hamas official Basem Naim said in a message to The Associated Press that a delegation from the militant group will also head to Cairo. Egypt’s state-owned al-Qahera TV said the delegation would arrive on Monday. \n             \n           The comments by Qatar’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari in interviews with the liberal daily Haaretz and Israeli public broadcaster Kan were published and aired Saturday evening. Al-Ansari expressed disappointment with Hamas and Israel, saying each side has made decisions based on political interests and not with civilians’ welfare in mind. He didn’t reveal details on the talks other than to say they have “effectively stopped,” with “both sides entrenched in their positions.” Al-Ansari’s remarks came after an Egyptian delegation discussed with Israeli officials a “new vision” for a prolonged cease-fire in Gaza, according to an Egyptian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss developments. The Egyptian official said that Israeli officials are open to discussing establishing a permanent cease-fire in Gaza as part of the second phase of a deal. Israel has refused to end the war until it defeats Hamas. The second phase would start after the release of civilian and sick hostages, and would include negotiating the release of soldiers, the official added. Senior Palestinian prisoners would be released and a reconstruction process launched. Negotiations earlier this month centered on a six-week cease-fire proposal and the release of 40 civilian and sick hostages held by Hamas in exchange for freeing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. A letter written by Biden and 17 other world leaders urged Hamas to release the hostages immediately. Hamas in recent days has released new videos of three hostages, an apparent push for Israel to make concessions. The growing pressure for Hamas and Israel to reach a cease-fire deal is also meant to avert an Israeli attack on Rafah, the city on the border with Egypt where more than half of Gaza’s 2.3 million population is seeking shelter. Israel has massed dozens of tanks and armored vehicles. The planned incursion has raised global alarm. “Only a small strike is all it takes to force everyone to leave Palestine,” Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas asserted to the opening session of the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia, adding that he believed an invasion would happen within days. But White House national security spokesman John Kirby told ABC that Israel “assured us they won’t go into Rafah until we’ve had a chance to really share our perspectives and concerns with them. So, we’ll see where that goes.” The Israeli troop buildup may also be a pressure tactic on Hamas in talks. Israel sees Rafah as Hamas’ last major stronghold. It vows to destroy the group’s military and governing capabilities. Aid groups have warned that an invasion of Rafah would worsen the already desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza, where hunger is widespread. About 400 tons of aid arrived Sunday at the Israeli port of Ashdod — the largest shipment yet by sea via Cyprus — according to the United Arab Emirates. It wasn’t immediately clear how or when it would be delivered into Gaza. Also on Sunday, World Central Kitchen said that it would resume operations in Gaza on Monday, ending a four-week suspension after Israeli military drones killed seven of its aid workers. The organization has 276 trucks ready to enter through the Rafah crossing and will also send trucks into Gaza from Jordan, a statement said. It’s also examining if the Ashdod port can be used to offload supplies. The war was sparked by Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7 into southern Israel, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities, who say another 250 people were taken hostage. Hamas and other groups are holding about 130 people, including the remains of about 30, Israeli authorities say. Israel’s retaliatory assault on Hamas has killed more than 34,000 people, most of them women and children, according to health authorities in Gaza, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their tally. The Israeli military blames Hamas for civilian casualties, accusing it of embedding in residential and public areas. It says it has killed at least 12,000 militants, without providing evidence.",

        "description": "The Houthis have vowed to cease their attacks on one of the world's busiest maritime routes if Israel halts its offensive in Gaza.",
        "text": "Sana’a : In a latest development, Yemen’s Houthis have attacked again, as reports suggest, damaging an oil tanker and a US drone shot down amid escalating tensions over Israel’s offensive in Gaza, Al Jazeera reported. In his latest televised address, the Houthis’ military spokesman, Yahya Saree, claimed responsibility for targeting the “British oil ship Andromeda Star” in the Red Sea with naval missiles. The vessel sustained minor damage, according to the US Central Command (CENTCOM), but is continuing its journey unimpeded.  \n             There were no injuries reported among the maritime military coalition deployed in the area to counter such attacks. Saree also announced the downing of a MQ-9 Reaper drone operated by the US military, stating it was shot down while conducting hostile missions in the airspace of Yemen’s Saada governorate. The US military has yet to comment on the incident, but CBS News confirmed the crash of an MQ-9 inside Yemen, sparking an ongoing investigation, according to Al Jazeera. This marks the third US drone shot down by the Houthis since the outset of the conflict in Gaza, with previous incidents occurring in November and February. Despite this, the Houthis have remained silent on further attacks against vessels in nearby waters, although the US military reported anti-ship missiles being fired at the MV MAISH, a vessel flying the Antigua/Barbados flag. \n             \n           The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) confirmed two attacks on a vessel, likely the MV Andromeda Star, near al-Mukha (Mocha) in Yemen. The first explosion occurred in close proximity to the vessel, followed by a second attack involving two missiles, resulting in damage. The Houthi military’s recent activity follows their claim of targeting the “Israeli ship MSC Darwin” in the Gulf of Aden and launching missiles and drones at targets in Israel’s southern port city of Eilat. Prior to this, they had attacked the US-flagged Maersk Yorktown and the Israeli-linked MSC Veracruz, prompting defence responses from US and UK warships. Abdel-Malik al-Houthi, the group’s leader, dismissed suggestions of diminished military capabilities, asserting that more attacks are imminent. Addressing demonstrators in Sanaa and beyond, he declared a new theatre of confrontation, targeting ships in the Indian Ocean as well, as reported by Al Jazeera. The Houthis have vowed to cease their attacks on one of the world’s busiest maritime routes if Israel halts its offensive in Gaza. These attacks have not only disrupted global trade but also impacted traffic at Israel’s Eilat port. In Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, large-scale protests have been a weekly occurrence since the conflict began, expressing solidarity with Palestinians and condemning Israel and its allies. Initially focused on Israeli-linked ships in the Bab al-Mandeb strait, the Houthis have since broadened their targets to include US and UK vessels following military actions by Washington and London in Yemen. Houthi-run media reported millions more joining demonstrations across Yemen, highlighting the widespread support for their cause, Al Jazeera reported. (With inputs from ANI)",

During the telephone conversation, both leaders discussed Israel’s plan to allow aid into the war-affected Gaza Strip by opening more crossings this week, facilitating increased humanitarian assistance in the region, as per a White House statement.  \n             The crossings in question are – Karni, Erez crossings and Gate 96 are ready to be opened by Israel so that humanitarian aid can go to Gaza. However, opening of more crossings is important for ensuring a steady influx of aid into Gaza. Moreover, these points of entry could gain even more significance if Israel chooses to execute a substantial incursion into Rafah. Such a move has the potential to isolate the current hub for humanitarian relief from the remainder of Gaza, The Times of Israel reported. The White House readout also stated that the two leaders discussed a potential Israeli offensive in Rafah and that Biden “reiterated his clear position.” While the readout doesn’t provide additional details, the US has made it clear that it cannot endorse any operation that fails to guarantee the complete protection of the more than one million Palestinians seeking refuge in Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city. Moreover, US officials have consistently voiced their opposition to a significant operation in Rafah without any exceptions, according to the Times of Israel. \n             \n           In relation to recent improvements in the flow of aid into Gaza, Biden on the call “stressed the need for this progress to be sustained and enhanced in full coordination with humanitarian organisations.” In the midst of the strife, discussions concerning the security of humanitarian personnel continue, especially after an unfortunate incident where a bombing by Israel led to the tragic loss of seven World Central Kitchen employees. Israel has now put measures in place to prevent such accidents. President Biden, in a discourse, acknowledged progress in Gaza aid distribution. However, The Times of Israel reports that the US is of the opinion that Tel Aviv still has more work to do in this regard. The two leaders also “reviewed ongoing talks to secure the release of hostages together with an immediate ceasefire in Gaza”. “The President referred to his statement with 17 other world leaders demanding that Hamas release their citizens without delay to secure a ceasefire and relief for the people of Gaza,” according to the White House readout. In call with Netanyahu, President Biden also “reaffirmed his ironclad commitment to Israel’s security following the successful defence against Iran’s unprecedented missile and drone attack earlier this month”.",

        "text": "US 'Hopeful' Hamas Will Accept 'Extraordinarily Generous' Ceasefire Proposal By Israel    \n         US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has expressed hope that Hamas will accept Israel’s latest proposal for a Gaza truce and the release of hostages. Blinken referred to Israel’s offer as ‘extraordinarily generous’ during discussions with a Hamas delegation mediated by Egypt and Qatar. A source close to the talks told the BBC they were cautiously optimistic about the potential agreement.  \n             The proposed deal includes a 40-day truce in exchange for the release of hostages and the possibility of allowing displaced families to return to northern Gaza. Additionally, the agreement features revised wording aimed at achieving a lasting calm to meet Hamas’s insistence on a permanent ceasefire. The Hamas delegation has departed Cairo and is expected to return with a formal response to the proposal. “Hamas has before it a proposal that is extraordinarily, extraordinarily generous on the part of Israel,” Blinken said during a panel discussion at the WEF. “And in this moment, the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a cease-fire is Hamas. They have to decide, and they have to decide quickly,” he continued. “I’m hopeful that they will make the right decision.” Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, also present in Riyadh, shared a similar sentiment, expressing optimism about the proposal’s acceptance by both Israel and Hamas.”There is a proposal on the table, up to the two sides to consider and accept but certainly the objective is a ceasefire, a permanent ceasefire and dealing with the humanitarian conditions,” Shoukry told a panel at the WEF in Riyadh on Monday, according to CNN. He also said that he is hopeful “the proposal has been taken into account” and that “we are waiting to have a final decision.” \n             \n           International Pressure Israel is facing mounting pressure from its global allies and hostage families to reach a resolution. The conflict escalated when Israel Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group’s cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage. The toll on Gaza has been devastating, with thousands of lives lost and significant destruction. Ongoing Negotiations Efforts to secure a truce and the release of remaining hostages have been ongoing, with mediators from Egypt, Qatar, and the US working tirelessly to broker a new agreement. Despite previous failed attempts, the current discussions aim to halt the violence and ensure the safe return of hostages held by both sides. Hamas’s Stance Hamas has maintained its position, rejecting previous truce offers that did not align with its demands for a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. The group remains steadfast in its commitment to securing a lasting peace that addresses the needs of Palestinians displaced by the conflict. \n Hamas has only said publicly that it is studying the new Israeli proposal, but an unnamed senior official told AFP news agency on Sunday that “the atmosphere is positive unless there are new Israeli obstacles”.  \n \n “There are no major issues in the observations and inquiries submitted by Hamas regarding the contents [of the proposal],” they added.  \n There are still about 133 hostages who were kidnapped from Israel on Oct. 7 that have not been released by Hamas. But its unclear how may Hamas actually holds after its shocking invasion on the south of the country, killing people in their communities, at a music festival, and taking more than 250 people hostage.",

        "description": "The budget increase, which was approved by Israeli parliamentarians, shows how committed the government is to maintaining national security in the face of unstable regional conditions.",
        "text": "Israel Hamas War   \n         Tel Aviv:  Amid the everyday escalating war between Israel and Hamas militants, Knesset has passed an amended wartime budget 62-55 after two days of furious debate. This budget consists of the costs associated with the “Iron Swords” battle against Hamas in Gaza. The revised state budget, which amounts to over 584 billion shekels (USD 162 billion), shows an expenditure rise of roughly 70 billion shekels (USD 19.4 billion). The move comes as the nation grapples with escalating tensions and the need for bolstered defense capabilities.  \n             What Does This Budget Include? The budget includes a large increase in defense spending for the purpose of strengthening the army and covering the cost of fighting; it also includes provisions for protecting settlements close to Gaza and providing security for those settlements; and it provides substantial funding for the mental health system, , the budgeting of the Takuma administration for the reconstruction of the surrounding area, the evacuation of settlements, and support in the acceleration of the high-tech industry and the real estate industry. Why Did Israel Increase Its Defense Budget? The budget increase, which was approved by Israeli parliamentarians, shows how committed the government is to maintaining national security in the face of unstable regional conditions. The extra cash is designated for vital defense spending, such as military operations, the purchase of cutting-edge weapons, and the defense of vital infrastructure. The budget update anchors a projected deficit of about 6.6 percent of GDP for 2024, and includes adjustments in the amount of about 20 billion shekels (USD 5.6 billion) in 2024 and 2025. \n             \n           Add-ons To New Budget A number of other measures to boost state revenues were also approved by the government, including taxing bank profits and shortening the recuperation day for salaried workers as part of a deal with Israel’s major labor union. Shlomi Heisler, Director General of the Ministry of Finance, said, “The updated budget for 2024 will allow the reservists and reserve networks to be rewarded for their contribution to the state’s security as well as the implementation of the war efforts, strengthening the resilience of the Israeli economy.” This decision demonstrates Israel’s steadfast commitment to defending its citizens and preserving its sovereignty in the face of changing security risks. The budget increase comes at a time when tensions are rising and Israel has to be better prepared to handle new challenges and strengthen its defense mechanism. (With inputs from ANI)",

Meanwhile, Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) announced that humanitarian aid will for the first time enter Gaza by sea. \n“Humanitarian aid entering Gaza from land, air and sea: For the first time, humanitarian aid to arrive to Gaza by sea.

        "text": "Representative Image   \n         Cairo:  Stalled talks aimed at securing a cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas are expected to resume in earnest in Qatar as soon as Sunday, according to Egyptian officials.  \n             The talks would mark the first time both Israeli officials and Hamas leaders join the indirect negotiations since the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. International mediators had hoped to secure a six-week truce before Ramadan started earlier this week, but Hamas refused any deal that wouldn’t lead to a permanent cease-fire in Gaza, a demand Israel rejected. In recent days, however, both sides have made moves aimed at getting the talks, which never fully broke off, back on track. Hamas gave mediators a new proposal for a three-stage plan that would end the fighting, according to two Egyptian officials, one who is involved in the talks and a second who was briefed on them. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to reveal the contents of the sensitive discussions. \n             \n           The first stage would be a six-week cease-fire that would see the release of 35 hostages — women, those who are ill and older people — held by militants in Gaza in exchange for 350 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Hamas would also release at least five female soldiers in exchange for 50 prisoners, including some serving long sentences on terror charges, for each soldier. Israeli forces would withdraw from two main roads in Gaza, let displaced Palestinians return to northern Gaza, which has been devastated by the fighting, and allow the free flow of aid to the area, the officials said. Nearly one in three children under 2 years old in the isolated north have acute malnutrition, the United Nations children’s agency said Friday. In the second phase, the two sides would declare a permanent cease-fire and Hamas would free the remaining Israeli soldiers held hostage in exchange for more prisoners, the officials said. In the third phase, Hamas would hand over the bodies it’s holding in exchange for Israel lifting the blockade of Gaza and allowing reconstruction to start, the officials said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the proposal “unrealistic.” However, he agreed to send Israeli negotiators to Qatar for more talks. Those talks were expected to resume Sunday afternoon, though they could get pushed to Monday, the Egyptian officials said. Netanyahu’s government has rejected calls for a permanent cease-fire, insisting it must first fulfill its stated goal of “annihilating Hamas.” Netanyahu’s office also said Friday he approved military plans to attack Rafah, the southernmost town in Gaza where some 1.4 million displaced Palestinians — more than half the enclave’s population — are sheltering. Many Palestinians fled to Rafah when Israel attacked Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and left another 250 hostage. The United States and other countries have warned that a military operation in Rafah could be disastrous, but Israel says it plans to push ahead to destroy Hamas battalions stationed there. Netanyahu’s office did not give details or a timetable for the Rafah operation but said it would involve the evacuation of the civilian population. The military has said it planned to direct civilians to “humanitarian islands” in central Gaza. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday the U.S. has yet to see “a clear and implementable plan” to safeguard innocent people in Rafah from an Israeli incursion. The Gaza Health Ministry said Saturday that at least 31,553 Palestinians have been killed in the war. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count but says women and children make up two-thirds of the dead. An Israeli strike early Saturday flattened a house in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing at least 19 people including nine children, according to records at the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital. An Associated Press journalist there saw the bodies. Israel’s offensive has driven most of Gaza’s 2.3 million people from their homes. A quarter of Gaza’s population is starving, according to the U.N. As part of efforts to get desperately needed aid into Gaza, a ship inaugurated a sea route from Cyprus on Friday and offloaded 200 tons of humanitarian supplies sent by the aid group World Central Kitchen destined for people in northern Gaza. The group said Saturday it was preparing another vessel in Cyprus with hundreds of tons of Gaza-bound aid. Also on Saturday, Germany joined a group of countries, including the U.S. and Jordan, in conducting airdrops of aid over Gaza. The U.S. also has announced separate plans to construct a pier to get aid in. Displaced Palestinians living in tents along the Mediterranean coast remained hungry and bleak. “The situation is so bad that no one can imagine it, and the ship, even if it helps, will be a drop in the ocean,” said Zahr Saqr in Muwasi. “We run like dogs behind air drops.”",

Syria’s civil war has entered its 14th year on Friday March 15, 2024, a somber anniversary in a long-frozen conflict. (AP Photo/Baderkhan Ahmad, File)   \n         Israeli Airstrikes Hit Southern Syria:  The Syrian state media reported on Sunday that Israeli airstrikes hit several sites in southern Syria early Sunday in which a soldier was wounded.  \n             SANA, the state news agency, citing an unnamed military official, said air defenses shot down some of the missiles, which came from the direction of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights at around 12:42 a.m. local time adding that the strikes led to “material losses” and the wounding of a soldier. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said Israeli strikes also hit two military sites in the Qalamoun mountains northeast of Damascus and one of the targets was a weapons shipment. Qalamoun Mountains is an area where the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has operations. \n             \n           The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes represented the 24th time Israel has struck inside Syria since the beginning of 2024. They have killed 43 fighters with various groups, including Hezbollah and Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, and nine civilians. There was no immediate statement from Israeli officials on the strikes. Israel frequently launches strikes on Iran-linked targets in Syria but rarely acknowledges them. The strikes have escalated over the past five months against the backdrop of the war in Gaza and ongoing clashes between Hezbollah and Israeli forces on the Lebanon-Israel border. The Israeli army said that last week it carried out 4,500 strikes against Hezbollah targets over the past five months, most of which were in Lebanon, while a few were in Syria. The army said in a statement that it “will not allow for any attempted actions which could lead to the entrenchment of Hezbollah on the Syrian front.” (With AP inputs)",

        "text": "Representative Image   \n         Joe Biden-Benjamin Netanyahu Talk:  Amidst the ongoing military conflict in Israel and Palestine, US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on Monday for the first time in more than a month, as the divide has grown between the two leaders over the food crisis in Gaza and conduct of the war, according to the White House.  \n             It is being said that the call was made after Republicans in Washington and Israeli officials expressed outrage over Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s sharp criticism of Netanyahu’s handling of the war in Gaza and called for Israel to hold new elections. They accused Chuck Schumer of breaking the unwritten rule against interfering in a close ally’s electoral politics. Meanwhile, Biden did not endorse Schumer’s call for election but said he thought he gave a ‘good speech’ that reflected the concerns of many Americans. To put things in perspective, the US government has been skeptical of Netanyahu’s plan of carrying out an operation in the southern city of Rafah, where more than 1 million displaced Palestinians have taken refuge Israel looks to eliminate Hamas following Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 attack. \n             \n           Biden administration officials have warned that they would not support such an operation without the Israelis presenting a credible plan to ensure the safety of innocent Palestinian civilians as White House officials say that Israel has yet to present such a plan. The Biden-Netanyahu call also comes as the United Nations food agency on Monday issued more dire warnings about the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. The World Food Program warned that “famine is imminent” in northern Gaza, where 70% of the remaining population is experiencing catastrophic hunger, and that a further escalation of the war could push around half of Gaza’s population to the brink of starvation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rebuked American criticism on Sunday, describing calls for a new election as “wholly inappropriate” as he told Fox News Channel that Israel never would have called for a new US election after the September 11, 2001, attacks, and he denounced Schumer’s comments as inappropriate. “We’re not a banana republic,” he said. “The people of Israel will choose when they will have elections, and who they’ll elect, and it’s not something that will be foisted on us.” Biden after his State of the Union address earlier this month was caught on a hot mic telling a Democratic ally that he told Netanyahu they would have a “come to Jesus” meeting over the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. His frustration with Netanyahu’s prosecution of the war was also on display in a recent MSNBC interview, in which he asserted Netanyahu was “hurting Israel.” “He has a right to defend Israel, a right to continue to pursue Hamas,” Biden said of Netanyahu in the MSNBC interview. “But he must, he must, he must pay more attention to the innocent lives being lost as a consequence of the actions taken. He’s hurting, in my view, he’s hurting Israel more than helping Israel.” (With AP inputs)",

In a recent address, he emphasized the urgent need for Israel to allow complete and unrestricted access for humanitarian aid across Gaza. Guterres highlighted the critical situation by stating that 1.1 million people in Gaza are on the brink of catastrophic hunger. In a video posted on X, Antonio Guterres said, “I call on the Israeli authorities to ensure complete and unfettered access for humanitarian goods throughout Gaza and for the international community to fully support our humanitarian efforts. We must act now to prevent the unthinkable, the unacceptable and the unjustifiable.  \n             “While sharing the video on X, Guterres wrote, “Famine in the northern part of Gaza is imminent. 1.1 million people in Gaza are facing catastrophic hunger – the highest number of people ever recorded -anywhere, anytime. This is an entirely manmade disaster. And it can – and must – be halted. “Guterres’ statement comes amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. Israel launched the counter-offensive operation against Hamas on October 7. WFP statement on food security situation in Gaza The World Food Programme (WFP) recently released a statement on the serious food security situation in the Gaza Strip, highlighting the alarming levels of food insecurity faced by the population. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report, a staggering 88 per cent of Gaza’s population is currently experiencing ’emergency or worse’ food insecurity. The report also issued a stark warning, stating that famine in northern Gaza is ‘imminent.’ WFP Director Cindy McCain expressed deep concern, emphasizing that people in Gaza are currently starving to death. The rapid escalation of this man-made hunger and malnutrition crisis in Gaza has been described as terrifying by McCain. \n             \n           The IPC report, compiled by a consortium of NGOs, governments, and UN agencies, predicts that without immediate intervention, half of the population of the Gaza Strip, amounting to 1.11 million people, could face catastrophic conditions by mid-July. The report also highlights the acute malnutrition crisis among children in Gaza, with one in three children below the age of two suffering from severe malnutrition. The situation in Southern Gaza is also alarming, with the region edging closer to famine conditions, which could potentially be reached by July. The report underscores the urgent need for aid organizations to be granted access to the Gaza Strip to provide essential food, water, and nutritional support to the population. It emphasizes that a humanitarian ceasefire is crucial to address the impending crisis. The report warns that famine is expected to hit the 300,000 people trapped in Northern Gaza between now and May, further underscoring the critical need for immediate intervention.",

        "description": "Netanyahu categorically made it clear that there is no way to destroy or eliminate Hamas other than the ground operation.",
        "text": "Joe Biden had asked Netanyahu to send a senior team composed of military, intelligence, and humanitarian officials to Washington to discuss an alternative approach.    \n         Tel Aviv : Amid ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday made it clear that the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) will go ahead with the ground operation in Rafah, despite global pressure, and added that he has told US President Joe Biden about the same, the Times of Israel reported.  \n             “We have a disagreement with the Americans about the need to enter Rafah,” Netanyahu told the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Tuesday. “Not about the need to eliminate Hamas — the need to enter Rafah. We do not see a way to eliminate Hamas militarily without destroying these remaining battalions. We are determined to do it,” Netanyahu said. Netanyahu categorically made it clear that there is no way to destroy or eliminate Hamas other than the ground operation. \n             \n           “I made it clear to the president in our conversation, in the clearest way, that we are determined to complete the elimination of these battalions in Rafah,” said Netanyahu., adding, “There is no way to do it, except by going in on the ground.” Biden, during a phone call with Netanyahu on Monday, effectively ruled out any potential support for a major Israeli ground offensive in Rafah, which abuts the Egyptian border in Gaza’s southernmost tip, as reported by the Times of Israel. “A major ground operation would be a mistake. It would lead to more innocent civilian deaths, worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis, deepen the anarchy in Gaza and further isolate Israel internationally,” US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said. Netanyahu added in his discussion with Israeli legislators that the two leaders agreed on a mechanism for the Americans to share their ideas on humanitarian aid and the evacuation of civilians, a concern that he said Israel shares. “We need to complete the military elimination of Hamas,” he said. “There is no substitute for that, you can’t go around it, you can’t say, ‘We’ll destroy 80 per cent of Hamas, we’ll [leave] 20 per cent,’ because that 20 per cent will reorganize and retake the Strip, and of course they will pose a renewed threat to Israel, and of course it will also be a victory for the broader axis that threatens us — the Iranian axis,” Netanyahu added. Meanwhile, the White House readout of Biden’s call with Netanyahu stated that the former had warned against the operation in Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have taken refuge. Biden and Netanyahu agreed to have their teams meet soon in Washington to exchange views and discuss ‘alternative approaches’ that would target key elements of Hamas and secure the Egypt-Gaza border without a major ground operation in Rafah, the White House said. Biden asked Netanyahu to send a senior team composed of military, intelligence, and humanitarian officials to Washington to discuss an alternative approach that would target Hamas in Rafah and secure the Egypt-Gaza border without a major ground invasion.

        "description": "In a two-day summit in Brussels due to start at 1200 GMT, the EU will also tackle topics as diverse as the war in Gaza.",
        "text": "France Establishes Abortion As Constitutional Right; President Macron Pledges To Make It A Basic Right In Europe   \n         Brussels:  European Union leaders will discuss a plan on Thursday to use billions of euros in profits from frozen Russian financial assets to buy arms for Ukraine as they try to bolster Kyiv in its fight against Moscow’s invasion.  \n             The bloc’s 27 national leaders will also debate how Europe can do more to defend itself and boost its arms industry, reflecting fears that Russia may not stop at Ukraine and the U.S. may not be such a staunch protector of Europe in the future. In a two-day summit in Brussels due to start at 1200 GMT on Thursday, they will also tackle topics as diverse as the war in Gaza, the prospect of opening EU membership talks with Bosnia and farmers’ protests. But Ukraine will top the agenda, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy joining the leaders via video link. EU leaders have voiced increasing alarm about the state of the war in recent weeks, with ammunition-starved Ukrainian forces struggling to hold back Russian troops and a $60 billion military aid package for Kyiv stuck in the U.S. Congress. \n             \n           “Into the third year of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, we face a pivotal moment,” Charles Michel, president of the European Council of EU leaders, wrote in his invitation letter for the summit. “Urgency, intensity and unwavering determination are imperative.” The European Commission, the EU’s executive body, this week proposed taking profits from Russian assets frozen in Europe after Moscow’s invasion and transferring some 90% to an EU-run fund used to finance arms for Kyiv. The Commission estimated the profits on the assets – various Russian central bank securities and cash – could be between 2.5 billion euros ($2.73 billion) and 3 billion euros per year. The assets are frozen by EU central securities depositories, mainly Belgium’s Euroclear. Ukraine would also receive the 25% tax that the Belgian government puts on the profits. Russia on Wednesday described the EU plan as banditism and theft. The idea of using the proceeds to benefit Ukraine enjoys broad support among EU governments, diplomats say. But using the money to buy weapons is more problematic for some countries. All Eyes On Orban Much attention will focus on the reaction of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who maintains closer ties to Moscow than other EU leaders and opposes sending arms to Ukraine. The proposal also raises questions for neutral or militarily non-aligned countries such as Malta, Austria and Ireland. No final decision is expected at the summit. But leaders will indicate how the EU should proceed with the proposal. A draft summit declaration said leaders “reviewed progress” on using the revenues “for the benefit of Ukraine, including possibly for funding military support,” and asked EU bodies to “take work forward.”. It also says the EU “is committed to increasing its overall defence readiness and capabilities to match its needs and ambition” amid “rising threats and security challenges.”. It invites officials to scrutinise a European Commission plan to boost Europe’s arms industry by incentivising EU countries to buy European arms and work together on joint projects. The leaders are expected to discuss the vexed question of how greater defence spending should be financed. French President Emmanuel Macron and others have embraced a proposal by Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas for European defence bonds. But other countries, including fiscally cautious Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden, are sceptical. On the war in Gaza, diplomats have been struggling to find a balance in the text that satisfies close allies of Israel such as Hungary, the Czech Republic and Austria, as well as strong advocates of Palestinians such as Spain, Ireland and Belgium. “The text we have now is a fragile vase. I hope this fragile construct will stay,” said a senior EU diplomat.",

        "text": "Representative Inage   \n         Tel Aviv:  In a letter sent to Jewish communities around the world on Wednesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz called for a “unified global advocacy front” to combat a steep rise in international antisemitism amid Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza.  \n             Since October 7, Katz wrote, “Anti-Semitism has surged globally, targeting not just Israel but Jewish communities everywhere. The intimidation faced by many who are now fearful to reveal their Jewish identity is unacceptable. It is a stark reminder that our right to self-defense and existence is being challenged. We cannot stand idle and rely on others to combat for us.” What Will Be The Benefits Of Coalition? He added, “This coalition will combat Anti-Semitism and the vilification of Israel and Jews worldwide across all media fronts, enlisting Israeli citizens, our government, the Diaspora, friends of Israel and the Jewish world and international allies.” Suggestions Of Reports On Antisemitism A report on international antisemitism since October 7 found a six-fold increase in antisemitic incidents in 2023 between October and December, compared to the nine months before Hamas attacked Israeli communities. \n             \n           “On a yearly basis, 2023 ended with a 235 percent increase in antisemitic incidents, compared to 2022, with 43 percent of monitored events occurring in the USA and 35 percent in Europe,” said the report, which was prepared by Israel’s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs, the Jewish Agency, and the World Zionist Organization. Released in January, the report noted a 337 percent increase in antisemitic attacks in the US, a 512 percent rise in Britain, and a 738 percent increase in Australia. The highest increase in antisemitic attacks was in Brazil with a 961 percent rise.

        "text": "Finland: For 5th Consecutive Year, This Country Holds The Prestigious Title of The Happiest Country of 2022. Picture Credits: Unsplash   \n         India is ranked 126th out of 143 nations in the global happiness index released on Wednesday. This ranking is based on the overall happiness levels in the country, with older age being associated with higher life satisfaction in India. The World Happiness Report 2024 revealed that Finland emerged as the happiest country in the world, maintaining its top position for the seventh consecutive year.  \n             The top 10 countries in the happiness index include Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, Israel, Netherlands, Norway, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and Australia. India, however, finds itself at the 126th spot, lagging behind countries like Libya, Iraq, Palestine, and Niger. These findings were announced to mark the UN’s International Day of Happiness. On the other hand, the United States has dropped out of the top 20 for the first time, mainly due to a significant decline in the well-being of Americans under 30. Afghanistan remains at the bottom of the rankings as the ‘unhappiest’ nation, while Pakistan is placed at 108th on the list. Factors Influencing Happiness The report highlighted that the young population in India tends to be the happiest, while those in the lower-middle-income bracket are the least happy. \n             \n           The report said that older age is associated with higher life satisfaction in India, “refuting some claims that the positive association between age and life satisfaction only exists in high-income nations.” On average, older men in India are more satisfied with life than older women “but when taking all other measures into account, older women report higher life satisfaction than their male counterparts,” it said. In India, older adults with secondary or higher education and those of higher social castes report higher life satisfaction than counterparts without formal education and those from scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. “India’s older population is the second largest worldwide, with 140 million Indians aged 60 and over, second only to its 250 million Chinese counterparts. Additionally, the average growth rate for Indians aged 60 and above is three times higher than the overall population growth rate of the country,” the report said. Satisfaction with living arrangements, perceived discrimination, and self-rated health emerge as the top three predictors of life satisfaction for India in this study, the report said. “We found that older men, those in the higher age groups, currently married, and those who were educated, report higher life satisfaction compared to their respective peers. Lower satisfaction with living arrangements, perceived discrimination, and poor self-rated health were important factors associated with low life satisfaction among older Indians,” it said. The findings of this study indicate that strengthening family networks to ensure a comfortable living arrangement for older adults, men, widowed, and those without formal education in particular, and bolstering social networks to reduce discrimination may enhance well-being in older age, it noted. The report added that Serbia (37th) and Bulgaria (81st) have had the biggest increases in average life evaluation scores since they were first measured by the Gallup World Poll in 2013. The next two countries showing the largest increases in life evaluations are Latvia (46th) and Congo (Brazzaville) (89th), with rank increases of 44 and 40 places, respectively, between 2013 and 2024. For the first time, the report gives separate rankings by age group, in many cases varying widely from the overall rankings. Lithuania tops the list for children and young people under 30, while Denmark is the world’s happiest nation for those 60 and older. The World Happiness Report is a collaborative effort between Gallup, the Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, and the WHR’s Editorial Board. This partnership aims to provide valuable insights into global happiness levels and factors influencing well-being across different nations. (With inputs from agencies)",

The Division bench led by Justice Suresh Kumar Kait will hear the matter this morning. The Enforcement Directorate has issued 9 summons to him in the Excise case till now.

No end date for the operation was given. “The forces are continuing to operate in and to search the area, locating weapons and apprehending terrorists in close-quarter encounters,” the statement said. \n             \n           The recent operation began early on Monday, with the Israeli forces attacking the compound in Gaza city with tanks and airstrikes. On Thursday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported that Israeli forces blew up the specialised surgical building and that communication with all medical teams inside the medical complex was lost.

        "description": "An official communique by the White House said the meeting between the President Joe Biden and Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani is scheduled for April 15.",
        "text": "The meeting between US President Joe Biden and Iraqi PM al-Sudani comes amid talks between the two countries about the ending the military coalition that was formed to fight the Islamic State group. (File Photo)   \n         Washington, United States:  United States President  Joe Biden  plans to host Iraqi Prime Minister  Mohammed Shia al-Sudani , amid formal talks between the two nations about winding down a US-led military coalition which was formed to fight the Islamic State terrorist organisation in Iraq.  \n             An official communique by the White House said the meeting between the two leaders is scheduled for April 15. The leaders will “consult on a range of issues,” including the fight against the Islamic State and “ongoing Iraqi financial reforms to promote economic development and progress toward Iraq’s financial independence and modernization,” the White House said. US and Iraq have a delicate relationship due in part to Iran’s considerable sway in Iraq, where a coalition of Iran-backed groups brought al-Sudani to power in October 2022. \n             \n           In recent months, the United States has urged Iraq to do more to prevent attacks on American bases in Iraq and Syria that have further roiled the Middle East in the aftermath of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel. It’s also sought to apply financial pressure over Baghdad’s relationship with Tehran, restricting Iraq’s access to its own dollars in an effort to stamp out money laundering said to benefit Iran and Syria. End of military coalition Meanwhile, the US and Iraq began formal talks in January about ending the coalition created to help the Iraqi government fight the Islamic State, with some 2,000 U.S. troops remaining in the country under an agreement with Baghdad. Iraqi officials have periodically called for a withdrawal of those forces. Elizabeth Tsurkov abduction The visit will also come about a year after the kidnapping in Baghdad of Elizabeth Tsurkov, an Israeli-Russian academic at Princeton University who is believed to be held by an Iran-backed militia, Kataib Hezbollah, that is regarded by Washington as a terrorist group and is seen as one of the most powerful armed groups in Iraq. Notably, Kataib Hezbollah was formed during the power vacuum that followed the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, with support from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. On Thursday, Tsurkov’s sister, Emma, urged the State Department to declare Iraq a state sponsor of terrorism and called on the White House to make the al-Sudani meeting contingent on the prime minister arranging for the release of her sister — something she said that he was empowered to do. “I am appalled that Sudani will be allowed to shake President Biden’s hand while his other hand holds the keys to my sister’s shackles,” Tsurkov said at an event outside the Iraqi Embassy in Washington.

None of the races were in suspense as Biden and Trump have already beaten their major competitors and clinched nominations from the Democrat and Republican parties, respectively. However, the primary races are still closely watched by insiders for turnout and signs of protest voters. For Biden, some liberal voters are registering their anger with Israel’s war against Hamas following the militant group’s Oct. 7 attack. More than 30,000 people, two-thirds of them women and children, have been reported killed by Gaza authorities since Israel launched its offensive. \n             \n           A protest movement launched by Arab American communities in Michigan has spread to several other states. Donald Trump is his party’s dominant figure and has locked up a third straight Republican nomination, but the former President faces dissent from people worried about the immense legal jeopardy he faces or critical of his White House term, which ended shortly after the Jan. 6 “insurrection”, allegedly, mounted by his supporters and fueled by his false theories of election fraud. Saturday’s primary was the Missouri Democratic Party’s first party-run presidential contest since a new law took effect in August 2022. Louisiana’s primaries, meanwhile, come almost four years after the state was the first to postpone its primaries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. (With inputs from the Associated Press)",

        "description": "Simon Harris told the centre-right party's members that he would repay their faith with \"hard work, with blood, sweat and tears, day in and day out with responsibility, with humility and with civility.\"",
        "text": "Simon Harris was elected to parliament in 2011 at the age of 24, having served as a county councillor at the age of 22.   \n         Dublin : After the resignation of Leo Varadkar, the Indian-origin prime minister of Ireland, Simon Harris, will now become Ireland’s youngest prime minister after he was appointed as the new leader of the governing Fine Gael party, reported Al Jazeera.  \n             What Simon Harris Said?  The 37-year-old Simon Harris said that it was the “absolute honour of my life” to be appointed party leader on Sunday, replacing Leo Varadkar, who resigned unexpectedly on Wednesday, saying the party would be better governed under another leader. Harris will be voted in as the Republic of Ireland’s youngest-ever prime minister, known as the taoiseach, when the country’s parliament or Oireachtas, next sits on April 9 due to support from Fine Gael’s coalition partners, Al Jazeera reported. Fine Gael deputy leader Simon Coveney said, “I think he’s done a really good job in securing the leadership in as comprehensive a way as he has.” \n             \n           Harris To Repay People’s Faith With Hard Work  Harris told the centre-right party’s members that he would repay their faith with “hard work, with blood, sweat and tears, day in and day out with responsibility, with humility and with civility.” Harris further voiced out his priorities, insisting that Fine Gael “stands for law and order” and telling members that he wanted to “take our flag back” from nationalists to loud cheers. He also said that he would pursue a “more planned and sustainable” immigration policy, following increased tension over the issue, and that he would “fight against the dangers of populism.” Further on the international arena, he called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and condemned Russia’s “horrific illegal invasion of Ukraine.” Moreover, he will have no more than a year to save the coalition from defeat in parliamentary elections, according to Al Jazeera. In the last three years, polls have put Sinn Fein, a left-wing party that backs unification with Northern Ireland, a British province, as the preferred choice to lead the next government. However, two more polls on Sunday confirmed a recent trend of support for Sinn Fein dropping off highs of 12-18 months ago. Harris, formerly a minister for education, research and science, is best known for taking responsibility for Ireland’s COVID-19 response. Recently, he said that he got involved in politics as an “opinionated, moody teenager” bothered by the lack of educational support for his autistic brother. Although he has spent most of his adult life in parliament, Harris has cast himself as an “accidental politician,” as reported by Al Jazeera. Prior to Harris, Leo Varadkar was the country’s youngest-ever leader when first elected at age 38, as well as Ireland’s first openly gay prime minister. Varadkar made the unexpected statement on Wednesday, stating that he would resign as prime minister as soon as a replacement was selected. (With inputs from ANI)",

        "description": "The Israeli official have warned that any final decision would be based on how many of the inmates were senior militants serving lengthy sentences for violent acts.",
        "text": "Representative Inage   \n         Tel Aviv:  Israeli authorities on Sunday said that they are willing to allow the return of Palestinians displaced from the northern Gaza Strip as part of peace talks, an apparent concession to a key Hamas demand. The warring parties have intensified negotiations, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, for a six-week suspension of Israel’s offensive in exchange for the proposed release of 40 of the 130 hostages held by the Palestinian Hamas group in Gaza.  \n             Hamas has attempted to leverage any agreement into an end to violence and the evacuation of Israeli troops. Israel has ruled this out, stating that it will begin attempts to remove Hamas’ administration and military capabilities. Why Are Authorities Considering Relocation Of Citizens? Hamas also wants to enable hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who left Gaza City and neighbouring regions southward during the first stage of the almost six-month-old conflict to return towards north. However, an Israeli official briefed on the Doha discussions stated that this posture has softened. “We are now willing to discuss the return of some of the displaced,” the official told Reuters, without providing specific numbers. Israeli media suspected that the offer would be confined to women and children in order to deter gunmen from attempting to reinforce those with whom the Israeli military is still fighting in portions of Gaza City. \n             \n           Israel’s Condition Towards Agreement The insider, who sought anonymity, reportedly stated that Israel has agreed in principle to free 700 to 800 Palestinian inmates in exchange for the 40 hostages. That looked to meet Hamas’ demand for the release of 700 to 1,000 inmates, as reported by Reuters on March 15. However, the Israeli official warned that any final decision would be based on how many of the inmates were senior militants serving lengthy sentences for violent acts. Strategic Planning Towards Mediation The move demonstrates Israel’s commitment to regional peace and stability while also meeting the immediate needs of civilians harmed by the violence. By allowing civilian return, Israel hopes to clear the path for rehabilitation operations and humanitarian assistance in North Gaza. The proposed proposal comes amid diplomatic efforts by foreign mediators to arrange a long-term ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian groups. Both sides have engaged in extensive negotiations with the goal of achieving a comprehensive agreement to avert further escalation of violence. While details of the civilian return plan are still being finalized, the willingness shown by Israel to consider such measures reflects a willingness to engage constructively in the peace process. It also signals a recognition of the importance of addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza as a crucial step towards lasting peace in the region. (With inputs from agencies)",

        "description": "The USA abstained drawing an immediate protest from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
        "text": "Linda Thomas-Greenfield, United States Ambassador and Representative to the United Nations, speaks after a vote to abstain as the United Nations Security Council passed a cease-fire resolution in Gaza during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on March 25, 2024. (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle)   \n         United Nations:  The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Monday issued its first demand to halt the fighting in Gaza, calling for a cease-fire during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan after the USA abstained and drawing an immediate protest from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who canceled a planned visit to Washington by a high-level delegation and accused the USA of “retreating” from a “principled position” by allowing the vote to pass without conditioning the ceasefire on the release of hostages held by Hamas.  \n             The resolution passed 14-0 after the U.S. decided not to use its veto power on the resolution, which also demanded the release of all hostages taken captive during Hamas’ Oct. 7 surprise attack in southern Israel. A key reason for past U.S. vetoes of Security Council cease-fire resolutions was the failure to tie them directly to the release of hostages. The U.S. argued that the two issues were linked while Russia and China favored unconditional calls for cease-fires. The resolution approved Monday demands the release of hostages but does not make it a condition for the cease-fire. \n             \n           The U.S. decision to abstain comes at a time of growing tensions between President Joe Biden’s administration and Netanyahu, who has rejected U.S. efforts to prevent a potentially devastating Israeli ground invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah and has dismissed Biden’s call for the eventual creation of a Palestinian state. During its U.S. visit, the Israeli delegation was to present White House officials with its plans for Rafah, where over 1 million Palestinian civilians have sought shelter from the war. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. had been “consistent” in its support for a cease-fire as part of a hostage deal. “The reason we abstained is because this resolution text did not condemn Hamas,” Kirby said. The vote comes after Russia and China vetoed a U.S.-sponsored resolution Friday that would have supported “an immediate and sustained cease-fire” in the Israeli-Hamas conflict. The United States warned that the resolution approved Monday could hurt negotiations to halt hostilities by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar, raising the possibility of another veto, this time by the Americans. Because Ramadan ends next month, the cease-fire demand would last for just two weeks, though the draft says the pause in fighting should lead “to a permanent sustainable cease-fire.” U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said that the resolution “spoke out in support of the ongoing diplomatic efforts,” adding that negotiators were “getting closer to a deal for an immediate cease-fire with the release of all hostages, but we’re not there yet.” “So today, my ask to members of this council and to member states in every region of the world is this speak out and demand unequivocally that Hamas accepts the deal on the table,” she said. The resolution, put forward by the 10 elected council members, was backed by Russia and China and the 22-nation Arab Group at the United Nations. Algeria’s U.N. ambassador, the Arab representative on the council, thanked the council for “finally” demanding a cease-fire. “We look forward to the commitment and the compliance of the Israeli occupying power with this resolution, for them to put an end to the bloodbath without any conditions, to end the suffering of the Palestinian people.” he said. “It is the responsibility of the Security Council to ensure the implementation of the provisions of this resolution.” Shortly before Monday’s vote, the elected members changed the final draft resolution to drop the word “permanent” from its demand that a Ramadan cease-fire will lead to “a permanent sustainable cease-fire,” apparently at the request of the United States. Russia complained that dropping the word could allow Israel “to resume its military operation in the Gaza Strip at any moment” after Ramadan and proposed an amendment to restore it. That amendment was defeated because it failed to get the minimum nine “yes” vote — with three council members voting in favor, the United States voting against, and 11 countries abstaining. Since the start of the war, the Security Council has adopted two resolutions on the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza, but none has called for a cease-fire. More than 32,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed during the fighting, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The agency does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count, but says women and children make up two-thirds of the dead. Gaza also faces a dire humanitarian emergency, with a report from an international authority on hunger warning March 18 that “famine is imminent” in northern Gaza and that escalation of the war could push half of the territory’s 2.3 million people to the brink of starvation. The United States has vetoed three resolutions demanding a cease-fire in Gaza, the most recent an Arab-backed measure on Feb. 20. That resolution was supported by 13 council members with one abstention, reflecting the overwhelming support for a cease-fire. Russia and China vetoed a U.S.-sponsored resolution in late October calling for pauses in the fighting to deliver aid, the protection of civilians and a halt to arming Hamas. They said it did not reflect global calls for a cease-fire. They again vetoed a U.S. resolution Friday, calling it ambiguous and saying it was not the direct demand to end the fighting that much of the world seeks. The vote became another showdown involving world powers that are locked in tense disputes elsewhere, with the United States taking criticism for not being tough enough against its ally Israel, even as tensions between the two countries rise. In previous resolutions, the U.S. has closely intertwined calls for a cease-fire with demands for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza. This resolution, using wording that’s open to interpretation, continued to link the two issues, but not as firmly.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris' Husband Doug Emhoff Admits Having Extramarital Affair During First Marriage: Report   \n         Washington:  US Vice President Kamala Harris has warned Israel of “consequences” if it launches a ground assault on the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, Al Jazeera reported on Monday. In an interview that aired on Sunday, VP Harris said that it would be a “huge mistake” for the Israeli military to move into Rafah city.  \n             The comments appear to underscore the continued strain in relations between Washington and Tel Aviv over the continuation of the Israel-Hamas war since last October. The United States and other Israeli allies continue to warn against the assault on Rafah, where over 1 million Palestinian civilians are sheltering. “We have been clear in multiple conversations and in every way that any major military operation in Rafah would be a huge mistake,” Harris told ABC’s This Week. “I have studied the maps – there’s nowhere for those folks to go. And we’re looking at about a million and a half people in Rafah who are there because they were told to go there,” Harris added. “I am ruling out nothing,” Harris said when she was asked whether there would be consequences from the US if the Israeli operation in the overcrowded city goes ahead. \n             \n           She did not give details of what such consequences might entail. “We’re going to take it one step at a time, but we’ve been very clear in terms of our perspective on whether or not that should happen,” she said, Al Jazeera reported. \nEarlier, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also said on Thursday that a major ground assault on the town of Rafah would be “a mistake” and “unnecessary”. Israel has waged a deadly military offensive on the Palestinian territory since Hamas attacked it on October 7, killing about 1,200 Israeli citizens and taking over 200 people captive. The Israeli military has also imposed a crippling blockade, which has left much of the Gaza population on the verge of starvation. Al Jazeera reported that more than 32,200 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli offensive and over 74,500 injured. Approximately 1.5 million Palestinians have now been pushed into Rafah. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to Blinken’s comments by insisting that Israel is working on ways to evacuate civilians from combat zones and to address the humanitarian needs of Gaza. “I also said that we have no way to defeat Hamas without entering Rafah,” Netanyahu added. “I told him that I hope we would do this with US support but if necessary, we will do it alone.” Resistance to US support for Israel’s military operations in Gaza continues to grow. On Friday, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called on the US to suspend weapons transfers to Israel, Al Jazeera reported. \nThe US is Israel’s top weapons supplier. Washington provides at least USD 3.8 billion in aid to Israel annually, and Biden is working with Congress to secure another USD 14 billion.",

It is also one of the most important Hindu festivals in the country. The festival of colours marks the end of chilly winter season and is a two-day-long festivity. This year, Holi was celebrated on March 25, 2024. Holika Dahan, also known as Choti Holi, was celebrated on Sunday, March 24, 2024. The festival is a perfect occasion for family and friends to unite, smear each other with vibrant powders and bask in the overwhelming joy of togetherness. The streets come alive with an explosion of colors as people step out of their homes, brimming with excitement to indulge in the celebrations. Holi, the festival of colors, is all about spreading color, rekindling familial bonds, and swaying to the beat of traditional drums. The festival wouldn’t be complete without the mouthwatering traditional delicacies like ‘gujiya’, ‘mathri’, ‘malpuas’, ‘bhang’, and ‘thandai’. Indeed, they add a taste of tradition to the whole celebration.",

        "text": "UN Chief Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that it is high time for a deal to be secured and bring an end to the war.    \n         New York : United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited the Wihdat Camp for Palestine refugees during his ongoing Ramadan solidarity visit to Jordan. UN Chief Guterres is on a visit to meet Palestine refugees being served by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Jordan.  \n             “We are at a centre dedicated to the well-being of Palestine refugees. Allow me to begin with an invitation to join me in a moment of silence in tribute to our United Nations colleagues and all others who have been killed in this conflict,” he said in his opening remarks. Emphasising that UNRWA is a hot topic these days, he said that, however, one fundamental thing is often lost in the debate, i.e., people. He further highlighted that Jordan is home to 2.4 million Palestinian refugees, the largest number in the region. \n             \n           During his visit, he also heard stories and saw a glimpse of UNRWA’s exceptional work in the region. “I had the privilege to visit a health centre where young mothers and their children are receiving high-quality primary health care, where labs perform state-of-the-art medical tests, and where a pharmacy is dispensing life-saving medication to patients at no charge,” he said. Additionally, he sat in on science and English language classes at a girls’ school and saw young women in a science lab learning and experimenting with principles from Archimedes. “I visited a class teaching English along with the values of human rights and conflict resolution. I also met with 6 truly inspiring young student parliamentarian leaders, including 3 students from Gaza. It was a heartwarming visit in heartbreaking times,” Guterres added. UN Chief Guterres further emphasised that the UNRWA is a lifeline of hope and dignity, not just in Jordan, but also in Syria, Lebanon, the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Further, he said that UNRWA is providing education for over half a million girls and boys, health care for around 2 million people, extending job opportunities and community and family support, and ensuring a social safety net for nearly half a million of the poorest Palestinians. “Beyond and behind those facts, UNRWA is profoundly contributing in ways that can’t be measured on a graph–advancing social cohesion, promoting stability and building peace,” he said. Guterres added, “Imagine if all of this was taken away. It would be cruel and incomprehensible – especially as we honour the 171 women and men of UNRWA who have been killed in Gaza – the largest number of deaths of UN staff in our history.” He further assured that UNRWA would ensure that it would abide by the values of the United Nations in all its actions. “So, taking into account recent unacceptable events, an independent review is well underway to strengthen and improve UNRWA, and I look forward to its recommendations. We must strive to keep the one-of-a-kind services that UNRWA provides flowing because that keeps hope flowing,” he said. Guterres stressed that, in a darkening world, UNRWA is the one ray of light for millions of people. “I trust that, working all together, we will be able to mobilise the international community to make sure that UNRWA will be able to provide its essential services to Palestinian refugees here in Jordan and in all other areas where UNRWA is active,” he said.",

        "text": "Representative Image   \n         Tel Aviv:  Israel’s Ministry of Transportation expects that more than 1.2 million passengers will pass through Ben Gurion Airport in the month of April.  \n             The high rate of traffic, in spite of the ongoing war in Gaza, is anticipated due to the upcoming Passover holiday and more international airlines that are expected to soon resume service to Israel. \nNumerous people from around the world will visit Israel during the holiday and many Israelis will travel abroad. What Is Israel’s Expectation? About 60,000 passengers a day are expected to pass through Israel during the Passover holiday on international flights. The peak day in Israel is expected to be April 21, the eve of the holiday. However, due to the security situation, the volume of passengers during the Passover holiday this year is expected to be about 40 per cent lower compared to the corresponding period last year, said the ministry. \n             \n           Popular Destination In Israel The leading destinations for Israelis in Pesach 2024 will be Greece and Cyprus, with approximately 60 aircraft travelling between the countries per day and approximately 1,840 total flights during the month of April.

        "text": "Joe Biden said that he would not cut off weapons like the Iron Dome missile interceptors, which are crucial for protecting Israeli civilians from rocket attacks.   \n         Washington:  Foreseeing the alertness of 22 Indian crew members who were onboard the ‘Dali’, the ship which Collided with a bridge in Baltimore, US President Joe Biden Commended the quick action of signalling ‘Mayday’ by Indian crew members, which help in prevention of more causalities in the unfortunate incident.  \n             Commendation From White House “The personnel onboard the ship were able to notify the Maryland Department of Transportation that they had lost control of their vessel. As a result, local officials were able to stop the bridge to traffic before it was struck, which certainly saved lives,” Biden stated during his remarks at the White House. Maryland Governor Wes Moore also stated that the crew’s prompt alert had saved lives. “We can confirm that the crew contacted authorities about a power outage. These individuals are heroes. We are grateful that between the Mayday and the collapse, officials were able to begin to halt the flow of cars. These individuals are heroes. Moore told AFP: “They saved lives last night.” \n             \n           Key Details Of Ship Collision Dali, a container ship, crashed with a pillar of the Francis Scott Key Bridge near Baltimore, Maryland, around 1:30 a.m. local time on March 26. The accident caused substantial damage, and the bridge collapsed into the Patapsco River. However, all traffic on the bridge was stopped in time when the vessel’s 22 crew sent a ‘mayday’ call to notify local authorities that they had lost power. The container ship’s “mayday” call before the collision triggered an immediate response from authorities, resulting in the evacuation of everyone on the bridge. This prompt response is credited with potentially saving lives. Potential Causalities  Six men of a bridge construction crew who were working at night are missing and feared dead. Attempts to locate their bodies are ongoing. The Synergy Marine Group reports that all 22 crew members, including the two pilots, are safe. Eight individuals from a construction crew fixing potholes on the bridge fell into the water, two of whom survived. Unfortunately, six people are currently unaccounted. Efforts to locate them will resume Wednesday morning, according to the Associated Press. According to diplomatic sources, the missing include people from Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico. According to the Associated Press, one of the identified persons is Honduran citizen Maynor Yassir Suazo Sandova. Cause Of Collision While the specific cause of the accident has still to be discovered, Moore acknowledged that the cargo ship had lost power prior to the incident. Both federal and state authorities have indicated that the incident was most likely an accident. The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting an inquiry, which has resulted in an indefinite halt of ship traffic entering and departing the Port of Baltimore. The Francis Scott Key Bridge is a vital transportation corridor that handles 31,000 cars per day, or 11.3 million vehicles per year. The route has been suspended, affecting both local and international shipping activities.",

        "text": "Representative Inage   \n         Tel Aviv:  Israel’s Ministry of Communications increased competition and “significantly and immediately” reduced the prices for using Bezeq’s (Israel’s national telephone company) infrastructure. \nThe ministry reduced companies’ “passive infrastructures” use fees of Bezeq from 446 Shekels ($122) per kilometre per month to only 250 Shekels (USD 70) per kilometre per month, a reduction of approximately 44 per cent.  \n             Why Prices Have Been Reduced? This is the first reduction in the series, and this price will be in effect until June 2025, when updated prices will take effect. The price reduction will come into effect on April 1, 2024. Bezeq is the only company in Israel that owns a physical communication infrastructure (channels, pipes, towers, poles, etc.) all over the State of Israel. The conditions of access to Bezeq’s physical infrastructure directly affect the ability and incentive of other telecommunications companies to set up independent infrastructures and compete with Bezeq in providing internet services to the public. \n             \n           Benefits Of Price Reduction In the current period, the State of Israel is spreading its length and breadth with advanced networks, therefore especially in this period it is important to reduce significantly and as quickly as possible the rates for the use of Bezeq’s passive infrastructure. Such a reduction is expected to increase the incentive of telecommunications companies to expand the retirement of their fibre infrastructures, and to promote competition, in a way that will affect the quality of the infrastructures in Israel and the well-being of the consumer in terms of quality and price for many years to come.",

        "text": "Demonstrators hold signs and wave flags during a pro-Palestinian rally in Brussels, Sunday, Jan 21, 2024. (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert)   \n         Tehran:  Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani has called on governments and international organisations to fulfill their “human, legal and historical responsibility” and take action to stop Israel’s “genocidal crime” against Palestinians in Gaza. He made the remarks on Thursday in a post on social media platform X, citing as proof of Israel’s “genocidal crime” in Gaza a report titled “Anatomy of a Genocide” presented to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva on Tuesday by Francesca Albanese, UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories as quoted by Xinhua news agency report.  \n             Israel’s “genocidal crime against the Palestinians has now been confirmed and asserted by the special rapporteur at the UNHRC,” Kanaani said, stressing, “Now governments and international political and legal assemblies and institutions are not only subject to the judgment of the world public opinion, but also to the judgment of history.” Condemning Israel’s attacks against medical centres in Gaza in another post on X on Wednesday, Kanaani said the war against hospitals in the Gaza Strip was a “tragic and painful part of the process of the war crimes” of the Israeli army against the people of the coastal enclave. He added official reports said that since the outbreak of the war against Gaza, Israel had made “33 hospitals completely unable to provide medical services”. \n             \n           A total of 32,552 Palestinians have been killed and more than 74,980 others were injured in the Gaza Strip since Israel began its offensive against Hamas on October 7, 2023, the Gaza-based Health Ministry said on Thursday.

        "description": "Responding to a question on China continuing to stake claim to Arunachal Pradesh, MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India's position on the matter has always been clear and will not change no matter how many times Beijing \"repeated its baseless claims\".",
        "text": "Stock image/Representational   \n         Arunachal Pradesh  “was, is and will always remain” an integral and inalienable part of  India  and no amount of repetition of its “baseless claims” by  China  can change our stance on the matter, India said Thursday while responding to Beijing reiterating its claim.  \n             “Beijing may repeat its baseless claims as many times as it wants but that is not going to change New Delhi’s position that Arunachal Pradesh was, is and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of the country,”  Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)  spokesperson  Randhir Jaiswal  told the media during his weekly press briefing. MEA’s response came days after Beijing repeated its claim over Arunachal Pradesh. India’s stance is clear Responding to a question on China continuing to stake claim to Arunachal Pradesh, Jaiswal said India’s position on the matter has always been clear and will not change no matter how many times Beijing “repeated its baseless claims”. \n             \n           “Our position on the matter, Arunachal Pradesh, has been made very clear, time and again. Recently also, we issued a statement in this regard. China may repeat its baseless claims as many times as they want, that is not going to change our position,” the MEA spokesperson said. “Arunachal Pradesh was, is and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India,” he asserted. On March 19, the MEA it had taken note of the comments made by the spokesperson of the Chinese Defence Ministry “advancing absurd claims” over the territory of Arunachal Pradesh and asserted that the state “was, is and will always be” an integral and inalienable part of India. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian on Monday reiterated China’s claim over the northeastern state. On a query on the visit of the Sri Lankan prime minister to Beijing, he said, “We monitor all developments that have an impact on our economic and security interests and we take necessary action that are required to be taken.” ‘Nothing new’: MEA on Trudeau’s Nijjar allegations Meanwhile, responding to a query about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau repeating his comments on allegations linked with killing of a Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil, Jaiswal said: “What Prime Minister Trudeau has said is nothing new” and reiterated that India is ready to investigate the matter. Recalling the comments made by his predecessor last September in a press briefing, Jaiswal said India was “ready to investigate any specific and concrete information if it shared with us. But, we are yet to receive any such information. We have also cautioned against playing politics and giving extremists more space”. On Gurpatwant Singh Pannun He was also asked about the Chinese foreign ministry’s comments related to the case of Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. “India and the United States, as two countries adhering to rule of law, are capable of dealing with any issues that we have between ourselves. There is no role for any speculative comments and gratuitous advice by unrelated third parties,” the MEA spokesperson said. The United States is working with the Indian government to hold accountable those behind a plot to kill Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun on American soil, according to the Biden administration. An Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, was charged by federal prosecutors in November last year in connection with his involvement in a foiled plot to assassinate Pannun, who holds dual citizenship of the US and Canada. India in favour of de-escalation in Gaza On the UN Security Council on March 25 passing a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza for the month of Ramzan, after more than five months since the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict, “We see that resolution as a positive development”, the MEA spokesperson said in response to a query. He said India has repeatedly called for “de-escalation and preventing the spread of the conflict”. “We have condemned terrorism, called for release of hostages, protection of civilians, and reiterated the need for safe and timely delivery of humanitarian assistance and aid to the people of Palestine. And, we also stand for a two-state solution,” Jaiswal said. (With PTI inputs)",

        "description": "Hamas has sought to parlay any deal into an end to the fighting and withdrawal of Israeli forces.",
        "text": "Israels' IDF questioned claims by the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza that several people had been killed in the explosion.   \n         Cairo:  Truce talks between Israel and Hamas will resume on Sunday in Cairo, the latest attempt to bring about a pa us e after nearly six months of war in the Gaza Strip, Egypt’s Al Qahera News TV reported on Saturday, citing a security source.  \n             An Israeli official told Reuters that Israel will send a delegation to Cairo on Sunday. A Hamas official, however, told Reuters that the group would wait to hear from Cairo mediators on the outcome of their talks with Israel first. The warring sides have stepped up negotiations, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, on a six-week s us pension of Israel’s offensive in return for the proposed release of 40 of the 130 hostages still held by the Palestinian militant group in Gaza. Hamas has sought to parlay any deal into an end to the fighting and withdrawal of Israeli forces. Israel has ruled this out, saying it would eventually resume efforts to dismantle the governance and military capabilities of Hamas. \n             \n           Hamas also wants hundreds of tho us ands of Palestinians who fled Gaza City and surrounding areas southward during the first stage of the war to be allowed back north. One Israeli official said his country was open to disc us sing allowing back only “some” of the displaced. More than 32,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s military offensive in the Gaza Strip since Oct. 7, according to health authorities in the territory. The war erupted after Hamas militants broke through the border and rampaged through communities in southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and abducting 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel kept up its aerial and ground bombardment of the Gaza Strip on Friday, killing 82 Palestinians in the past 24 hours, the territory’s health ministry said as fighting raged around Gaza City’s main Al Shifa hospital. The ministry added that Israeli forces in control of the hospital had blockaded 107 patients in the human resources department without water, electricity, or medication for several days, ref us ing all calls to evacuate them. Armed wings of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad said their fighters continued to battle Israeli forces around the medical facility, the Gaza Strip’s biggest hospital before the war, which had been one of the few healthcare facilities even partially operational in north Gaza before the latest fighting. The Israeli military said forces operating in Al Shifa killed three armed Hamas commanders inside two buildings of the medical facility. Forces located sniper rifles, AK-47s, magazines, and grenades during the activity, the military said. Israel said it killed and detained hundreds of Hamas and Islamic Jihad gunmen at Al Shifa during its raid there. Hamas and medical staffers deny any armed presence inside medical facilities, acc us ing Israel of killing and arresting civilians.",

        "title": "Israel-Hamas War: Biden Admin Greenlights Fresh Arsenal Of 2000-Pound Bombs, Warplanes To Israel",
        "description": "Amid talks of a potential Israeli military offensive in southern Gaza, the United States has greenlighted a large cache of fresh munitions to Israel, including the 2000-pound MK84 bombs and fighter jets.",
        "text": "Israeli Forces Kill Over 70 Palestinians in Gaza City In 'Planned Massacre': Official\n   \n         Israel-Hamas War:  The United States has approved fresh sales of warplanes and bombs to Israel amid rising concerns over the latter’s potential military offensive in southern Gaza, a media report said. According to the Washington Post, the Biden administration has quietly sanctioned the transfer of billions of dollars of bombs and fighter jets to Jerusalem despite escalating tensions and apprehensions about the impact of these arms sales by the US on Palestinian civilians.  \n             Brushing aside the concerns raised by various quarters, Washington has proceeded with the arms packages, signalling its unwavering support for Israel’s defence strategies, the report said. Concerns over Israeli offensive in southern Gaza As per the report, the recent approval include a substantial arsenal of munitions, comprising over 1,800 MK84 2,000-pound bombs and 500 MK82 500-pound bombs. This was confirmed by Pentagon and State Department officials familiar with the matter. The decision to greenlight such significant weaponry raises eyebrows, particularly given the lethal history of the 2,000-pound bombs in previous Israeli military campaigns in Gaza, which have resulted in mass casualties, the report by The Washington Post said. \n             \n           Despite the Biden administration expressing concerns about the potential ramifications of an Israeli offensive in southern Gaza, it has refrained from conditioning aid or imposing restrictions on arms transfers. A White House official reiterated the administration’s stance, affirming its continued support for Israel’s right to self-defence and emphasising that conditioning aid has not been part of its policy. US-Israel ties at an impasse However, some Democratic voices, including allies of President Biden, argue for a more nuanced approach, insisting on Israeli commitments to minimise civilian casualties and facilitate humanitarian aid into Gaza. Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland urged the Biden administration to leverage its influence effectively, demanding assurances from Israel before approving further arms transfers to Gaza. The impasse highlights the delicate balance in US-Israel relations, with disagreements emerging over the conduct of the conflict. While the Biden administration seeks to engage with Israeli authorities to mitigate the bloodshed, tensions have flared over the refusal to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a temporary ceasefire, which Israel perceived as undermining its position. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant’s recent visit to Washington underscored Israel’s urgent requests for expedited weaponry, with Gen Charles Q Brown Jr, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledging Israel’s persistent demands for critical military supplies. However, the US has exercised discretion in fulfilling these requests, citing capacity limits and strategic considerations. Biden admin faces criticism over arms transfers to Israel The decision to proceed with arms transfers has drawn criticism from some quarters, with concerns raised about the moral implications and potential complicity in Israel’s military actions. Critics argue that the indiscriminate use of powerful munitions, such as the MK84 bombs, poses significant risks to civilian populations and may constitute violations of international law, according to The Washington Post. The Biden administration’s approach has also sparked internal debate, with advocates defending the need to maintain robust support for Israel’s security while acknowledging the humanitarian imperative of minimising civilian harm. Efforts to engage with Israeli officials behind the scenes have yielded mixed results, with delays in planned military operations in Gaza attributed partly to ongoing discussions. US humanitarian aid in Gaza and the challenges galore Despite the diplomatic tensions, the Biden administration remains committed to facilitating humanitarian assistance to alleviate the dire conditions in Gaza. However, logistical challenges and Israeli restrictions on aid deliveries have hindered efforts to address the humanitarian crisis effectively. In navigating the complexities of the conflict, the Biden administration faces mounting pressure to reconcile its support for Israel’s security with its humanitarian obligations and concerns about civilian welfare. The delicate balancing act underscores the broader challenges of US foreign policy in the Middle East, where geopolitical interests intersect with moral imperatives. As the situation in Gaza remains volatile, the Biden administration confronts a daunting task in reconciling competing priorities and upholding its commitments to both Israel’s security and the well-being of Palestinian civilians, the report added.

        "description": "Egypt fears a mass influx of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees who may never be allowed to return.",
        "text": "People block a highway during a protest to demand the release of the hostages taken by Hamas militants into the Gaza Strip during the Oct. 7th attack, in Tel Aviv, Israel, Saturday, Feb. 10, 2024. (AP Photo/Ariel Schalit)   \n         RAFAH, Gaza Strip:  Egypt is threatening to suspend its peace treaty with Israel if Israeli troops are sent into the densely populated Gaza border town of Rafah, where it fears fighting could force the closure of the besieged territory’s main aid supply route, two Egyptian officials and a Western diplomat said Sunday.  \n             The threat to suspend the Camp David Accords, a cornerstone of regional stability for nearly a half-century, came after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said sending troops into Rafah was necessary to win the four-month war against the Palestinian militant group Hamas. He said Hamas still has four battalions there. Over half of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have fled to Rafah to escape fighting in other areas, and they are packed into sprawling tent camps and U.N.-run shelters near the border. Egypt fears a mass influx of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees who may never be allowed to return. Netanyahu told “Fox News Sunday” that there’s “plenty of room north of Rafah for them to go to” after Israel’s offensive elsewhere in Gaza, and said Israel would direct evacuees with “flyers, with cellphones and with safe corridors and other things.” \n             \n           The standoff between Israel and Egypt, two close U.S. allies, took shape as aid groups warned that an offensive in Rafah would worsen the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza, where around 80% of residents have fled their homes and where the U.N. says a quarter of the population faces starvation. A ground operation in Rafah could cut off one of the only avenues for delivering Gaza’s badly needed food and medical supplies. Hamas’ Al-Aqsa television station quoted an unnamed Hamas official as saying that any invasion of Rafah would “blow up” talks mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar aimed at achieving a cease-fire and the release of Israeli hostages. U.S. President Joe Biden and Netanyahu were expected to speak later Sunday, according to two administration officials with knowledge of the call who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the president’s private discussions. Biden last week called Israel’s military response in Gaza “over the top.” WHERE WOULD CIVILIANS GO? All three officials confirmed Egypt’s threats, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters on the sensitive negotiations. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and other countries have also warned of severe repercussions if Israel goes into Rafah. “An Israeli offensive on Rafah would lead to an unspeakable humanitarian catastrophe and grave tensions with Egypt,” European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell wrote on X. Human Rights Watch said in a statement that forced displacement is a war crime and that civilians who don’t evacuate are still protected by international humanitarian law. “There is nowhere safe to go in Gaza,” refugee and migrant rights researcher Nadia Hardman said. The White House, which has rushed arms to Israel and shielded it from international calls for a cease-fire, has also warned against a Rafah ground operation under current circumstances, saying it would be a “disaster” for civilians. Israel and Egypt fought five wars before signing the Camp David Accords, a landmark peace treaty brokered by then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s. The treaty includes several provisions governing the deployment of forces on both sides of the border. Egypt has heavily fortified its border with Gaza, carving out a 5-kilometer (3-mile) buffer zone and erecting concrete walls above and below ground. It has denied Israeli allegations that Hamas operates smuggling tunnels beneath the border, saying Egyptian forces have full control on their side. Egyptian officials fear that if the border is breached, the military would be unable to stop a tide of people fleeing into the Sinai Peninsula. The United Nations says Rafah, normally home to fewer than 300,000 people, now hosts 1.4 million more who fled fighting elsewhere, and it is “severely overcrowded.” Inside Rafah, some displaced people packed up again. Rafat and Fedaa Abu Haloub, who fled Beit Lahia in the north earlier in the war, placed their belongings on the back of a truck. “We don’t know where we can safely take him,” Fedaa said of their baby. “Every month we have to move, and with all the fear and missiles.” An Israeli ground invasion of Rafah may force Palestinians in Gaza to flee to Egypt, Om Mohammad Al-Ghemry said, and she hoped that Egyptians would “open the borders and let us flee to Sinai.” 112 BODIES TAKEN TO GAZA HOSPITALS IN A DAY Israel has ordered much of Gaza’s population to flee south, with evacuation orders covering two-thirds of the territory, even as it regularly carries out airstrikes in all areas, including Rafah. Airstrikes on the town in recent days have killed dozens of Palestinians, including women and children. Israel’s offensive has caused widespread destruction, particularly in northern Gaza, and heavy fighting continues in central Gaza and the southern city of Khan Younis. In Gaza City on Sunday, remaining residents covered decomposing bodies in the streets or carried bodies to graves. Some streets were piled high with sand from bombings. Gaza’s Health Ministry said Sunday that the bodies of 112 people killed across the territory had been brought to hospitals in the past 24 hours, as well as 173 wounded people. The fatalities brought the death toll in the strip to 28,176 since the start of the war. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and fighters but says most of those killed were women and children. The war began with Hamas’ attack into southern Israel on Oct. 7, when Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Over 100 hostages were released in November during a weeklong cease-fire in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners. Some of the remaining hostages have died. Hamas has said it won’t release any more unless Israel ends its offensive and withdraws from Gaza. It has also demanded the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including senior militants serving life sentences. Netanyahu has ruled out both demands, saying Israel will fight on until “total victory” and the return of all the hostages.",

        "title": "Indonesian Defense Chief Linked To Past Rights Abuses Claims Victory In Presidential Election",
        "description": "According to the unofficial tallies conducted by Indonesian polling agencies, Subianto had between 57% and 59% of votes, with more than 80% of the vote counted in polling places sampled.",
        "text": "Indonesian presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto displays a victory symbol after casting his vote in Bojong Koneng, Indonesia, Wednesday, Feb. 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Vincent Thian)   \n         JAKARTA, Indonesia:  Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto, an ex-general linked to past human rights atrocities, claimed victory in Indonesia’s presidential election on Wednesday based on unofficial tallies.  \n             The 72-year-old candidate, who was once banned by the United States from entering for two decades due to his human rights record, told thousands of supporters in a sports stadium in the capital, Jakarta, that the victory, according to an early, unofficial “quick count,” was “the victory of all Indonesians.” There was no declaration by electoral officials and the two former provincial governors who also contested the election in the world’s third-largest democracy have not conceded defeat. Subianto was an army general during the brutal period of the Suharto dictatorship that ended just over 25 years ago. He served as a special forces commander in a unit linked to torture and disappearances, allegations that he vehemently denies. \n             \n           According to the unofficial tallies conducted by Indonesian polling agencies, Subianto had between 57% and 59% of votes, with more than 80% of the vote counted in polling places sampled. The quick counts are based on the actual vote count at a sample of polling stations across Indonesia. The laborious official count may not be finished for up to a month, but quick counts have provided an accurate picture of the results of all four presidential elections held in Indonesia since it began direct voting in 2004. “We are grateful for the quick count results,” he said in the speech, broadcast on national television. “We should not be arrogant, we should not be proud, we should not be euphoric, we still have to be humble, this victory must be a victory for all Indonesian people.” To avoid a runoff against his rivals, Anies Baswedan and Ganjar Pranowo, Subianto needs more than 50% of all votes cast and at least 20% in each of the country’s provinces. Subianto has presented himself as an heir to immensely popular sitting President Joko Widodo, whose son he chose as his running mate. Widodo’s successor will inherit an economy with impressive growth and ambitious infrastructure projects, including the ongoing transfer of the nation’s capital from congested Jakarta to the frontier island of Borneo at a staggering cost exceeding $30 billion. The election also has high stakes for the United States and China, since Indonesia has a huge domestic market, natural resources like nickel and palm oil, and diplomatic influence with its Southeast Asian neighbors. Widodo’s rise from a riverside slum to the presidency has shown the vibrancy of Indonesia’s democracy in a region rife with authoritarian regimes. But with a leading candidate linked to a former dictator, and Widodo’s son on the ballot, some observers fear that democracy is eroding. Indonesians voted on Wednesday in an election that took just six hours. The logistics of the vote across the tropical nation’s 17,000 islands inhabited by 270 million people were daunting: Ballot boxes and ballots were transported by boats, motorcycles, horses and on foot in some of the more far-flung locations. Aside from the presidency, some 20,000 national, provincial and district parliamentary posts were contested by tens of thousands of candidates in one of the world’s largest elections, which authorities said concluded with no major problems. About 10,000 aspirants from 18 political parties eyed the national parliament’s 580 seats alone. Voters interviewed by The Associated Press expressed hope their next leader would help them achieve greater prosperity in a country where nearly a tenth of the population still lives in poverty. “I hope Indonesia can progress better and that I did not vote for the wrong person,” said Indra Nurohim, a 17-year-old high school student and first-time voter. “I hope we will have a better government.” Subianto, the oldest presidential candidate at 72, lost in two previous runs to Widodo but was the front-runner in independent surveys. His running mate, Widodo’s eldest son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, was allowed to run when the Constitutional Court made an exception to the minimum age requirement of 40. The court was then headed by Widodo’s brother-in-law, who was removed by an ethics panel for not recusing himself, and Widodo was accused of favoritism and nepotism. Critics have accused Widodo of trying to build a political dynasty despite his being the first president to emerge from outside the political and military elite since the 1998 end of the dictatorial rule of Suharto, characterized by widespread human rights violations, plunder and political unrest. Subianto, a former lieutenant general who married one of Suharto’s daughters, was a longtime commander in the army special forces, called Kopassus. He was dishonorably discharged in 1998 after Kopassus forces kidnapped and tortured political opponents of Suharto. Of at least 22 activists kidnapped that year, 13 remain missing to this day, and their families protest weekly outside the presidential palace demanding the activists be accounted for. Subianto never faced a trial and denied any involvement, although several of his men were tried and convicted. During the campaign period that concluded last weekend, Subianto and his strategists used AI and social media platforms like TikTok to soften his image by portraying him as a cuddly grandfather to his youthful running mate. Rejected by human rights activists, he danced on the campaign stage and promised to generate nearly 20 million jobs in his first term if elected. Baswedan, the former head of an Islamic university, served as governor of Jakarta until last year. A former Fulbright scholar, Baswedan was education and culture minister from 2014 to 2016, when Widodo removed him from the Cabinet after accusing him of failing to address problems of thousands of students affected by forest fires. Baswedan opposes Widodo’s plan to move the Indonesian capital from Jakarta to Nusantara on Borneo island, which involves constructing government buildings and residential enclaves by clearing lush tropical rainforests. In an interview with the AP last month, he said democracy in Indonesia is under threat, given Subianto’s choice of the president’s son as running mate. “This means that there is a decline in trust, it means that our democracy is experiencing a decline in quality, it means that many legal rules are being bent,” he said. Pranowo is the governing party candidate but does not have Widodo’s support. He was a national legislator for the ruling Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle for 10 years before being elected in 2013 for the first of two terms as governor of the vote-rich Central Java region. While governor, Pranowo refused to allow Israel to participate in the Under-20 FIFA World Cup to be held in his province. FIFA subsequently dropped Indonesia as host of the games, angering Indonesian soccer fans and Widodo. Israel and Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, do not have diplomatic ties. Under Widodo, Indonesia saw a period of remarkable growth averaging 5% annually, except in 2020, when the economy contracted due to the coronavirus pandemic. His economic roadmap, called “Golden Indonesia 2045,” projects Indonesia becoming one of the world’s top five economies with GDP of up to $9 trillion, exactly a century after it won independence from Dutch colonizers.",

        "text": "Image tweeted by @PMOIndia   \n         Prime Minister Narendra Modi  on Thursday thanked  Qatari Emir  Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani for the release of eight Indians, previously on death row, even as the two leaders held extensive talks that set the stage for taking the bilateral ties to a higher level, especially in the spheres of investment, energy and new technology.  \n             After the talks at the majestic Amiri Palace in this Qatari capital city, Modi described his meeting with the Emir as “wonderful” and said the bilateral ties are growing “stronger and stronger” and both the nations are looking forward to collaborating in futuristic sectors that will benefit the planet. \n VIDEO | PM Modi holds bilateral meeting with Qatar's Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in Doha.  pic.twitter.com/UMo75jitso \n — Press Trust of India (@PTI_News)  February 15, 2024 Modi arrived here last night from the United Arab Emirates in his second visit to Qatar which came days after Doha released the Indians in a major relief to New Delhi. \n             \n           Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra said at a media briefing that the talks focused on expanding cooperation in key areas, increasing convergence on regional issues, examining partnership in third countries, and viewing the overall ties from a strategic perspective rather than a transactional one. The two leaders also spoke about the need for strategic investments and strategic partnerships in the domain of energy and to proceed beyond the buyer-seller relationship in this field. Prime Minister Modi also thanked the Emir for his support for the welfare of the Indian community in the Gulf nation, he said. “The prime minister thanked the Emir for his support for the welfare of the Indian community, and in this regard, expressed his deep appreciation to the Emir for the release of eight Indian nationals of Al-Dahra company. We are extremely gratified to see them back in India,” Kwatra said. Seven out of eight Indians had returned to India on Monday after Qatar freed them. The Navy veterans were on October 26 given death sentences by Qatar’s Court of First Instance. The Court of Appeal in the Gulf nation on December 28 commuted the capital punishment and sentenced them to jail terms for varying durations. The former Indian Navy personnel apparently faced charges of espionage, but neither the Qatari authorities nor New Delhi made the charges against them public. Kwatra said Modi’s “very successful visit” has set the stage for taking ties to a much higher level in a range of areas and exploring engagement in new areas such as space, technology and innovation. “Had a wonderful meeting with HH Sheikh @TamimBinHamad. We reviewed the full range of India-Qatar relations and discussed ways to deepen cooperation across various sectors. Our nations also look forward to collaborating in futuristic sectors which will benefit our planet,” Modi said on ‘X’. “My visit to Qatar has added new vigour to the India-Qatar friendship. India looks forward to scaling up cooperation in key sectors relating to trade, investment, technology and culture. I thank the Government and people of Qatar for their hospitality,” he said. “India and Qatar ties are growing stronger and stronger!,” Modi said in another post along with photographs of the ceremonial welcome accorded to him in Doha. Modi was accorded a ceremonial welcome at the Amiri Palace on his arrival this morning. Thereafter, both sides held delegation-level and restricted talks. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said the Modi-Hamad discussions covered a wide array of topics including economic cooperation, investments, energy partnership, space collaboration, urban infrastructure, cultural bonds and people-to-people ties. \nIt said the two leaders also exchanged views on regional and global issues. It is understood that the situation in Gaza figured in the talks. “The prime minister thanked the Amir for taking care of the over eight lakh strong Indian community in Qatar and conveyed India’s commitment to further expanding and deepening bilateral cooperation with Qatar. He invited Amir to pay an early visit to India,” the MEA said in a statement. It said the Emir reciprocated Modi’s sentiments and expressed appreciation for India’s role as a valued partner in the Gulf region. The MEA said the Emir also appreciated the contributions of the vibrant Indian community in Qatar’s development and their enthusiastic participation in various international events held in Qatar. The talks were followed by a banquet lunch at the Amiri Palace hosted in honour of Modi. In his remarks, Kwatra said the prime minister’s visit to Qatar was focused on consolidating the wide-ranging partnership in different fields of economic cooperation and build on the gains of his 2016 visit to the country with an overarching emphasis on what the two countries can achieve in future. He said both sides have strong energy security and partnership but the endeavour now would be to look at the cooperation from a strategic point of view that would include renewables, green energy, supply chains in clean energy, technology and innovations in energy space, not just pure energy trade. Kwatra said the aim would be to broaden the trade basket and to build new trade markets considering regional trade. Modi also met with Qatar’s father Emir and congratulated him on his visionary leadership that paved the way for Qatar’s development in past decades and laid a strong foundation for the India-Qatar partnership, Kwatra said. Father Emir affirmed India and Qatar share an unwavering bond epitomised by mutual trust and cooperation, Kwatra said. The father Emir also appreciated the Indian community’s role in the development and nourishing of bilateral partnership. Shortly after he arrived in Doha last night, Modi met Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. Abdulrahman is Qatar’s foreign minister as well. \nThe trade and energy ties between India and Qatar are on an upswing. Qatar is the largest supplier of LNG to India, accounting for over 48 per cent of India’s global LNG imports. India’s Petronet has renewed a contract to buy 7.5 million tonnes of LNG from Qatar annually from 2029 for 20 years and it is being billed as the largest-ever extension of super-chilled fuel in the world. The original 25-year deal was signed in 1999 and supplies started in 2004. \nIndia-Qatar cooperation has been steadily growing in diverse sectors over the last few years. Prime Minister Modi paid his first visit to Doha in June, 2016. The visit provided an opportunity for both sides to engage at the highest level, and impart fresh momentum to the bilateral ties. It was the highest-level visit from India to Qatar since the visit of then prime minister Manmohan Singh in November 2008. (Only the headline has been reworked by India.Com staff.

        "text": "Joe Biden said that he would not cut off weapons like the Iron Dome missile interceptors, which are crucial for protecting Israeli civilians from rocket attacks.   \n         Washington:  US President  Joe Biden  on Friday reacted to the reported death of  Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny , stating that he was ‘not surprised’ but ‘outraged’. “He bravely stood up to the corruption, the  violence  and all the bad things the  Putin  government was doing. Putin is responsible for Navalny’s death,” Biden said at the White House. Russian opposition leader Navalny died after losing consciousness at the penal colony north of the Arctic Circle on Friday. He was serving a jail term at the prison. The 47-year-old was one of the most famous opposition leaders in Russia and he rose to prominence by lampooning the elite class and raising allegations of corruption on a vast scale.  \n             Notably, the White House was seeking details about Navalny’s death at the prison, where he was taken less than two months ago. Bitter US-Russian Relations However, Biden’s remarks has put a further chill into already bitter US-Russian relations. \n             \n           The 47-year-old Navalny had been a vocal critic of the Russian President, and President Biden had stated after meeting Putin in Geneva in 2021 that Nalvany’s death would risk devastating consequences for him. Notably, the relationship between Biden and Putin remains tense over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Biden is continuously requesting Republicans in the US Congress to support additional funding for more weaponry for Ukraine. Biden’s Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, slammed him last week by saying he would do nothing to defend NATO allies from Russia unless they paid a major share for the common defenses. The leading Republican in the House of Representatives, Speaker Mike Johnson, has refrained from bringing a Senate bill for additional funding for Ukraine to a vote. Following Navalny’s death, he expressed the opinion that the United States and its allies should employ “every means available to cut off Putin’s ability to fund his unprovoked war in Ukraine and aggression against the Baltic states.” In Munich for a crucial security conference, Vice President Kamala Harris assured that US would never retreat from its NATO alliance obligations put in place after World War Two. She also met with Alexei Navalny’s wife Yulia and expressed her sorrow and outrage over reports of her husband’s death.",

        "description": "Surpassing the plan of US and various other Arab countries to simulate peace between Israel and Palestine, by providing statehood to Palestine, the cabinet of Israel unanimously rejected the plan of providing statehood to Palestine.",
        "text": "Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu   \n         Tel Aviv:  Further showcasing the growing friction between the US and Israel, the Israeli cabinet unanimously approved a declaration strongly opposing any plan for Palestinian statehood, the Times of Israel reported. \nThis comes in the wake of reports that the US and several Arab partners were preparing a detailed plan for a comprehensive peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians that includes a “firm timeline” for a Palestinian state. \n“Israel utterly rejects international diktats regarding a permanent settlement with the Palestinians,” the cabinet decision read. “A settlement, if it is to be reached, will come about solely through direct negotiations between the parties, without preconditions.” \n“Israel will continue to oppose unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state,” the motion added. “Such recognition in the wake of the October 7 massacre would be a massive and unprecedented reward to terrorism and would foil any future peace settlement.” \nResponding to this, a US State Department spokesperson said that the best way to achieve an enduring end to the crisis in Gaza that provides “lasting peace and security” for Israelis and Palestinians alike, is our strong commitment to the “creation of a Palestinian state,” Times of Israel reported. \n“As such, the US continues to support the two-state solution and to oppose policies that endanger its viability or contradict our mutual interests and values,” it added. \nThe Israeli cabinet statement echoed comments made by Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu in response to a Washington Post report on the matter. \nThe Washington Post reported that the timing for announcing the blueprint was largely dependent on Israel and Hamas being able to reach a deal pausing the fighting in Gaza. \nMembers of Netanyahu’s Likud party and ministers on the right flank of his coalition publicly blasted the report. One Likud minister even called for Israel to threaten in response to cancel the Oslo Accords that created the Palestinian Authority. But, Sunday’s statement was also approved by the centrist members of the emergency government, including ministers Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot. \nThe ongoing war was sparked by the Hamas terror attack on October 7, which saw thousands of terrorists break through the border, kill around 1,200 people and take over 250 hostages, amid horrific acts of brutality including sexual assault. \nThe proposed plan includes moves that Israel has previously refused, including the evacuation of many West Bank settlements and the establishment of a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem. It would also see a combined security apparatus and government for the West Bank and Gaza. \nSaudi officials have publicly acknowledged their willingness to normalize relations with Israel, even after October 7, but they have stressed — as has the US — that no deal can be reached until there is a ceasefire in Gaza and that it must include the creation of an irreversible pathway toward a Palestinian state. \nIn the past as well, Netanyahu has spoken out against the creation of a Palestinian state. While some international actors believe the violence only underlines the need for a peace deal, Israeli leaders argue the attack highlighted the “extreme danger” of an autonomous Palestinian entity near its population centres. \nThe Israeli leaders also said that amid “soaring support for Hamas” among Palestinians in the wake of the atrocities, there appears to be little appetite in the Israeli public for peace efforts, the Times of Israel reported. \nEarlier, Netanyahu refuted calls by world leaders to avoid a ground operation in Rafah and said that doing so would mean “losing the war against Hamas,” as reported by The Times of Israel. \n“Those who want to prevent us from operating in Rafah are essentially telling us: ‘Lose the war.’ I won’t let that happen,” he vowed at an evening press conference in Jerusalem. “We won’t capitulate to any pressure,” he said. \nAccording to The Times of Israel, Rafah, located on the Gaza-Egypt border, is the final remaining Hamas stronghold in the territory, but it also houses over a million displaced Palestinians sheltering from war.  \n             (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by India.com staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "'Holocaust', Says Brazilian President On Gaza Operations; Israel Says 'Red Line' Crossed   \n         Tel Aviv:  Amid the ongoing conflict between the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and Hamas militants, Brazilian President Lula da Silva made remarks that offended Israel. On Sunday, Silva compared IDF’s operations in the Gaza Strip to the ‘Holocaust’ against the Palestinian people. Tel Aviv, responding to the Brazilian President’s comments, deemed it “shameful,” Times of Israel reported. President Lula asserted that Israel is committing ‘genocide’ against the people of Palestine in the conflicted Strip. He added that this could only be compared to “when Hitler decided to kill the Jews.”  \n             “What’s happening in the Gaza Strip isn’t a war, it’s a genocide,” Lula told reporters in Addis Ababa, where he was attending an African Union summit. “It’s not a war of soldiers against soldiers. It’s a war between a highly prepared army and women and children.” “What is happening in the Gaza Strip with the Palestinian people hasn’t happened at any other moment in history” except one: “When Hitler decided to kill the Jews,” Lula added. \nIsrael Responded To President Lula’s Remark Israel responded with outrage and termed President Lula’s remark as “shameful”, stating that country’s ambassador would be summoned for a “stern reprimand.” \n             \n           Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu responded stringently and said the Brazilian leader had “crossed a red line.” “The words of the President of Brazil are shameful and alarming,” Times of Israel quoted Netanyahu as saying in a statement. \n“This is a trivialization of the Holocaust and an attempt to harm the Jewish people and Israel’s right to defend itself,” Netanyahu said. “Israel is fighting for its defence and securing its future until complete victory and it does so while upholding international law.” \nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz called the comments “shameful and grave.” “No one will harm Israel’s right to defend itself,” he said. Opposition leader Yair Lapid said Lula’s comments “show ignorance and antisemitism” and that Israel was “broken-hearted and shocked by the massacre of its citizens” on October 7. “I wonder what Lula would have said if a terrorist organization had harmed Brazil that way,” he added. “Shame.” \nIsrael’s announced a war against Hamas on October 7, following an unprecedented terror attack that killed as many as 1,200 people, and kidnapping over 250 people amid acts of brutality including sexual violence. Israel has stated that civilian casualties are a repercussion of combatants operating from behind the cover of innocents. The country emphasizes its efforts to minimize the deaths of Gazan civilians, as reported by the Times of Israel.",

        "text": "Representative Image   \n         The Hague (Netherlands):  The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is preparing to commence historic hearings on the legality of Israel’s 57-year occupation of Palestinian territories. Scheduled for a week at The Hague, the proceedings coincide with Israel’s ongoing military offensive in Gaza, resulting in the deaths of over 29,000 Palestinians since October 7, Al Jazeera reported.  \n             Distinct from the genocide complaint filed by South Africa against Israel for alleged violations in the current conflict, the ICJ hearings focus on Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem since 1967. \nThe Palestinians, seeking these areas for an independent state, argue that the occupation breaches three fundamental principles of international law, as reported by Al Jazeera. Palestinian representatives assert that Israel has violated the prohibition on territorial conquest by annexing significant portions of occupied land, infringing upon the Palestinians’ right to self-determination, and imposing a system of racial discrimination and apartheid. Omar Awadallah, head of the UN organisations department in the Palestinian Foreign Ministry, emphasises the desire for the court to consider the term “apartheid,” similar to its evaluation of “genocide” in the South Africa case. \nAn advisory opinion from the court is anticipated to provide the Palestinians with legal tools to address the alleged illegalities of the occupation through peaceful international law methods. The court’s ruling is expected to take months. \n             \n           Following the Palestinian presentation, an unprecedented 51 countries and three organisations—the League of Arab States, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and the African Union—will address the judges. While Israel will not present an oral argument, it has submitted written observations. The case reached the ICJ after the UN General Assembly voted in December 2022 to seek a non-binding advisory opinion on the Israeli occupation from the 15-judge panel. This request, championed by Palestinians and contested by Israel, prompted strong objections from the latter, which deemed any potential decision from the court as “completely illegitimate.” Israel captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza in 1967 during a war with Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. While Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, it still controls the enclave’s borders. In the West Bank, 146 settlements house over 500,000 Jewish settlers, with settler population growth exceeding 15 percent in the last five years, according to Peace Now. Israel has also annexed East Jerusalem, considering the entire city its capital. The international community widely regards the settlements as illegal, and Israel’s annexation of East Jerusalem is not internationally recognised. This case marks the second time the UN General Assembly has sought an advisory opinion from the ICJ on the occupied Palestinian territory, following a 2004 ruling that declared Israel’s separation wall in the West Bank violated international law, Al Jazeera reported.",

        "text": "Two Air Strikes Hit Southern Lebanon, Witnesses Say Heard Several Loud Booms, Saw Thick Black Columns Of Smoke    \n         The coastal Lebanese town of Ghaziyeh was rocked by at least two air strikes on Monday (local time), as witnesses reported hearing loud booms and seeing thick black columns of smoke rising from the area. The strikes, which occurred near the port city of Sidon, were attributed to the Israeli military’s targeting of weapons depots. The proximity of Ghaziyeh to Sidon is (37 miles) north of the border with Israel.  \n             According to Lebanese state media, the strikes were confirmed to be Israeli, with reports indicating that a car was among the targets hit. Lebanese security sources revealed that the air strikes targeted factories and warehouses in an industrial area south of Sidon. However, the exact nature of the targets remained unclear. The strikes resulted in injuries, with at least 14 individuals, primarily Syrian workers, reported to have been hurt. Israeli’s chief military spokesperson justified the air strikes as a response to a drone launched into Israel by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have escalated in the border area of south Lebanon, with both sides engaging in air strikes and rocket attacks. Israel’s rare strikes further north of the frontier zone have resulted in the deaths of over 170 Hezbollah fighters and nearly three dozen civilians, according to reports. \n             \n           More than 170 Hezbollah fighters and nearly three dozen civilians have been killed in Israeli strikes on Lebanon since Hezbollah launched rockets onto Israel in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas, according to Hezbollah’s announced figures and a Reuters count of civilian deaths . Hamas fighters launched an attack on Israel on Oct. 7 in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage into the Gaza Strip, according to Israeli figures. Israel’s air, land and sea bombardment of Gaza has killed more than 28,000 people since then, Palestinian health officials say. Last week, two sets of Israeli strikes on southern Lebanon killed 10 civilians and several Hezbollah fighters, including a commander in the group’s elite Radwan force. Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said Israel would pay “in blood” for the killings of civilians. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said Lebanon would “pay a heavy price” if diplomatic means failed to remove Hezbollah from the border zone. (With inputs from Reuters)",

        "description": "According to the text of the US-proposed draft, the US is calling for a \"temporary ceasefire in Gaza as soon as practicable,\" which falls short of the wishes of most other Security Council members who want an 'immediate' ceasefire.",
        "text": "Joe Biden told reporters at the White House that he's had \"extensive conversations\" with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu over the last several days   \n         Washington:  The United States has proposed a UN Security Council draft resolution calling for a temporary ceasefire in Israel’s war against Hamas and warning against an Israeli ground incursion into Rafah, CNN reported. Notably, Israel is planning to carry out a ground operation in Rafah, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have fled over the course of the conflict.  \n             The US draft comes after it vowed to veto an Algerian draft proposal calling for an immediate ceasefire. The Council will vote on the Algerian draft Tuesday morning. According to the text of the US-proposed draft, the US is calling for a “temporary ceasefire in Gaza as soon as practicable,” which falls short of the wishes of most other Security Council members who want an ‘immediate’ ceasefire. The US, which has traditionally protected its ally Israel from UN actions, has repeatedly resisted calls for a “ceasefire,” emphasizing what it claims is Israel’s right to defend itself following Hamas’ terror attack on October 7, CNN reported. It has also voted against at least two Security Council resolutions on the war. \n             \n           Earlier on Friday, President Joe Biden told reporters at the White House that he’s had “extensive conversations” with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu over the last several days, where he relayed his position “that there has to be a temporary ceasefire” to secure the safe release of hostages still held by Hamas. The US draft also warns of the effects of an Israeli ground offensive into Rafah, saying it would “result in further harm to civilians and their further displacement, including potentially into neighbouring countries, which would have serious implications for regional peace and security.” However, despite international pressure, Israel has said it plans to expand its ground operations into Rafah as part of its goal to destroy Hamas after the October 7 attacks. Many fear that military action in the refugee tent city could spark an exodus and result in the deaths of thousands of civilians. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has grown more vocal in expressing concerns over how Israel is conducting the war. Last week, Biden told Netanyahu that the military action “should not proceed,” according to a readout of their call. The US draft, which also calls for the release of Israeli hostages, will be privately discussed on Tuesday. It is unclear when it will be put to a vote, which will need more than nine votes in favour and no vetoes from the permanent members to pass, CNN reported.",

Herzi Halevi. Remarks From Top Military Officials “In the name of learning, we have the duty to investigate. This is a necessity and not a privilege. Only then will we be able to understand in what way we could have acted and in what way we will act in the future to better protect the citizens of Israel. Each unit and each force will investigate the battles and the events in which they participated and up the chain of command we will investigate level by level.” Hamas Invasion  At least 1,200 people were killed and 240 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the remaining 134 hostages, Israel recently declared 31 of them dead. More Jews were killed on that day than on any single day since the Holocaust. \n             \n           Internal Investigations In January, Halevi selected a team of investigators to lead the inquiry. Members of the team include former Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz, former Military Intelligence Directorate head Aharon Ze’evi-Farkash, former Southern Command leader Sami Turgeman and former Operations Directorate chief Yoav Har-Even. The inquiry will investigate the IDF General Staff, military intelligence, the deficiencies of the Gaza border defenses and general operational matters. Its mandate does not include decisions made by the political echelon. \nA separate independent commission of inquiry with a broader mandate including political failures is expected to take place after the war.",

        "description": "The Sindh High Court (SHC) has directed the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to restore the services of social media platform X (formerly Twitter) throughout Pakistan and has requested detailed responses from the respondents in the upcoming hearing.",
        "text": "SHC directes the PTA to fully restore services of X    \n         Karachi:  In a significant development, the Sindh High Court (SHC) has directed the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to completely restore the services of social media platform X (formerly Twitter) throughout the country, as reported by Dawn.  \n             X has remained inaccessible in various parts of Pakistan for the sixth consecutive day, with disruptions reported in Rawalpindi, Karachi, Gujranwala, Lahore, and other cities, according to the monitoring website Downdetector. Directive Issued By The Court During Thursday’s hearing, SHC Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi instructed the PTA to ensure uninterrupted restoration of X’s services across the nation, as per Dawn. The directive came in response to a petition filed by senior journalists through Advocate Abdul Moiz Jaferii, contending that blocking access to X violated Article 19 and 19-A of the Constitution and was unlawful and arbitrary. \n             \n           According to Dawn, the petition named the PTA, Interior Ministry, and Information Ministry as respondents. Inaccessibility Of X (Formerly Twitter) X has been inaccessible since February 17, when former Rawalpindi commissioner Liaquat Chattha held a press conference and accused the chief election commissioner and chief justice of being involved in rigging the Feb 8 general elections. Various rights bodies, journalists’ organizations, and internet service providers have criticized the restrictions on social media, highlighting the losses incurred due to disruptions. US Urges To Lift Social Media Restriction The United States also urged Pakistan to lift social media restrictions, expressing concern over any limitations on freedom of association and expression. Highlights Of The Hearing During yesterday’s hearing, Advocate Jafferi noted that the interior ministry denied issuing directives for X’s suspension, while the IT ministry highlighted the flourishing state of the information technology sector in Pakistan. Justice Abbasi questioned the authority behind the suspension orders, to which Jafferi emphasized that only the PTA holds the authority to suspend or slow down X’s services. The lawyer further highlighted that journalists and others who used X for financial purposes were suffering due to the disruptions, adding that the suspension also hindered the provision of advertisements to Palestine and information regarding the situation in Gaza. “For how many days has X been suspended for?” the judge asked. He also recalled that the court had earlier issued directives for uninterrupted access to the internet and social media platforms. Why were Services of X Disrupted?  However, Jafferi highlighted that his petition was different, adding that disruptions to the services of X began the day the former Rawalpindi commissioner’s statement pertaining to alleged rigging emerged. The SHC directed the PTA to fully restore X and requested detailed responses from the respondents in the upcoming hearing. Fundamental Rights Violated By PTA The petition underscored that the PTA’s actions invaded fundamental rights and violated laws governing telecommunications regulation in the country. It called for immediate restoration of public access to X and urged permanent restraint on arbitrary restrictions, in line with applicable laws and the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973. The SHC’s directive marks a crucial step towards upholding freedom of speech and expression in Pakistan’s digital landscape.",

I’m not going to go into the specifics of that because it is still under negotiation in terms of hammering out the details of it,” CNN reported Sullivan as saying. Continuous Negotiations  Moreover, Hamas was briefed on the Paris talks on Sunday evening. However, any possible final deal is still, at the earliest, days away as negotiators continue to find out the actual details. \n             \n           “There will have to be indirect discussions by Qatar and Egypt with Hamas because ultimately they will have to agree to release the hostages. That work is underway. And we hope that in the coming days, we can drive to a point where there is actually a firm and final agreement on this issue. But we will have to wait and see,” he added. When he was asked about how hopeful he was about a potential deal, Sullivan declined to give details and said that he would not put percentage chances on it. “There’s been a lot of to’ing and fro’ing. So I’m not going to make predictions and I’m not going to kind of put percentage chances on it,” he said. Liberation Of The Hostages Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stressed on Sunday that Israel wants to liberate the remaining hostages in Gaza, adding, “We are all working on it. We want it. I want it.” He said Hamas’ “crazy” demands were holding up the deal, CNN reported. Moreover, the negotiators will continue their discussions in Doha on Monday, according to a diplomat and sources. Those talks will be between working-level officials to focus on ironing out technical issues, they added. Adding to the details, the discussions will include officials from the parties involved in the Paris talks, including, Qatar, Egypt, the US and Israel. From the US side, these will include officials from the CIA. \nNotably, the Israeli PM has repeatedly emphasised that the war in Gaza will continue until Israel destroys Hamas’ leadership and rescues the hostages.",

        "text": "Representative Image   \n         Tel Aviv:  To bypass Hamas, Israeli humanitarian aid to Gaza will be delivered through a reopened crossing on the northeastern side of the Strip, Israel’s War Cabinet decided.  \n             Till now, humanitarian aid has passed through either the Kerem Shalom crossing or Egypt’s Rafah crossing. Both are on the southern end of Gaza, next to Rafah, where Hamas reportedly has four battalions. Hamas has been hijacking trucks carrying food, water, medicine, fuel and other aid. Delivery Of Humanitarian Aid Via Karni In the coming days, deliveries to areas of Gaza under Israeli control will be routed through the site of the old Karni crossing, near Kibbutz Nahal Oz. Karni was a cargo terminal that opened in 1994 after the signing of the Oslo Accords. \n             \n           It was closed in 2011 for security reasons as deliveries were increasingly routed through the larger and more modern Kerem Shalom crossing. Demolition Of Karni Structure Israel demolished Karni’s remaining structures in 2022. \nHumanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza are unpopular among Israelis. For weeks, protesters chanting “Don’t feed Hamas” have tried to disrupt the aid trucks at the Kerem Shalom crossing and other points where the deliveries are inspected. Netanyahu has defended the aid transfers, saying a degree of aid is necessary to continue the war to free hostages and remove Hamas from control of Gaza.

        "description": "President Biden made this move as a legislative logjam in the GOP-led House showed no signs of abating.",
        "text": "President Joe Biden talks with Seth Meyers during a taping of the \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\" Monday, Feb. 26, 2024, in New York. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)   \n         Joe Biden ‘Pleads’ Congress:  US President Joe Biden on Tuesday pleaded with the top four leaders of Congress to avoid a looming government shutdown early next month, to act quickly, and pass emergency aid for Ukraine and Israel. President Biden made this move as a legislative logjam in the GOP-led House showed no signs of abating.  \n             Among those hosted by Joe Biden were House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., in the Oval Office. Also present was Vice President Kamala Harris. “The need is urgent. The consequences of inaction every day in Ukraine are dire,” said Biden of the Ukraine aid as he noted that Israel also needs US funding to replenish its supply of Iron Dome interceptors that it uses to protect against the rockets fired by Hamas and Hezbollah. As of now, Republicans in the House have refused to bring up the $95 billion national security package that bolsters aid for Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific. That measure cleared the Senate on a bipartisan 70-29 vote this month, but Johnson has resisted scheduling it for a vote in the House. \n             \n           Bill Burns, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) also joined Tuesday’s meeting. Burns has played key roles in coordinating the US response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as well as efforts to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas after its October 7 attack on Israel. Apart from the national security package, government funding for agriculture, transportation, military construction, and some veterans’ services expires Friday, and funding for the rest of the government, including the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, and the State Department expires a week later on March 8, the day after Biden is set to deliver his State of the Union address. “It’s Congress’ responsibility to fund the government. A government shutdown would damage the economy significantly. We need a bipartisan solution,” said the POTUS. The Senate’s top two leaders also urged that the government be kept open. Parts of the government could start to scale back operations as early as Friday unless a deal is reached on spending and legislation is sent to Biden for his signature. Schumer said in a speech ahead of the White House meeting that he hoped it would be an “important, timely and fruitful discussion” and urged Johnson to tune out demands from hardline conservatives. “We recognize that the speaker of the House is in a difficult position, but he must reject the MAGA hard right which wants a shutdown, wants to hurt America, and does not represent a majority of Republicans in the House, a majority of Republicans in the Senate and a majority of Republicans in America, let alone all Americans,” Schumer said adding that he would make a strong case to Johnson for why the military aid for Ukraine is immediately needed. “Ukraine is low on ammo, on anti-air defense systems, on munitions, on long-range artillery. This shortage is creating asymmetry on the battlefield. Russia can fire and take out Ukrainian targets, but Ukraine increasingly can’t fire back,” Schumer said. (With AP inputs)",

        "description": "Israel-Hamas War: US is considering airdropping medical assistance and other aid into Gaza as land deliveries become increasingly difficult.",
        "text": "Indian UN Staff Member Killed In Gaza, Making It 1st International Casualty In Israel-Hamas Conflict   \n         Washington DC:  Amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas which is escalating each day, the White House is considering airdropping aid from its military planes into Gaza as land deliveries are very difficult in the region, Reuters reported citing an American official. The Axios news site, which first reported the news, stated that such action would not be effective, and that large amounts of aid can only be moved in by land. “The situation is really bad. We are unable to get enough aid [in] by truck so we need desperate measures like airdrops,” Reuters quoted a US official as saying.  \n             Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has flattened almost all densely populated enclaves and displaced all its population. Gazans are on the brink of starvation and not even getting drinking water. Notably, the volume of humanitarian aid getting into Gaza decreased by half in this month in comparison to last month, U.N. data shows. \nIsrael-Hamas War: Food Shortage In Gaza As many as 5,76,000 people living in Gaza strip, which is one quarter of the population, are near to extreme food shortage, as per U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The UN office stated on Tuesday that humanitarian aid groups faced “overwhelming obstacles just to get a bare minimum of supplies into Gaza.” \nEvery one in six children under 2 years age are suffering acute malnutrition in northern Gaza. People in the Palestine enclave are forced to rely on “woefully inadequate” food aid to survive. \nIsrael-Hamas War: UN Official Accused Israel During an interview to the Guardian newspaper, a U.N. expert on the right to food, Michael Fakhri said that Israel is intentionally depriving the people living in Gaza of food, saying this “is clearly a war crime.” \n             \n           Israel’s Deputy United States Ambassador Jonathan Miller said that his country is committed to improving the humanitarian situation in Gaza Strip and pace of humanitarian aid depended on the capacity of the all the agencies including the UN. Axios, the first to report on the U.S. considering airdrops, quoted American officials stating that such actions would have a limited impact, as a military plane can only drop an amount of supplies equivalent to that transported by one or two trucks.",

        "description": "The attack on the Gibraltar Eagle, later claimed by the Houthis, further escalates tensions gripping the Red Sea after American-led strikes on the rebels.",
        "text": "FILE PHOTO: A cargo ship boat model is seen in front of \"Red Sea\" and \"Houthi attacks\" words in this illustration taken January 9, 2024. (REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo)   \n         Jerusalem:  Houthi rebels fired a missile, striking a U.S.-owned ship Monday just off the coast of Yemen in the Gulf of Aden, less than a day after they launched an anti-ship cruise missile toward an American destroyer in the Red Sea.  \n             The attack on the Gibraltar Eagle, later claimed by the Houthis, further escalates tensions gripping the Red Sea after American-led strikes on the rebels. The Houthis’ attacks have roiled global shipping, amid Israel’s war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, targeting a crucial corridor linking Asian and Mideast energy and cargo shipments to the Suez Canal onward to Europe. The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which oversees Mideast waters, said Monday’s attack happened some 110 miles (177 kilometers) miles southeast of Aden. It said the ship’s captain reported that the “port side of vessel hit from above by a missile.” Private security firms Ambrey and Dryad Global told The Associated Press that the vessel was the Eagle Gibraltar, a Marshall Islands-flagged bulk carrier. The U.S. military’s Central Command later acknowledged the strike. \n             \n           “The ship has reported no injuries or significant damage and is continuing its journey,” Central Command said. Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree claimed the attack in a recorded television address that aired Monday night. “The Yemeni armed forces consider all American and British ships and warships participating in the aggression against our country as hostile targets,” he said. The vessel is owned by Eagle Bulk Shipping, a Stamford, Connecticut-based firm traded on the New York Stock Exchange. In a statement to the AP, the company acknowledged the strike and said it caused “limited damage to a cargo hold but (the ship) is stable and is heading out of the area.” “All seafarers onboard the vessel are confirmed to be uninjured,” the firm said. “The vessel is carrying a cargo of steel products. Eagle Bulk management is in close contact with all relevant authorities concerning this matter.” Satellite-tracking data analyzed by the AP showed the Eagle Gibraltar had been bound for the Suez Canal, but rapidly turned around at the time of the attack. Central Command said it detected a separate anti-ship ballistic missile launch toward the southern Red Sea on Monday, though it ”failed in flight and impacted on land in Yemen.” The U.S. Maritime Administration, under the Transportation Department, also issued a warning Monday saying there continues to be “a high degree of risk to commercial vessels” traveling near Yemen. “While the decision to transit remains at the discretion of individual vessels and companies, it is recommended that U.S. flag and U.S.-owned commercial vessels” stay away from Yemen in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden “until further notice,” the advisory said. Sunday’s missile launch toward the American warship also marked the first U.S.-acknowledged fire by the Houthis since America and allied nations began strikes Friday on the rebels following weeks of assaults on shipping in the Red Sea. The Houthi fire in the direction of the USS Laboon, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer operating in the southern reaches of the Red Sea, Central Command said. The missile came from near Hodeida, a Red Sea port city long held by the Houthis, the U.S. said. “An anti-ship cruise missile was fired from Iranian-backed Houthi militant areas of Yemen toward USS Laboon,” Central Command said. “There were no injuries or damage reported.” The Houthis did not acknowledge that attack. It wasn’t presently clear whether the U.S. would retaliate for the latest attacks, though President Joe Biden has said he “will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary.” The first day of U.S.-led strikes Friday hit 28 locations and struck more than 60 targets with cruise missiles and bombs launched by fighter jets, warships and a submarine. Sites hit included weapon depots, radars and command centers, including in remote mountain areas, the U.S. has said. The Houthis have yet to acknowledge how severe the damage was from the strikes, which they said killed five of their troops and wounded six others. U.S. forces followed up with a strike Saturday on a Houthi radar site. Since November, the rebels have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea, saying they were avenging Israel’s offensive in Gaza against Hamas. But they have frequently targeted vessels with tenuous or no clear links to Israel, imperiling shipping in a key route for global trade. Even the leader of the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group, Hassan Nasrallah, obliquely referenced the widening Houthi attacks on ships in a speech Sunday, saying that “the sea has become a battlefield of missiles, drones and warships” and blaming the U.S. strikes for escalating maritime tensions. “The most dangerous thing is what the Americans did in the Red Sea, (it) will harm the security of all maritime navigation,” Nasrallah said. Though the Biden administration and its allies have tried to calm tensions in the Middle East for weeks and prevent any wider conflict, the strikes in the Red Sea threaten to ignite one. It’s also affecting shipping for the Middle East nation of Qatar, one of the world’s top natural gas suppliers. Three liquid natural gas tankers that had recently loaded in Qatar and were bound for the Suez Canal remain idling off Oman, while another coming from Europe to Qatar remains off Saudi Arabia. QatarEnergy and government officials did not respond to a request for comment. Saudi Arabia, which supports the Yemeni government-in-exile that the Houthis are fighting, sought to distance itself from the attacks on Houthi sites as it tries to maintain a delicate détente with Iran and a cease-fire it has in Yemen. The Saudi-led, U.S.-backed war in Yemen that began in 2015 has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more. The American military did not specifically say the fire targeted the Laboon, following a pattern by the U.S. since the Houthi attacks began. However, U.S. sailors have received combat ribbons for their actions in the Red Sea — something handed out only to those who face active hostilities with an enemy force.",

        "text": "Dr S Jaishankar    \n         Tehran:  External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Monday conveyed India’s concerns about the increasing pirate and militia attacks on the cargo ships in the Indian Ocean, while addressing a joint statement with his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amirabdollahian in Tehran. He said that such threats have a direct bearing on India’s energy and economic interest as he underlined that this “fraught situation” is not to the benefit of any party. “There have also been recently a perceptible increase in threats to the safety of maritime commercial traffic in this important part of the Indian Ocean,” he said in a joint press statement after wide-ranging talks with Iranian counterpart Hossein Amirabdollahian.  \n             He stressed that it’s important that this issue be “speedily addressed”, in an apparent reference to targeting of merchant vessels in the Red Sea – one of the busiest trade routes – by Iranian-backed Yemen’s Houthi rebels amid the Israel-Hamas conflict. “We have even seen some attacks in the vicinity of India. This is a matter of great concern to the international community. Obviously, it also has a direct bearing on India’s energy and economic interests. This fraught situation is not to the benefit of any party and this must be clearly recognised,” he said. His remarks came on a day when a missile fired by Houthis struck a US-owned ship just off the coast of Yemen in the Gulf of Aden. A day earlier, Houthi fired an anti-ship cruise missile toward an American destroyer in the Red Sea, according to reports. The US and the UK last week launched air strikes targeting the Houthi positions in Yemen. \n             \n           India has been closely monitoring the unfolding situation in the Red Sea. The Indian Navy has already enhanced deployment of its frontline ships and surveillance aircraft for maritime security operations in view of the maritime environment in the critical sea lanes including the North and Central Arabian Sea. Jaishankar, who is here as part of the ongoing high-level exchanges between the two sides, also said that both India and Iran are concerned about recent events in West Asia and emphasise the importance of preventing further escalation of violence and hostilities in the region. He said the “deeply concerning” situation in Gaza was naturally a subject of discussion. “The loss of civilian lives, especially that of women and children was our primary focus. There is a visible humanitarian crisis that needs to be addressed and the creation of sustainable humanitarian corridors is the need of the day,” he said and welcomed the international community’s efforts in that direction. “India itself has delivered shipments of relief material to Gaza and contributed to the UNRWA,” he added.",

More than 100 days into the conflict, Palestinian authorities say the death toll in the coastal territory has passed 24,000.

Here’s the latest: QATAR’S PRIME MINISTER SPEAKS OF GAZA’S DESTRUCTION: ”GAZA IS NOT THERE ANY MORE.’ JERUSALEM  — Qatar’s prime minister offered stinging criticism of Israel and the international community on Tuesday over the ongoing Israeli war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who also serves as Qatar’s foreign minister, said a two-state solution was required to end the conflict and warned that Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack and the Israeli response showed the region could not go back to the way it was before. “Gaza is not there anymore. I mean, there is nothing over there,” he said, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “It’s carpet bombing everywhere.” He also brought up the ongoing tensions in the West Bank, which has seen Palestinians killed as well by Israeli security forces, and urged for an end to Palestinian divisions. “We cannot have a two-state solution without having a government and politicians in Israel who believe in coexisting together side by side peacefully and we cannot have all this ongoing without ending this war,” he said. He warned that a military confrontation in the Mideast waterways “will not contain” the attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels who on Monday fired a missile, striking a U.S.-owned ship just off the coast of Yemen in the Gulf of Aden. “What we have right now in the region is a recipe of escalation everywhere,” Sheikh Mohammed added. ISRAEL SAYS ROCKETS FIRED FROM GAZA, REPORTEDLY ONE OF THE STRONGEST BOMBARDMENTS IN MORE THAN A WEEK TEL AVIV  — Israel says a barrage of at least 25 rockets was launched on Tuesday from the Gaza Strip toward southern Israel, damaging a store. It was one of the strongest bombardments from Gaza in more than a week. It came a day after Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the Israeli army was expanding military control from northern Gaza toward other parts of the strip. Hamas has continued to fire rockets at Israel throughout the war, even as Israel says it is dismantling Hamas’s military capabilities in ever-expanding areas of Gaza. Israeli Channel 12 TV said the rockets on Tuesday were launched from the central Gaza town of Bureij. In the area of Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, Israeli troops located approximately 100 rocket set-installations and 60 ready-to-use rockets, the military said, claiming its forces killed dozens of militants during the activity. At a news conference on Monday, Gallant said he expects military operations in southern Gaza to “end soon” but gave no timeframe. He spoke a day after the White House called on Israel to curtail its offensive. Gallant said Israel is still targeting Hamas’ leaders, calling them the “head of the snake” and said they are believed to be hiding in Khan Younis, the southern city where the offensive has been focused in recent weeks. He stressed that military pressure is the only way to win the release of the more than 100 hostages still in Hamas captivity. “Only from a position of strength can we ensure the release of hostages,” he said. ISRAELI MILITARY LOOKING INTO WEST BANK CLASHES ON MONDAY THAT KILLED A PALESTINIAN WOMAN TEL AVIV, Israel  — The Israeli military said on Tuesday that it’s reviewing an incident in the occupied West Bank the previous day when a Palestinian woman was killed in clashes with Israeli forces. The Palestinian Health Ministry said the woman — 23-year-old Ahed Mohammed — was killed along with a man, and nine Palestinians were wounded. The Israeli military said the clashes occurred in the town of Dura, where about 100 people threw firebombs and blocks at troops, who fired back. The military said one person was killed, others were hit and that the incident was “under review.” It did not confirm reports of the woman’s death. The West Bank has experienced a surge in violence since the war in Gaza erupted and the Palestinian Health Ministry says Israeli forces have killed some 350 Palestinians there since Oct. 7. Most have been killed in confrontations with Israeli forces during arrest raids or violent protests. Palestinians from the West Bank have also carried out attacks against Israelis during that time. EXCHANGE OF FIRE ALONG ISRAEL-EGYPT BORDER KILLS 1 IN EGYPT, INJURES AN ISRAELI SOLDIER JERUSALEM  — Israel said one of its troops was “slightly injured” in an exchange of fire along the country’s border with Egypt, which Cairo attributed to drug smuggling. One person in Egypt was killed. The statement from the Israeli military late on Monday said the fighting happened near the Nitzana border crossing with Egypt on the Sinai Peninsula, and that there were 20 armed suspects. The Israelis and the suspects exchanged fire, with Israel saying “hits were identified” among the suspects, without elaborating. The Israeli soldier who was hit “was evacuated to a hospital to receive medical treatment and her family has been informed,” the military said. The Israeli military did not identify the suspects. An Egyptian military statement on Tuesday described the suspects involved as trying to smuggle drugs. It said one person was killed and six people were arrested afterwards. Egypt and Israel have had a peace deal since 1979, but Israel’s monthslong war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip has strained ties. UN CHIEF WARNS OF STARVATION AND DISEASE IN GAZA AS AID STAGGERS UNITED NATIONS  — The U.N. secretary-general says Gaza faces “the long shadow of starvation” and the risk of disease outbreaks because of barriers to delivering vital aid. Antonio Guterres did not mention Israel by name in his remarks Monday, but blamed the inability to meet Gaza’s growing humanitarian needs on widespread bombardment, barriers to entering the territory and restrictions on distribution inside of it — all under Israel’s control. He said he was “deeply troubled by the clear violation of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing.” Israeli officials have denied hindering aid delivery, saying the U.N. needs to provide more workers and trucks. But Guterres said the U.N. and its partners “cannot effectively deliver humanitarian aid while Gaza is under such heavy, widespread and unrelenting bombardment.” He pointed to the deaths of 152 U.N. staffers in Gaza since the start of the war, “the largest single loss of life in the history of our organization.”",

        "text": "US Military Launches Another Barrage Of Missiles Against Houthi Sites In Yemen (representative Image).   \n         The U.S. military fired another wave of ship- and submarine-launch missile strikes against Houthi-controlled sites Wednesday, U.S. officials said, marking the fourth time in days it has directly targeted the group in Yemen as violence that ignited in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war continues to spill over in the Middle East. The strikes followed the official announcement that the U.S. has put the Houthis back on its list of specially designated global terrorists. The sanctions that come with the formal designation are meant to sever violent extremist groups from their sources of financing. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that have not been made public yet.  \n             Despite the sanctions and military strikes, including a large-scale operation Friday carried out by U.S. and British warships and warplanes that hit more than 60 targets across Yemen, the Houthis are continuing their harassment campaign of commercial and military ships. The latest incident occurred Wednesday when a one-way attack drone was launched from a Houthi-controlled area in Yemen and struck the Marshall Islands-flagged, U.S.-owned and -operated M/V Genco Picardy in the Gulf of Aden. The U.S. has also strongly warned Iran to cease providing weapons to the Houthis. On Thursday a U.S. raid on a dhow intercepted ballistic missile parts the U.S. said Iran was shipping to Yemen. Two U.S. Navy SEALs remain unaccounted for after one was knocked off the vessel by a wave during the seizure and the second followed the overcome SEAL into the water. On Wednesday, Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said the U.S. would continue to take military action to prevent further attacks. \n             \n           “They are exploiting this situation to conduct attacks against the ships and vessels from more than 50 countries … around the world. And so we’re going to continue to work with our partners in the region to prevent those attacks or deter those attacks in the future,” Ryder said. There have been several incidents since the Friday joint operations. The Houthis fired an anti-ship cruise missile toward a U.S. Navy destroyer over the weekend, but the ship shot it down. The Houthis then struck a U.S.-owned ship in the Gulf of Aden on Monday and a Malta-flagged bulk carrier in the Red Sea on Tuesday. In response Tuesday, the U.S. struck four anti-ship ballistic missiles that were prepared to launch and presented an imminent threat to merchant and U.S. Navy ships in the region. Hours later, the Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack on the Malta-flagged bulk carrier Zografia. The ship was hit, but no one was injured and it continued on its way.",

        "description": "The US has reacted on the escalating tensions between Iran and Pakistan and has urged restraint on all sides.",
        "text": "Iran-Pakistan Row: US Expresses Concern About Escalating Tensions, Urges Restraint   \n         Washington, DC:  The United States on Thursday (local time) expressed its concerns over the escalating tensions between Iran and Pakistan following Iran’s missile strikes in Balochistan on Wednesday. US State Department of State Matthew Miller clarified Washington’s stance, stating that his country has urged restraint on all sides. He emphasised that there is no need for escalation in the matter. While addressing a press briefing, Miller asserted that the US has taken note of the Pakistani government’s recent remarks about the importance of ‘cooperative relations between Pakistan and its neighbors.  \n             Responding to question on how the US administration see the situation between both the countries, Miller stated that the Washington is concerned about the escalating tensions in the region. “We are concerned about escalating tensions in the region. It’s been something we have spoken number of times, we’ve focused on. We’ve been incredibly concerned about the potential for escalation since October 7,” Miller said. “That’s why we have engaged in intense diplomatic efforts to try to prevent escalation. We noted the comments from the government of Pakistan, about the importance of cooperative relations between Pakistan and its neighbours. We thought those were productive useful statements, and certainly, there’s no need for escalation and we would urge restraint on all sides in this case,” he added. When asked about media reports claiming that the Pakistan government consulted Washington before retaliatory strike on Iran, Miller said, “I do not have anything private conversations to read out.” \n             \n           “We don’t believe this should escalate in any way, shape or form. Pakistan is a major non-NATO ally of the United States, that will remain the case, but we would urge restraint in this case.” Matthew Miller called Iran a major funder of Hezbollah and a principal supporter of Hamas for years. In another query about the ongoing tensions between Iran and Pakistan after strikes and counterstrikes, Miller said, “I think I made pretty clear yesterday what we think about Iran’s attacks, not just the strikes that were launched in the past three days against three of its neighbours but its long history of funding terrorism, funding instability and sowing discord in the Middle East. That’s something we have seen contribute to conflict in Gaza.” Iran’s Strikes In Pakistan Iran’s strikes in Pakistan came after Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) launched missiles into Iraq’s Kurdistan region at what it called an Israeli “spy headquarters” and at alleged ISIS-linked targets in Syria, Al Arabiya News reported. “You have seen Iran as the principal supporter of Hamas for years. They are the major funder of Hezbollah. They are one of the major funders of the Houthis. We have seen the consequences of the actions that Iran has taken to add to regional instability and that’s why we continue to take actions to hold Iran accountable and also send clear very messages to Iran that we don’t believe this should escalate in any way, shape or form. Pakistan is a major non-NATO ally of the United States, and that will remain the case, but we would urge restraint in this case. We do not want to see escalation and don’t think there’s a need for escalation,” he added. US Is Monitoring The Situation Meanwhile, National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications at the White House, John Kirby said that the US is monitoring the situation regarding Iran and Pakistan “very very closely” and they do not want to see escalation. While speaking in a press Gaggle en route Morrisville, John Kirby said, “You’ve all seen the reports out of Pakistan that they fired some missiles into Iran. We’re monitoring this very, very closely. We don’t want to see an escalation, clearly, in South Asia – South and Central Asia. And we’re in touch with our Pakistani counterparts, as you might expect.” “We’ll let the Pakistanis speak to their military operations. I’m not going to parse that or do any or try to, you know, operationalize it here from Air Force One,” he added. Pakistan’s Missile Strike In Iran  Pakistan said on Thursday that it has launched missile strikes into Iran and that “a number of terrorists were killed during the intelligence-based operation,” codenamed “Marg Bar Sarmachar”. In a statement, Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) said that it had undertaken a series of “highly coordinated and specifically targeted precision military strikes against terrorist hideouts” in the Siestan-o-Baluchistan province of Iran. “A number of terrorists were killed during the intelligence-based operation codenamed “Marg Bar Sarmachar,” it said. Pakistan’s military action comes after it condemned Tuesday’s strike by Iran, which it said killed two children. Standoff Weapons Standoff weapons were missiles fired from aircraft at a distance. It means that Pak’s fighter jets didn’t cross Iranian border or enter its airspace. According to EurAsian Times reports, Chinese-built fighter jets JF-17 ‘Thunder’ and J-10C ‘Vigorous Dragon’ were used by Iran on the other hand Pakistan also deployed Chinese Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Wing Loong II in its operation. Pak’s fighter jets engaged the targets inside Iran with precision-guided air-to-ground munitions, the report added. Islamabad state that as many as seven locations were targeted after aerial survey conducted by UAVs. The reconnaissance confirmed the “presence of high-value terrorist targets”. The primary instrument utilised in the airstrikes was the GIDS B-REK. This rocket-boosted glide bomb boasts a long reach of 170 kilometers. Impressively accurate, this piece of weaponry truly stands as a precision-guided ordinance.",

        "text": "Joe Biden had asked Netanyahu to send a senior team composed of military, intelligence, and humanitarian officials to Washington to discuss an alternative approach.    \n         Washington DC:  Amid the ongoing conflict between the Israel Defence Forces and Hamas militants, United States President Joe Biden had a telephonic conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday (local time). Both the leaders spoke to each other after nearly a month. During the conversation, President Biden reiterated his vision of a ‘two-state solution’ while guaranteeing Israel’s security. He also discussed the efforts to secure the release of all remaining hostages and reviewed the situation in Gaza.  \n             “The President and Prime Minister discussed ongoing efforts to secure the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas. The President and the Prime Minister reviewed the situation in Gaza and the shift to targeted operations that will enable the flow of increasing amounts of humanitarian assistance while keeping the military pressure on Hamas and its leaders,” the White House said in a statement. The United States President also hailed the Israeli government’s decision to allow the shipment of flour directly through Ashdod port for the Palestinian people. Notably, America is working on options for more direct maritime delivery of assistance into war-affected Gaza. \nBoth the leaders also discussed the recent progress in ensuring the Palestinian Authority’s revenues are available to pay salaries, including for the Palestinian Security Forces in the West Bank. President Biden also pressed on Israel’s responsibility to reduce civilian harm, even as it battles with Hamas. \n“The President discussed Israel’s responsibility even as it maintains military pressure on Hamas and its leaders to reduce civilian harm and protect the innocent. The President also discussed his vision for a more durable peace and security for Israel fully integrated within the region and a two-state solution with Israel’s security guaranteed,” the statement added. \n             \n           Notably, the call came amid growing frustration in the White House with the Israeli leader over the course of the war against Hamas, according to The Hill. Recently, Netanyahu rejected the idea of the creation of a Palestinian state that the US has put as a priority goal in supporting Israel’s war against Hamas over the October 7 terrorist attack. Although President Biden has stood against calls for Israel to agree to a cease-fire, but is facing increasing pressure from Democrats in Congress — including from strong supporters of Israel — over US military assistance to Israel seen as contributing to Palestinian deaths, The Hill reported.",

        "text": "Representative Image   \n         Islamabad:  Pakistani Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani and his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian have agreed to de-escalate the situation that arose after strikes were carried out by both countries in each other’s territories. The Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed this development. In a statement released on Friday, the Foreign Ministry stated that Jilani had a telephonic conversation with Amir-Abdollahian, during which he expressed Pakistan’s desire to work with Iran based on the principles of mutual trust and cooperation. He also emphasized the strong and brotherly relations between Pakistan and Iran.  \n             “The two foreign ministers agreed that working level cooperation and close coordination on counter terrorism and other aspects of mutual concern should be strengthened. They also agreed to de-escalate the situation,” the statement read. “The return of ambassadors of the two countries to their respective capitals was also discussed,” it added. On Tuesday night, Iran carried out a missile and drone attack against the armed group Jaish al-Adl in Pakistan’s southwestern border province of Balochistan. Pakistan in turn struck armed-group targets inside Iran on Thursday. Pakistan has accused Iran of violating its airspace and causing the death of two Pakistani children. The incident occurred when Iran targeted certain areas near the Pakistan-Iran border within Pakistan’s territory. In response, Pakistan has taken diplomatic action by recalling its ambassador from Iran and advising Iran not to send its ambassador to Islamabad. \n             \n           Furthermore, Pakistan’s military has announced that it conducted successful strikes against hideouts located inside Iran. These hideouts were being used by terrorists who were responsible for recent attacks in Pakistan. Pakistan said that the military strikes carried out by them against the terrorist hideouts in Iran demonstrate the country’s commitment to combating terrorism and ensuring the safety and security of its citizens. The Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned Pakistan’s drone attack on non-Iranian villagers on the border of the two nations, calling it “unbalanced and unacceptable.”It said Iran adheres to the policy of “good neighbourliness and brotherhood” between two nations and does not allow enemies to strain the ties between Tehran and Islamabad. The tit-for-tat attacks have been the largest cross-border intrusions in recent years and have raised alarm about the potential for wider instability since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted on October 7. On Thursday, Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was committed to good neighbourly relations with Pakistan but called on Islamabad to prevent the establishment of “terrorist bases” on its soil. Pakistan issued a similar statement with its Ministry of Foreign Affairs saying that its “sole” reason for the retaliatory attacks was “in pursuit of Pakistan’s own security and national interest, which is paramount and cannot be compromised”.",

        "title": "Palestinian Death Toll In Gaza Surpasses 25,000 While Israel Announces The Death Of Another Hostage",
        "description": "The deaths, destruction and displacement from the war are without precedent in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.",
        "text": "Demonstrators hold signs and wave flags during a pro-Palestinian rally in Brussels, Sunday, Jan 21, 2024. (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert)   \n         RAFAH, Gaza Strip:  The Palestinian death toll from the war between Israel and Hamas has soared past 25,000, the Health Ministry in the Gaza Strip said Sunday, while Israel announced the death of another hostage and appeared far from achieving its goals of freeing more than 100 others and crushing the militant group.  \n             The deaths, destruction and displacement from the war are without precedent in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The war has divided Israelis while the offensive threatens to ignite a wider conflict involving Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen that support the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he stressed in his conversation with U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday that he rejects Hamas demands for a cease-fire, Israeli forces’ withdrawal and the release of Palestinians held by Israel in exchange for the remaining hostages. He said that agreeing means another devastating Hamas attack “would only be a matter of time.” Netanyahu also rejects calls from U.S, its closest ally, for postwar plans that would include a path to Palestinian statehood. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the refusal to accept a two-state solution unacceptable. \n             \n           “The Middle East is a tinderbox. We must do all we can to prevent conflict igniting across the region,” Guterres added. “And that starts with an immediate humanitarian cease-fire to relieve the suffering in Gaza.” In the latest of near-daily clashes between Hezbollah forces and Israeli troops along the Lebanese border, an Israeli airstrike Sunday hit a car near a Lebanese army checkpoint in the southern town of Kafra, killing one person and injuring several others, Lebanese state media reported. Israel’s military said its aircraft and tanks struck a number of Hezbollah targets, and that an anti-tank missile launched from Lebanon hit a house in Avivim in northern Israel. No injuries were reported. GAZA DEATH TOLL CLIMBS The war began with Hamas’ attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7. Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 250 hostages back to Gaza. Israel’s military announced the death of 19-year-old Sgt. Shay Levinson, who was among the hostages. His date of death was given as Oct. 7, but there were no further details. According to Israeli media, his body is still in Gaza. Israel has responded to the Oct. 7 attack with a bombing campaign and ground invasion that laid waste to entire neighborhoods in northern Gaza and spread south, striking some areas where it told civilians to seek refuge. Ground operations are now focused on the southern city of Khan Younis and built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. “The plumes of smoke from tanks, artillery and the planes of the air force will continue to cover the sky over the Gaza Strip until we will achieve our goals,” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said. Israel’s military said the demolition last week of a key building at Israa University in Gaza was under review, and asserted that preliminary findings indicated Hamas had used the compound for military purposes. The university has said the “attack” came weeks after Israeli forces occupied the building. Since the war started, 25,105 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, while another 62,681 have been wounded, the Health Ministry said. The toll included the 178 bodies brought to Gaza’s hospitals since Saturday, Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra said. The overall toll is thought to be higher because many casualties remain buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot reach, Al-Qidra said. The Health Ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its figures but says about two-thirds of the people killed in Gaza were women and minors. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, but its casualty figures from previous wars were largely consistent with those of U.N. agencies and even the Israeli military. The Israeli military says it has killed around 9,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and other militant infrastructure in dense neighborhoods. The military released footage of a tunnel under a residential neighborhood in Khan Younis where the army believes at least 20 hostages were kept at different times. The war has displaced some 85% of Gaza’s residents, with hundreds of thousands packing U.N.-run shelters and camps in the south. U.N. officials say a quarter of the population of 2.3 million is starving as a trickle of humanitarian aid reaches them because of the fighting and Israeli restrictions. Israel said 260 trucks of aid entered Gaza on Sunday, the highest number since the war began. About 500 entered daily before that, according to the U.N. “Bread does not suffice for one hour,” said Ahmad Al-Nashawi, who accepted donated food at a tent camp in the southern city of Rafah. “You can see how many children we have other than women and men. What matters most for a child is to eat.” ISRAELIS INCREASINGLY DIVIDED Some top Israeli officials have begun to acknowledge that Netanyahu’s goals of “complete victory” over Hamas and returning the remaining hostages might be mutually exclusive. A member of Israel’s War Cabinet, former army chief Gadi Eisenkot, said last week that the only way to free the hostages was through a cease-fire. But Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners push him to step up the offensive, with some calling for the “voluntary” emigration of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza and the re-establishment of Jewish settlements there. Hamas is believed to be using the hostages as shields for its top leaders. Israel has rescued one hostage, and Hamas says several have been killed in Israeli airstrikes or during failed rescue operations. Israel’s government faces growing pressure from hostages’ families, who want an exchange like the one during a weeklong November cease-fire. Other Israelis are frustrated by the security failures ahead of the Oct. 7 attack and by Netanyahu’s handling of the war. Near the site of an Oct. 7 massacre during a music festival, families of Israeli victims planted trees. “What happened after 109 days? Nothing. We’re just still waiting,” said one father, Idan Bahat.",

        "description": "The U.S. and Britain launched another wave of strikes Monday against Yemen's Houthi rebels, who have targeted international shipping in the Red Sea.",
        "text": "Palestinians who flee from Khan Younis from Israeli ground and air offensive on the Gaza Strip arrive in Rafah, southern Gaza, Monday, Jan. 22, 2024. (AP Photo/Fatima Shbair)   \n         Jerusalem:  Palestinian militants carried out the deadliest single attack on Israel’s forces since the Hamas raid that triggered the war, killing 21 soldiers, the military said Tuesday, a significant setback that could add to mounting calls for a cease-fire.  \n             Hours later, the military announced that ground forces had encircled the southern city of Khan Younis, Gaza’s second largest. That marked a major advance, but it was unclear how much closer it would bring Israel to defeating Hamas or freeing Israeli hostages — two central war aims that have proved increasingly elusive — or what impact it would have on cease-fire talks that appear to be gathering pace. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu mourned the soldiers but vowed to press ahead with the offensive until “absolute victory” over Hamas. But Israelis are increasingly divided on whether such a victory is possible — and whether it is compatible with bringing back the hostages. In previous conflicts, large numbers of casualties have pressured Israel to halt military operations. A senior Egyptian official said Israel has proposed a two-month cease-fire in which the hostages would be freed in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel and top Hamas leaders in Gaza would be allowed to relocate to other countries. \n             \n           The official, who was not authorized to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Hamas rejected the proposal and is insisting that no more hostages will be released until Israel ends its offensive and withdraws from Gaza. Israel’s government declined to comment on the talks. Egypt and Qatar — which have brokered past agreements between Israel and Hamas — were developing a multistage proposal to try to bridge the gaps, the official said. Families of the hostages have called for Israel to reach a deal with Hamas, saying time is running out to bring their relatives home alive. Israel launched its offensive after Hamas crossed the border Oct. 7, killing over 1,200 people and abducting some 250 others. More than 100 were released in November during a weeklong cease-fire. The offensive has caused widespread death and destruction, displaced an estimated 85% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people and left one-quarter facing starvation. Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen have meanwhile attacked U.S. and Israeli targets in support of the Palestinians. The U.S. and Britain launched another wave of strikes Monday against Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who have targeted international shipping in the Red Sea. Lebanon’s Hezbollah group said it fired rockets at a strategic military installation in northern Israel for a second time this month. ‘ONE OF THE HARDEST DAYS’ FOR ISRAEL Israeli reservists were preparing explosives on Monday to demolish two buildings in the built-up Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza when a militant fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a tank nearby. The blast triggered the explosives, causing both two-story buildings to collapse on the soldiers. At least 217 soldiers have been killed since the ground offensive began in late October, including three killed in a separate event Monday, according to the military. Netanyahu acknowledged on social media that it was “one of the hardest days” of the war but vowed to keep up the offensive. “We are in the middle of a war that is more than justified. In this war, we are making big achievements, like the encircling of Khan Younis, and there are also very heavy losses,” he later said in a video statement. Gaza’s Health Ministry said Tuesday that the bodies of 195 people killed in Israeli strikes were brought to hospitals in the previous 24 hours. Hospitals also received 354 wounded, it said. The fatalities brought the death toll in the strip to 25,490 since the war began, the ministry said. Another 63,354 were wounded, it added. The ministry’s count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. HEAVY FIGHTING IN KHAN YOUNIS Israel claims to have killed thousands of militants and to have largely defeated Hamas in northern Gaza in operations that caused widespread destruction to that part of the territory, including Gaza City. In recent weeks the offensive has focused on Khan Younis and refugee camps in central Gaza, including Maghazi, that date back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. The military said its forces had killed dozens of militants in Khan Younis in recent days and had encircled the city, without providing evidence. It was not possible to independently confirm those claims. Raed al-Nems, a spokesperson for the Palestine Red Crescent rescue service, said there was heavy fighting around the city’s Al-Amal Hospital. He said a shell had hit the fourth floor, killing one person and wounding 10 others. Medical teams were unable to enter or exit the hospital, and a territory-wide communication outage had further complicated rescue efforts, he said. Thousands of people fled Khan Younis on Tuesday, some on foot with only what they could carry. Thick, black smoke could be seen rising over the city. “We heard very intense shelling, and we couldn’t sleep all night because we were so afraid,” Ibtisam Abu Jommaiza said as she made her way out of the city. Israel believes Hamas commanders may be hiding in vast tunnel complexes beneath Khan Younis, the hometown of the group’s top leader in Gaza, Yehya Sinwar, whose location is unknown. Hamas leaders are also believed to be using hostages as human shields, further complicating any rescue efforts. PRESSURE FOR A CEASE-FIRE The growing death toll and dire humanitarian situation have led to increasing international pressure on Israel to scale back the offensive and agree to a path for the creation of a Palestinian state after the war. The United States, which has provided crucial military aid for the offensive, has joined those calls. But Netanyahu, whose popularity has plummeted since Oct. 7 and whose governing coalition is beholden to far-right parties, has rebuffed both demands. Instead, he has said Israel will need to expand operations and eventually take over the Gaza side of the border with Egypt — an area where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who have fled from other areas are packed into overflowing U.N.-run shelters and sprawling tent camps. That drew an angry protest from Egypt’s government, which rejected Israeli allegations that Hamas smuggles in weapons across the heavily guarded frontier. Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt’s State Information Service, said Monday that any Israeli move to occupy the border area would “lead to a serious threat” to relations between the two countries, which signed a landmark peace treaty over four decades ago. Egypt is also deeply concerned about any potential influx of Palestinian refugees into its Sinai Peninsula.",

        "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron share a light moment during the 75th Republic Day celebrations, at the Kartavya Path in New Delhi on Friday. (ANI Photo)   \n         New Delhi:  PM Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron held a productive discussion over tea on issues of ongoing conflict in Gaza and the developments on the Red Sea that have led to disruptions in commercial shipping lanes. The India-France defence roadmap was also discussed after the French president attended the Republic Day celebrations today. Notably, French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in India a few days ago and attended the Republic Day celebrations at Kartavya Path. Being the chief guest of the Republic Day celebrations, he was also given an elephant guard of honour.  \n             Discussions On Ongoing Conflict In Gaza Held Speaking about the meeting between PM Modi and French President Macron, he said, “As I mentioned to you in my opening remarks, when the two leaders met, they discussed not just areas of priority and focus in our bilateral partnership but also focused quite a lot on what’s happening in different parts of the world. Naturally, the ongoing conflict in Gaza and its various dimensions—the terror dimension, the humanitarian dimension, and the civil disruption dimension. All those things came up for discussion and both leaders shared their perspectives.” Vinay Kwatra stressed that disruptions caused to commercial shipping due to ongoing developments in the Red Sea are a matter of concern, which both leaders discussed in detail. He said India has always had strong partnerships with different stakeholders in the maritime domain. He said, “With regard to developments in the Red Sea, naturally, the disruptions, the potential disruption and the actual things happening in the maritime domain there that are causing disruption to commercial shipping are indeed a matter of serious concern and both leaders focused on it.” “With regard to a related point that was raised as to whether they agreed to work together on these points, I think we have always been. India has always been in very strong partnerships with different stakeholders in this maritime space, in a range of areas that are there: commercial shipping, right from the days of piracy and even going before that, before 2008, we’ve always had very strong partnerships with different players. \n             \n           It is important because those partnerships help you build an information matrix in which you can then respond to protect your commercial shipping interests and also other maritime security interests. So, yes, we have been, you know, working with other partners, coordinating with them in terms of information, etc., in terms of maritime security in particular,” he added. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday held a meeting in Jaipur. The two leaders held discussions on bilateral ties and exchanged perspectives on a wide range of bilateral and global issues in Jaipur. Focus On India-France Strategic Partnership “Taking India-France Strategic Partnership to greater heights! Productive discussions held between PM @narendramodi and President @EmmanuelMacron of France in Jaipur. The two leaders took stock of bilateral ties & exchanged perspectives on a wide-range of bilateral and global issues,” Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal wrote on X. The French leader is in India on a two-day state visit at the invitation of PM Modi. He was the chief guest at India’s 75th Republic Day. He arrived in Jaipur on Thursday, where he was welcomed by Rajasthan Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. During his visit, he visited Amber Fort and Jantar Mantar. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was pictured extending him a warm welcome at Jantar Mantar. The two leaders held a mega roadshow in Jaipur. Macron waved at the people who gathered there, acknowledging the warm welcome. PM Modi Explains UPI To President Macron PM Modi explained the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) digital payments system to French President Emmanuel Macron as the two leaders visited a local shop during their visit to Hawa Mahal in Jaipur. \nThe two leaders also connected over a cup of tea, and the French President made the payment through UPI.

        "description": "The World Court on Friday ordered Israel to ensure that its military does not commit any actions that could be genocide in its campaign in Gaza against Hamas, but it did not dictate a ceasefire.",
        "text": "'Not Only False, It Is Outrageous': Netanyahu Rejects Genocide Charges Against Israel   \n         Israel plans to continue to defend itself against Hamas, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after the International Court of Justice gave a nod to South Africa’s genocide claim against Israel on Friday. “The charge of genocide levelled against Israel is not only false, it’s outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it,” the Israeli PM said.  \n             “On the eve of the International Holocaust Remembrance Day, I again pledge as Prime Minister of Israel – Never Again. Israel will continue to defend itself against Hamas, a genocidal terror organization.” He said Israel’s commitment to international law is unwavering and equally unwavering is the country’s sacred commitment to continue to defend “our country and defend our people”. “Israel’s commitment to international law is unwavering. Equally unwavering is our sacred commitment to continue to defend our country and defend our people,” Netanyahu says in an English-language video posted online. Declaring Hamas a “genocidal” organization, Netanyahu argues that Israel’s war is against “terrorists, not against Palestinian civilians,” adding that Hamas has vowed to repeat the “atrocities” of October 7 “again and again.” Despite the war, “we will continue to facilitate humanitarian assistance, and to do our utmost to keep civilians out of harm’s way, even as Hamas uses civilians as human shields,” he says. \n             \n           The World Court on Friday ordered Israel to ensure that its military does not commit any actions that could be genocide in its campaign in Gaza against Hamas. The court, formally known as the International Court of Justice, also ordered Israel to immediately allow “urgently-needed basic services and humanitarian assistance” to the Palestinians of Gaza. Citing inflammatory rhetoric from some Israeli leaders, the court also ordered Israel to punish and prevent incitement to genocide. The court reserved judgment on the crux of the case whether Israel had committed genocide, but said that “in the court’s view, at least some of the acts and omissions alleged by South Africa have been committed by Israel in Gaza appear to be capable of falling within the provisions of the [genocide] convention”. South Africa invoked the international convention on preventing genocide to allege that Israel was committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel launched a counterattack after Hamas had attacked it killing about 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostage on October 7. Israel’s counterattack has led to the killing of about 25,000 people, many of them women and children, and the displacement of about 85 per cent of Gaza’s population of about 2 million. Israel countered South Africa’s allegations saying that it has the right to self-defence and that it took steps to protect civilians by warning them about bombings in advance so they can move out of harm’s way and even abandoning some sorties when civilians are in danger. Israeli leaders have reacted with outrage at the suggestion of genocide as the Jewish people were victims of the crime by Nazis in Europe and have found refuge in Israel.

        "text": "General Counsel Emeritus of the World Jewish Congress Menachem Rosensaft, right, gestures with Bosnian Grand Mufti Husein Kavazovic, at the Srebrenica Memorial Center, on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, in Potocari, Bosnia, Saturday, Jan. 27, 2024. Jews and Muslims from Bosnia and abroad gathered in Srebrenica Saturday to jointly observe International Holocaust Remembrance Day and promote compassion and dialogue amid rising global sectarian hatred fueled by Israel’s war in Gaza. (AP Photo/Armin Durgut)   \n         SREBRENICA, Bosnia-Herzegovina:  Jews and Muslims from Bosnia and abroad gathered in Srebrenica on Saturday to jointly observe International Holocaust Remembrance Day and to promote compassion and dialogue amid the Israel-Hamas war.  \n             The gathering was organized by the center preserving memory of Europe’s only acknowledged genocide since the Holocaust — the massacre in the closing months of Bosnia’s 1992-95 interethnic war of more than 8,000 Muslim Bosniaks in Srebrenica. The event on Saturday underscored the message that the two communities share the experience of persecution and must stay united in their commitment to peace. “Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Jews are one body, our ties are intricate, forged in hard times and times of prosperity and interaction,” said Husein Kavazović, the head of Bosnia’s Islamic Community, in his address to a group of survivors and descendants of victims of the Holocaust and the Srebrenica genocide who took part in the commemoration. \n             \n           “Both our peoples have suffered and had experienced attempts to destroy and eradicate them (and) at the present moment, when the evils of antisemitism and Islamophobia are gaining ground around Europe and the world, we must renew our vow to be good neighbors and care for one another,” he added. Menachem Rosensaft, a child of Holocaust survivors and until last summer the general counsel for the World Jewish Congress, was also in attendance. Rosensaft had repeatedly led delegations of Jewish scholars and young diplomats at ceremonies to commemorate the Srebrenica massacre that are held every July in the eastern Bosnian town. “Today, we remember. Today, we mourn. We join together in sorrow, and our tears become prayers — prayers of remembrance, but also prayers of hope,” Rosensaft told the gathering. “This commemoration is the place for us to jointly commit ourselves to doing everything in our power to prevent the horrors we remember here today from being repeated,” he added. Rosensaft recalled in his speech the stories of Bosnian Muslims who risked their lives to save their Jewish neighbours from the Nazis and, about 50 years later, Bosnian Jews saving and caring for their Muslim neighbors during the country’s internecine war. Jews settled in Bosnia in the 15th century after fleeing the Spanish Inquisition. Their thriving community was decimated by the Holocaust and today numbers around 1,000 people. “We must do all in our collective power to change the future, to prevent further destruction and violence, and to reject all manifestations of antisemitism, of Islamophobia, of bigotry, of xenophobia, and of hatred. And we must do so together,” Rosensaft said. The commemoration was followed by the launch of the Srebrenica Muslim-Jewish Peace and Remembrance Initiative devised and signed by Rosensaft and Kavazović. The signing of the initiative was witnessed by a Srebrenica massacre survivor, Munira Subašić, and the leader of Bosnia’s Jewish community, Jakob Finci, who was born in a concentration camp in 1943. Kavazović and Rosensaft committed to collaborate in times of crisis, maintain consistent and compassionate channels of communication, remember and commemorate the victims of past genocides and repudiate all forms of bigotry.",

        "text": "Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK)   \n         New Delhi:   India and Pakistan , though different pieces of the same land, have always been against each other with diplomatic animosity over most issues; the biggest being Kashmir. Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), is a part of Jammu and Kashmir, India which was overtook by Pakistan in 1947; while United Nations and other international organisations call it Pakistani-Controlled Kashmir or Pakistan Administered Kashmir, India calls it ‘ Pakistan Occupied Kashmir’ . In a new controversy with respect to the disputed area, political activists in PoK have openly protested against the Pakistan Army and have claimed that they have been treated as ‘second-class citizens’ for several decades.  \n             People, Political Activist In PoK Protest Against Pak Army As mentioned earlier, the people in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) are showing anger and resentment against Islamabad as they have been treated as second-class citizens for the past several decades. While addressing a rally in Muzaffarabad, political activists in PoK openly expressed their anger and sorrow against the Pakistan Army and the regime. Leader Of Ongoing Protests, Toqeer Gilani Said.. A prominent political activist and the leader of the ongoing protests in PoK, Toqeer Gilani, said: “The Pakistan administration has been saying that they will always stand with us, and will always fight for the rights of our people. But anyone who is friends with the Pakistani establishment, will not need a foe anyway. You may ask the Afghans, you may ask the Palestinians, and you can also ask us about the atrocities they are inflicting upon us.” Gilani also mentioned that the administration of Pakistan has been inflicting atrocities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Political Activist Questions Pakistan’s Administration “They did not even forgive the national leaders, who had served the country more than once, putting them behind bars after declaring them traitors. The administration now has fallen to breaking political parties, destroying cultures, and traditions, and capturing land everywhere,” he said in his public address. He added, “What sort of an administration is this? What sort of a democracy is this? And what sort of Islam is this? There is no bigger lie than this in the history of mankind”. \n             \n           Gilani further said: “The Pakistani administration even today is not ready to listen and grant us the freedom that we ask for. The administration continues to call us anti-Pakistan and anti-Islam. All intend to take away what belongs to us, the people of PoK. Even today, the people whose forefathers have destroyed our lands, are not letting us improve our economic condition”. In another news, as quoted by Pakistani Ambassador to Tehran in an Al Jazeera report, nine Pakistanis have been killed by gunmen at the South-Eastern border area of Iran. Pakistani ambassador to Tehran Muhammad Mudassir Tipu has also expressed his shock and has condoled the deaths. (Inputs from ANI)",

        "description": "Addressing a presser on Sunday, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said the party will present a positive agenda of Nyay in the coming days to counter the BJP's \"anyaay kaal\".",
        "text": "Congress leader Pawan Khera addresses the press conference, at AICC headquarters, in New Delhi on Sunday. (ANI Photo)   \n         New Delhi:  Opposition Congress has laid out its five pillar of ‘Nyay’ to “save” 140 crore Indians, who they claimed are “suffering” under the “anyaay kaal” imposed by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP government for the past decade.  \n             Addressing a presser on Sunday, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said the party will present a positive agenda of Nyay in the coming days to counter the BJP’s “anyaay kaal” which has been imposed on the masses. “In the days to come, the Congress party will present a positive agenda of NYAY, which our leader Rahul Gandhi has spoken about in the ‘Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra’. The five pillars of NYAY: Yuva NYAY, Bhagidari NYAY, Nari NYAY, Kisan NYAY and Shram NYAY,” Khera said. “We will ensure NYAY (justice) for the 140 crore Indians, from the 10 years of Modi government’s misrule (ANYAY),” Khera, who is also the AICC Media and Publicity chairman, added. \n             \n           ‘Failures being shrouded behind dazzling events’ Launching a scathing attack against the BJP’s Central government, the Congress leader said the saffron party has mastered the art of shrouding reality behind the dazzle of an event and that is what is happening with the country and its economy under them. “This government has mastered the art of how to shroud the reality behind the dazzle of an event. This is something we must all learn from them. The truth about the economy is that youth from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana are queuing up for jobs for fighting in Israel. This is heart-wrenching,” Khera told reporters. “Why would any person want to go to a country engaged in war and become a labourer? The answer is that their average monthly income is just Rs 10,000 (most below minimum wage) while Israel is offering almost 13-14 times that salary,” he added. ‘Anyaay Kaal’ Khera said it was unfortunate to see that there were 51 lakh applicants for only 60,000 vacancies of police constables in Uttar Pradesh. “140 crore Indians are living in ‘anyaay kaal’ imposed by the BJP’s misrule,” he said. The Congress leader said the Narendra Modi government shall in the next few days present its final Budget and the entire government machinery is being used to propagate a hollow slogan of ‘Viksit Bharat’. “And this Budget would just be an extension of this shiny, glitzy, extravagant picture of India where the finance minister would read out paragraphs and paragraphs of praise of the Pradhan Mantri ji laced with a lot of superficial claims,” Khera said. “The dazzle of this Budget speech should not blur the reality of this government,” he added. India’s economy far different from projections Citing figures to substantiate his claim that the reality of India’s economy is far different from what is projected, the Congress leader claimed that half of the Indian people (71 crore) have an income of Rs 3,87,000 per year or less, or about Rs 32,000 a month or less. The per capita monthly income of the bottom 10 per cent is just Rs 6,000 and of the bottom 11-20 per cent Rs 12,000, Khera said. In the past five years, under the Modi government, the growth rate of real rural wages has become negative for both agriculture (-0.6 per cent) and non-agriculture (-1.4 per cent), which means there is widespread rural distress, he added. Escalating his attack on the ruling dispensation, the Congress leader said the “Modi government may drumbeat about poverty numbers” but the “stark reality is different”. “According to the UNDP’s multi-dimensional poverty index, 22.8 crore people or about 16 per cent of the population are below the poverty line. (According to NITI Aayog, it is 11.28 per cent or 16.8 crore),” Khera said. In the past 10 years, the Modi government has made India the “Vishwaguru” in joblessness with a 45 year-high unemployment rate, he added. Growth in private consumption expenditure, which is a catalyst of creating jobs, is a 21-year low and FMCG sales did not see any increase in 2023, again indicating why the household savings are at a 50-year low,” the Congress leader claimed. “Even as the Modi government is busy toppling elected governments from backdoor, the Economic Distress remains precarious. This shows their priorities,” Khera said. The Congress leader said whatever optics you give, the truth comes out through these figures and one should see for themselves the state of affairs in the country when you join Rahul Gandhi’s ‘Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra’, where one meets people across the country and see their plight. “The government should be ashamed of this data that 80 crore people have to depend on free ration. This is shameful and is a report card of this government,” Khera said. (With inputs from agencies)",

        "description": "The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, employs thousands of staffers and provides vital aid and services to millions of people across the Middle East.",
        "text": "Palestinians displaced by the Israeli air and ground offensive on the Gaza Strip walk through a makeshift tent camp in Rafah on Saturday, Jan. 27, 2024. (AP Photo/Fatima Shbair)   \n         What Is UNRWA:  Israel’s allegations that 12 employees of a United Nations agency were involved in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack have led several Western countries to cut off funding and reignited debate over Gaza’s biggest humanitarian aid provider.  \n             The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, employs thousands of staffers and provides vital aid and services to millions of people across the Middle East. In Gaza, it has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians during the Israel-Hamas war. Israel has long railed against the agency, accusing it of tolerating or even collaborating with Hamas and of perpetuating the 75-year-old Palestinian refugee crisis. The Israeli government has accused Hamas and other militant groups of siphoning off aid and using U.N. facilities for military purposes. UNRWA denies those allegations and says it took swift action against the employees accused of taking part in the attack. The United States and eight other Western nations that together provided more than half of UNRWA’s budget in 2022 nevertheless suspended their funding to the agency. \n             \n           U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says 2 million Palestinians in Gaza, or 87% of the population, rely on UNRWA services that would be scaled back as soon as February if the money is not restored. WHAT IS UNRWA AND WHY WAS IT CREATED? The U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East was established to provide aid to the estimated 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding the country’s creation. The Palestinians say the refugees and their descendants, who now number nearly 6 million across the Middle East, have the right to return to their homes. Israel has refused, because if the right of return were to be fully implemented it would result in a Palestinian majority inside its borders. The fate of the refugees and their descendants was among the thorniest issues in the peace process, which ground to a halt in 2009. UNRWA operates schools, health clinics, infrastructure projects and aid programs in refugee camps that now resemble dense urban neighborhoods in Gaza, the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. It has 13,000 employees in Gaza alone, the vast majority of them Palestinians. In Gaza, where some 85% of territory’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, over 1 million are sheltering in UNRWA schools and other facilities. WHAT DO ISRAEL AND OTHER CRITICS SAY ABOUT UNRWA? Israel accuses UNRWA of turning a blind eye as Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, siphons off aid intended for civilians and fights from in and around U.N. facilities, several of which have been struck during the war. It also has exposed Hamas tunnels running next to or under UNRWA facilities and accuses the agency of teaching hatred of Israel in its schools. UNRWA denies those allegations. It says it has no links to Hamas or to any other militant groups, and that it thoroughly investigates any allegations of wrongdoing and holds staff accountable. It says it shares lists of all of its staff with Israel and other host countries. The 12 employees are said to have participated in the surprise Oct. 7 attack in which Hamas fighters from Gaza overran Israel’s extensive border defenses. Other militants joined in the subsequent rampage through nearby communities, which left 1,200 people dead, mostly civilians. Around 250 others, including children, were captured and dragged into Gaza. U.N. chief Guterres said nine of the accused UNRWA employees were immediately terminated, one was confirmed dead and the other two still need to be identified. He said all would be held accountable, including through criminal prosecution. Neither the details of the allegations nor the evidence supporting them has been made public. UNRWA has condemned the Oct. 7 attack and called for all the hostages to be freed. Earlier this month, before the latest allegations, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini announced an external review of the agency to determine which accusations are “true or untrue” and “what is politically motivated.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the agency should be shut down. But his government has continued to allow UNRWA to operate in the West Bank and Gaza, where it provides basic services that might otherwise be the responsibility of Israel as the occupying power. No other entity would be able to quickly fill the void if UNRWA ceased operations. WHAT DO THE FUNDING CUTS MEAN FOR GAZA? The United States, which was the first country to suspend funding, is the biggest donor to UNRWA, providing it with $340 million in 2022. The United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Finland have also suspended aid. The nine countries together provided nearly 60% of UNRWA’s budget in 2022. It was not immediately clear when or how the suspension of aid would affect the agency’s day-to-day operations. Norway and Ireland said they would continue funding UNRWA, while other donors have not yet made a decision. The war has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis. One in four Palestinians in the territory faces starvation, according to U.N. officials, who say aid operations are hampered by the fighting and Israeli restrictions. “Our humanitarian operation, on which 2 million people depend as a lifeline in Gaza, is collapsing,” Lazzarini posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. He expressed shock that countries would suspend aid “based on alleged behavior of a few individuals and as the war continues, needs are deepening & famine looms.” The war has killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, most women and children, and wounded more than 64,400 others, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its toll but says most of those killed were women and children. The death toll includes more than 150 UNWRA employees, the most aid workers the U.N. has lost in a single conflict.",

        "text": "Hamas said the death of the soldiers shows how the US supports Israel and it could put it at odds with the whole Muslim world.   \n         Amman:  3 American soldiers were killed in a drone attack in Syria, Jordan said on Sunday and added that a attack did not occur on its territory as Washington reported earlier but at an army base in Syria near the border. Giving details to the news agency AFP, government spokesperson Muhannad Mubaidin said the drone attack that targeted the American forces did not happen in Jordan and it targeted Al-Tanf base in Syria where US forces are deployed as part of an international anti-jihadist coalition.  \n             This is the time that American military personnel have been killed by attack in the Middle East since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, and the incident will further raise tensions in the region and fuel fears of a broader conflict directly involving Iran. “While we are still gathering the facts of this attack, we know it was carried out by radical Iran-backed groups operating in Syria and Iraq,” US President Joe Biden said in a statement on the attack. “We will carry on their commitment to fight terrorism. And have no doubt — we will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing,” the president added. \n             \n           On the other hand, Hamas said the death of the soldiers shows how the US supports Israel and it could put it at odds with the whole Muslim world if innocent lives continue to be lost in Gaza, and that the war there could lead to a “regional explosion.” Hamas spokesperson Sami Abu Zuhri said in a statement that the killing of the soldiers “is a message to the American administration that unless the killing of innocent people in Gaza stops, it may be faced with the entire (Muslim) nation.” “The continuation of the American-Zionist aggression on Gaza risks a regional explosion,” Abu Zuhri said in a statement.",

        "text": "Representative Image. (Photo/Reuters)   \n         Tehran (Iran): Iran’s Foreign Ministry refuted the claims of Tehran’s involvement in the attack on a US base in Jordan and said resistance groups decide and work on their own principles and priorities as well as the interests of their country and people, Iran’s state news agency, IRNA reported.  \n             Iran’s Foreign Ministry Spokesman, Nasser Kanaani, warned that the statements and non-constructive actions of some Western officials are threatening regional and international peace and stability \n“As we have clearly stated before, the resistance groups in the region are responding the war crimes and genocide of the child-killing Zionist regime and that they do not take orders from the Islamic Republic of Iran. These groups decide and act based on their own principles and priorities as well as the interests of their country and people”, he underlined. Additionally, Iranian Minister Kanaani advised the West to condemn the crimes of the occupying Israeli regime and work to facilitate humanitarian aid to Gaza rather than making baseless accusations against Iran, IRNA reported. \nThis comes as Kannai lashed out at British Foreign Secretary David Cameron for his anti-Tehran rhetoric and unfounded claims. \nKanaani has called baseless the UK accusation after a US base attack in Jordan that Iran has been involved in operations by resistance groups in the region. \n“These claims are made with specific political goals to reverse the realities of the region and also indicate that they are influenced by third parties, including the child-killing Zionist regime”, Kanaani noted. Cameron has posted on X, in which, he condemned the drone attack on an American base in Jordan but reiterated that Iran is involved in operations of resistance forces, a claim officials in the Islamic Republic have repeatedly called “baseless”. \n“We still urge Iran to reduce tensions in the region”, Cameron added in his post. \nThis is while the Islamic Republic has always emphasized that it does not have any proxy group in the region. \nThe drone attack marks the first instance of US troops being killed by enemy fire in the Middle East since the commencement of the Gaza war. The attack targeted Tower 22 in Jordan, near the Syrian border, escalating an already precarious situation in the region. According to US officials, the drone responsible was launched by Iran-backed militants and seemed to originate from Syria, CNN reported. \n             \n           US Central Command officially confirmed the casualties, stating that three service members were killed and 25 were injured in a one-way drone attack that struck a base in northeast Jordan. \nPresident Joe Biden vowed to hold those responsible to account, asserting that the attack was carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq. “These service members embodied the very best of our nation: unwavering in their bravery, unflinching in their duty, unbending in their commitment to our country — risking their own safety for the safety of their fellow Americans and our allies and partners with whom we stand in the fight against terrorism,” President Biden remarked.",

        "title": "Hamas Appears To Reject New Hostage Deal Offer, Insists On Full Pullout Of Israeli Soldiers",
        "description": "A senior Hamas official expressed the group's desire for a \"complete and comprehensive ceasefire\" in Gaza, a condition that seemingly contradicts earlier demands for an immediate end to hostilities.",
        "text": "New Sanctions From US Targets Hamas Officials Who Help Manage Its Financial Network   \n         Tel Aviv:  Hamas seems to have rejected a proposed framework for a hostage deal with Israel, asserting it will not accept any agreement if the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza is not included, The Times of Israel reported. The rejection came after Israel reportedly agreed to the plan during negotiations in Paris, aiming to secure the release of hostages held by the militant group.  \n             Hamas, along with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, issued a joint statement insisting that any agreement must include an end to the ongoing conflict and a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. The group emphasised that Israel must cease its “aggression” before any exchange deal can be considered, as reported by The Times of Israel. A senior Hamas official expressed the group’s desire for a “complete and comprehensive ceasefire” in Gaza, a condition that seemingly contradicts earlier demands for an immediate end to hostilities. The proposed agreement, crafted during a meeting involving heads of the Mossad and Shin Bet intelligence agencies along with US, Qatari, and Egyptian officials, outlines a phased process. \n             \n           The deal would involve the release of all Israeli hostages, starting with vulnerable groups such as women, children, the elderly, and the sick. “Phased pauses” in Israel’s offensive against Hamas would occur during the hostage release process. According to the deal, Israel would also allow more aid into Gaza and would release very large numbers of Palestinian prisoners. The Times of Israel, citing Channel 12 news, reported that the offer centres around a 45-day pause in the fighting in exchange for 35-40 hostages in the first stage. Around 100-250 Palestinian prisoners will be released for every hostage. This will be followed by further releases in exchange for an extension of the truce and a larger ratio of Palestinian security prisoner releases for each hostage. The framework reportedly does not establish a permanent ceasefire but leaves the possibility open. The agreement also includes provisions for increased humanitarian aid into Gaza and the release of a substantial number of Palestinian prisoners. While Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohamed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani expressed optimism about progress in negotiations, stating that Hamas had potentially shifted its stance, Israel remains cautious. The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office issued a statement neither confirming nor denying the existence of a deal but noted that the reports included conditions “not acceptable to Israel.” Israeli officials told The Times of Israel on Monday that they are being cautious. “There is still a long road ahead,” one official said. “We are in a much better place than we were a few weeks ago,” Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC. “Yesterday, good progress was made to get things back in shape and at least to lay a foundation for the way forward,” the Qatari PM added, saying the proposal would be relayed to Hamas. Al Thani also said that an agreement might lead to a permanent ceasefire “in the future.” The situation remains fluid, with conflicting statements from both sides, and the war cabinet in Israel is scheduled to meet to discuss the ongoing negotiations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office confirmed a four-way meeting involving the US, Israel, Qatar, and Egypt to discuss a potential deal with Hamas. The talks were deemed “constructive,” but there are still significant gaps to be addressed in subsequent meetings. “There are still significant gaps that the sides will discuss this week in additional meetings,” the PMO added. CIA Director Bill Burns discussed the emerging agreement with David Barnea, the head of the Mossad intelligence agency, Qatar’s Al Thani and Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel. It’s believed that 132 hostages abducted by Hamas on October 7 are still held in Gaza. Hamas demands an end to the war and IDF withdrawal as conditions for their release, terms Israel rejects. The war erupted on October 7, after Hamas-led terrorists from the Gaza Strip carried out a massive attack on Israel that killed nearly 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Hamas and other terrorists also abducted 253 people of all ages, mostly civilians, into Gaza. This was followed by a military campaign by Israel in Gaza which killed at least 26,637 people and 65,387 wounded. Netanyahu faces pressure from hostage families, with rallies in Tel Aviv calling for a deal. About 100 hostages were released in November under a ceasefire deal. The IDF confirmed 28 deaths among those still held by Hamas, The Times of Israel reported.",

        "description": "The diplomat-turned-politician S Jaishnakar said that if there are six issues out there, and if anyone takes one or two and if the rest four don't matter, then such an approach won't work in resolving the conflict.",
        "text": "The EAM said the overall balance should remain in favour of freedom, openness, and rules-based order.   \n         New Delhi:  Amid the ongoing Israel-Palestine war, the debate over the existence of Palestine still continues across the world and various countries around the world have taken respective stands on it. Continuing this debate, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has stated that India favours a two-state solution to end the decades-long Israel-Palestine conflict. Moreover, S Jaishankar also stated that the conflict in West Asia must be viewed in totality rather than in isolation. Notably, he termed the Hamas’ deadly incursions inside Israel, which occurred four months ago, a terrorist attack, as per a report by news agency PTI.  \n             India’s Stand On Two-state Solution Continues Replying to a question at an interaction with students of the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Mumbai, Jaishankar said, “It is certainly the view of India and a very large number of countries that (the problem can only be solved through a two-state solution and that there has to be a Palestinian state side-by-side with the state of Israel.” “So for us today, there are all the aspects. We cannot take one aspect and say that’s the only aspect because if you see the debate in the world in a way, that is what people are doing,” he said. The diplomat-turned-politician maintained that if there are six issues out there, and if anyone takes one or two and if the rest four don’t matter, then such an approach won’t work in resolving the conflict. “I think that is not helpful. I think we have to look at the totality of all these issues and strike the right balance and that is really, in a way, what we are trying,” he added. \n             \n           Jaishankar said what happened on October 7, 2023, was a terrorist attack, referring to Hamas militants launching a series of assaults inside Israel after storming across the border. About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the attacks, while nearly 250 Israelis and other nationals were taken hostage by Hamas. “I don’t think there should be confusion on that and as a country that has itself experienced so much terrorism, I think it’s important that we recognise that and express our solidarity with Israel as another victim of terrorism,” noted the External Affairs Minister. Israel’s Strong Response To Hamas Attacks On Israel’s strong response to the Hamas attacks, which triggered a war in the Gaza Strip, he said that when any country responds, it is equally important to observe international laws, and he called for avoiding civilian casualties. The nearly four-month-long war has killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, destroyed vast swaths of the Gaza Strip, a tiny but densely populated Palestinian enclave, and displaced nearly 85 per cent of the territory’s population. Israel says its air and ground offensive has killed more than 9,000 militants. “Every effort should be made to ideally avoid or limit civilian casualties,” Jaishankar insisted. Where there is a situation in which civilians are affected, which is the case today (in the Israel-Hamas war) very manifestly in Gaza, there has to be some kind of sustainable humanitarian corridor that will deal with it, Jaishankar said.

        "description": "The IDF says that its forces along with the Israeli Ministry of Defense have been using various tools to flood the subterranean network of tunnels Hamas has been using in the Gaza Strip in order to drive out terrorists hiding there.",
        "text": "A map provided by the IDF that shows the tunnel system it uncovered in the Bani Suheila neighborhood in southern Gaza. (Israel Defense Forces)   \n         Israel’s military declared on Tuesday that it has pumped seawater to flood the Hamas underground tunnel network in the Gaza Strip. It was the first time that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) officially acknowledged using the controversial strategy, which some United Nations hydrologists and environmental experts warned could destroy the majority of Gaza’s drinkable water and harm agriculture.  \n             The IDF says that its forces along with the Israeli Ministry of Defense have been using various tools to flood the subterranean network of tunnels Hamas has been using in the Gaza Strip in order to drive out terrorists hiding there. The flooding had been considered an open secret for weeks but the IDF finally confirmed the strategy on Tuesday. “The pumping of water was only carried out in tunnel routes and locations that were suitable, matching the method of operation to each case,” the IDF said in a statement. “This project was developed following combat procedures, accelerated force-building efforts, and while training forces with technological expertise.” “This tool represents a significant engineering and technological breakthrough in combating the threat of underground terror infrastructure and is the result of a collaborative effort between various bodies in Israel’s security establishment,” the IDF added. \n             \n           The IDF said this strategy represents a significant engineering and technological breakthrough in combating the threat of Hamas’ underground terror infrastructure and is the result of a collaborative effort between various bodies in Israel’s security establishment. The statement clarified that tools such as pumps and pipes were employed and emphasised that the water pumping was executed selectively in tunnel routes deemed suitable for this method. The move has raised concerns about the safety of hostages believed to be held underground in Gaza. When discussions about flooding tunnels first emerged in December, experts expressed apprehensions about potential risks, including the contamination of freshwater supplies and damage to surface-level infrastructure, CNN reported. The IDF did not go into further detail about the flooding of the tunnels. However, the Wall Street Journal reported last month that Israel had constructed five large seawater pumps completed in November about one mile north of the Al-Shati refugee camp. Each pump is capable of drawing water from the Mediterranean Sea and can move thousands of cubic meters of water per hour, which would flood the tunnels within weeks, the report said. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group controlling Gaza, downplayed the potential success of Israel’s tactic, asserting that its tunnel network was designed to withstand such flooding. According to that report, Israel had identified about 800 tunnels beneath Gaza that Hamas had been using to move fighters, store weapons and plan terror attacks on Israel. However, Israeli officials believe the tunnel network is much larger. \n A report sent by IDF troops earlier this month said it was likely Hamas “used more than 6,000 tons of concrete and 1,800 tons of metal to build hundreds of miles of underground infrastructure.” \n It is unclear how many tunnels have been flooded by Israeli forces and how many Hamas terrorists have been caught or killed as part of the operations.",

        "description": "Has the Israel Hamas War now changed into an 'Israel vs Israel' Conflict? Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has threatened to topple the government if...",
        "text": "National Security Minister of Israel, Itamar Ben-Gvir   \n         New Delhi:  The  Israel Hamas War  has been going on for more than three months now and the devastating attacks do not seem to stop. The ongoing  Israel Palestine Conflict  turned into the deadly Israel Hamas War when the latter fired 5000 rockets from Gaza to Israel on  October 7 , 2023; Israel immediately decided to counter-attack and since then, the war has not stopped. Thousands of lives, on both sides of the war have been lost including women and children; despite objections from other countries and international organisations, the war has continued. However, there have been a few ‘pauses’ in the war for the release of hostages from both sides. But now it seems that the ‘Israel Hamas War’ is turning into an  ‘Israel vs Israel’ War  with the passing time as the  National Security Minister of Israel, Itamar Ben-Gvir  has threatened to topple the government. Know the reason behind it…  \n             Israel’s National Security Minister Threatens To Topple Govt As mentioned earlier, Israel’s National Security Minister, Otzma Yehudit Party leader Itamar Ben-Gvir, threatened on Tuesday to bring down the government if it reaches a “reckless” hostage deal with Hamas. His tweet came amid apparent progress on an agreement to free the 136 captives remaining in Gaza whom the terrorist group abducted during its October 7 attack on communities near the Strip. Opposition Leader Yair Lapid Responds In an apparent response to Ben-Gvir’s tweet, opposition leader Yair Lapid wrote on X that his Yesh Atid Party and its 24 Knesset members would give the government full backing for a deal to free the hostages. “In the last 116 days, I met with dozens of families of abductees. I promised them and I repeat my promise: We will give the government a safety net for any deal that will return the abductees to their homes and families. This is our commitment to the abductees and their families, this is our commitment,” Lapid wrote in a lengthy series of tweets. Hamas Political Bureau Chief Ismail Haniyeh On Peace Talks Qatar-based Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh said on Tuesday that the terrorist group would study a proposal received from negotiations between the interested parties in Paris on Sunday, adding that he would visit Cairo for talks on the initiative. Haniyeh said that the priority for Hamas is an end to Israel’s military offensive in Gaza and a withdrawal of all troops from the coastal enclave. The demand to end the war runs counter to Israel’s stated goal of destroying the terrorist group. On the other hand, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office has ‘defined’ the Paris meeting as ‘constructive’. However, “there are still significant gaps which the sides will continue to discuss at additional mutual meetings to be held this week.” \n             \n           Qatari and Egyptians Mediators brought togeter Mossad Chief David Barnea, Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) Director Ronen Bar and the Israel Defense Forces’ point man Maj. Gen. Nitzan Alon for hostage negotiations at the Paris Talks. To mediate the meeting, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Abbas Kamel, head of the Egyptian General Intelligence Directorate, and CIA Director William Burns were also present. What Is The New Israel Hamas Hostage Deal? Various unconfirmed reports say that this new agreement would include the release of more than 100 hostages and there might be a ceasefire of two months; prison sentences of unspecified number of Palestinian terrorists would be commuted and amount of humanitarian aid being brought to the Gaza Strip would be increased by Israel.

The protesters urge the government to renew hostage negotiations with Gaza’s Hamas rulers, whom it has vowed to destroy. Israel could also face pressure to scale back major combat operations when U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin visits Monday. Washington is expressing growing unease with civilian casualties even while as it provides vital military and diplomatic support.  \n             The war has flattened large parts of northern Gaza, killed thousands of civilians and driven most of the population to the southern part of the besieged territory, where many are in crowded shelters and tent camps. Some 1.9 million Palestinians — nearly 85% of Gaza’s population — have fled their homes. They survive off a trickle of humanitarian aid. Israel said that starting Sunday, U.N. aid trucks would be able to enter Gaza from a second location, Kerem Shalom, in Israel. Dozens of desperate Palestinians surrounded aid trucks after they drove in through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, forcing some to stop before climbing aboard, pulling down boxes and carrying them off. Other trucks appeared to be guarded by masked people carrying sticks. \n             \n           Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel “will continue to fight until the end,” with the goal of eliminating Hamas, which triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel. Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and captured scores of hostages. Netanyahu vowed to bring back the estimated 129 hostages still in captivity. Anger over the mistaken killing of hostages is likely to increase pressure on him to renew Qatar-mediated negotiations with Hamas over swapping more of the remaining captives for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. Gaza, meanwhile, saw telecom services gradually resume after a four-day communications blackout, the longest of several outages during the war. Aid groups say they complicate rescue efforts and make it more difficult to monitor the toll on civilians. CALLS FOR A NEW CEASE-FIRE In Israel on Sunday, French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna called for an “immediate truce” aimed at releasing more hostages, getting larger amounts of aid into Gaza and moving toward “the beginning of a political solution.” France’s Foreign Ministry earlier said an employee was killed in an Israeli strike on a home in Rafah on Wednesday. It condemned the strike, which it said killed several civilians, and demanded clarification from Israeli authorities. The foreign ministers of the U.K. and Germany, meanwhile, called for a “sustainable” cease-fire, saying too many civilians had been killed. “Israel will not win this war if its operations destroy the prospect of peaceful co-existence with Palestinians,” British Foreign Secretary David Cameron and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock wrote in the U.K.’s Sunday Times. The U.S. defense secretary is set to travel to Israel to continue discussions on a timetable for ending the war’s most intense phase. Israeli and U.S. officials have spoken of a transition to more targeted strikes aimed at killing Hamas leaders and rescuing hostages, without saying when it would occur. Hamas has said no more hostages will be released until the war ends, and that in exchange it will demand the release of large numbers of Palestinian prisoners, including high-profile militants. Hamas released over 100 of more than 240 hostages captured on Oct. 7 in exchange for the release of scores of Palestinian prisoners during a brief cease-fire in November. Nearly all freed on both sides were women and minors. Israel has rescued one hostage. The Israeli military said Sunday it had discovered a large tunnel in Gaza close to what was once a busy crossing into Israel, raising new questions about how Israeli surveillance missed such conspicuous attack preparations by Hamas. SHOOTINGS DRAW SCRUTINY Military officials said Saturday that the three hostages who were mistakenly shot by Israeli troops had tried to signal that they posed no harm. It was Israel’s first such acknowledgement of harming hostages in the war. The hostages, all in their 20s, were killed Friday in the Gaza City area of Shijaiyah, where troops are engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas. An Israeli military official said the shootings were against the army’s rules of engagement and were being investigated at the highest level. Israel says it makes every effort to avoid harming civilians and accuses Hamas of using them as human shields. But Palestinians and rights groups have repeatedly accused Israeli forces of recklessly endangering civilians and firing on those who do not threaten them, both in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, which has seen a surge of violence since the war began. Pope Francis on Sunday called for peace, saying “unarmed civilians are being bombed and shot at, and this has even happened inside the Holy Family parish complex, where there are no terrorists but families, children and sick people with disabilities, nuns.” He spoke after the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said two Christian women at a church compound in Gaza were killed by Israeli sniper fire. A British lawmaker, Layla Moran, said several family members were among hundreds sheltering in the compound. “This is a church. It’s a week before Christmas. This is Advent. This is an important time in the Christian family’s religious calendar. And there is a sniper killing women and firing at children,” she asserted. In Gaza, Palestinians on several occasions have said Israeli soldiers opened fire at fleeing civilians. The offensive has killed more than 18,700 Palestinians, the Health Ministry in the Hamas-run territory said Thursday in its last update before the communications blackout. It has said that thousands more casualties are buried under the rubble. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths, but has said that most of those killed were women and children. On Sunday, five people were killed and many injured after a reported Israeli airstrike hit near a U.N.-run school in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis where displaced Palestinians were sheltering. A cameraman with The Associated Press counted five bodies delivered to a hospital. The plight of Palestinian civilians has gotten little attention inside Israel, where many are still deeply traumatized by the Oct. 7 attack and where support for the war remains strong. Israel’s military says 121 of its soldiers have been killed in the Gaza offensive. It says it has killed thousands of militants, without providing evidence. (Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "description": "During the ongoing Israel-Hamas War, the Israeli Defence Forces have claimed that they have uncovered the biggest tunnel system of the Islamist organisation which was led by the brother of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.",
        "text": "Israel Hamas War IDF Uncover Biggest Hamas Tunnel   \n         New Delhi:  The Israel-Hamas War has been going on for more than two months and it unfortunately does not seem to stop anytime soon; the war which started as the Israel Palestine Conflict has taken the lives of many thousands of people and continues to do so. The decades-long conflict turned into a full-fledged war when Hamas fired 5000 rockets at Israel from the Gaza Strip on October 6, 2023 and since then, apart from a few days of ceasefire, the war has not stopped and so hasn’t the destruction and devastation. Amid the ongoing war, the IDF has now claimed to have uncovered the biggest tunnel system of Hamas which was led by Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s brother. Know all about it..  \n             Hamas’ Biggest Tunnel System Uncovered By IDF As mentioned earlier, amid the ongoing tension between Israel and Hamas, a massive tunnel system was discovered by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) on Sunday, which the IDF claimed to be Hamas’ biggest tunnel system, the construction of which was led by Mohammad Sinwar, brother of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. It is pertinent to note that the tunnel has a length of over four kilometers (2.5 miles), and is located only 400 meters from the Erez Crossing, said the IDF. ‘EXPOSED Biggest Hamas Terrorist Tunnel’, Says Israeli Forces In a post on X, IDF also said that Gazans used the giant tunnel on a daily basis to enter Israel for work and medical treatment in Israeli hospitals. “EXPOSED: The biggest Hamas terrorist tunnel discovered. This massive tunnel system branches out and spans well over four kilometers (2.5 miles). Its entrance is located only 400 meters (1,310 feet) from the Erez Crossing–used by Gazans on a daily basis to enter Israel for work and medical treatment in Israeli hospitals,” read IDF’s latest post on X. “This tunnel system was a project led by Mohammad Sinwar, the brother of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, and the commander of Hamas’ Khan Yunis Battalion,” it added. PM Netanyahu On ‘Demilitarisation’ Of Gaza Stressing achieving “demilitarisation” of Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he will never allow Palestinian authority to return to the strip, adding that there will be a ‘civil government’ that won’t educate children about “destroying Israel,” Times of Israel reported. He said that Israel won’t allow ‘Hamastan’ to turn into ‘Fatahstan’ even if this is the wish of Israel’s “staunchest ally,” referring to the US. Netanyahu also cited a survey that found 82 per cent of Palestinians in the West Bank justified the October 7 attacks on Israel, adding that the Palestinian authority has yet to condemn the assault. “They should control Gaza?” he asked, referring to the Palestinian Authority, and stressed that he “won’t let that happen.” \n             \n           Israeli PM’s Vision For Gaza After War On being asked about his vision for Gaza after the war, Netanyahu said, “I said there will be demilitarisation. I said the IDF will be responsible for security in the Gaza Strip because there is no other factor that will ensure the fight against terrorism. And I can tell you that there will be a civil government that does not educate its children to destroy Israel…I’m very clear on this.” He further said that it was “only military pressure” that secured the release of hostages in last month’s truce and only military pressure will secure the release of the rest of the hostages as well. “Without it, we have nothing,” he added. The Israeli PM also stressed the diplomatic situation on the northern border of Israel after the IDF achieved a “crushing victory” over Hamas. “First, there needs to be ‘crushing victory’ over Hamas, with Hezbollah deterred in the north, he says. Once Hamas is destroyed, Israel will focus on the north, where almost 100,000 Israelis are currently displaced from their homes,” Netanyahu said. “Either there will be a diplomatic situation on the northern border, or there will be a different way to solve the situation,” he added.

        "text": "Iran Executes 229 People Over Anti-Hijab Protests, UN Calls It ‘Alarming’ | What We Know So Far    \n         Tehran:  In a significant development, Iran has launched a series of executions targeting activists and ethnic minorities. So far, Iran has executed at least 229 people as Tehran is targeting protesters following the uprising after the death of Mahsa Amini. In a statement, Iran said it had executed a man who was sentenced to death after being convicted of working with Israel’s intelligence services According to Iranian authorities, the man was found guilty of “collecting and providing classified information to the Mossad spy service with the aim of disrupting public order”.  \n             What UN Has To Day About Executions In Iran? The UN in November this year warned that Iran was carrying out executions “at an alarming rate.” So far, 419 people have been executed in the first seven months of the year, a 30 per cent increase from the same period in 2022. It was reported that the Kurdish and Baluchi minorities have been among the major victims of the killing spree. Among those who were executed include two women and one child, who were killed in November. What Rights Groups Say On Iran Executions? Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for opposition group the People’s Mojahedin Organisation of Iran (MEK), said Iran is involved in a war with the people of Iran itself to prevent another uprising inside the country- referring to September 2022 protests after Mahsa Amini’s death in the custody of Tehran’s morality police. \n             \n           More than 500 civilians in the protests were reportedly killed while thousands more were arrested arbitrarily, according to Iranian activists.",

        "text": "Egypt's el-Sisi Re-Elected President For Third Term; PM Modi Congratulates (File photo)   \n         Cairo:  Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi appears poised for a resounding triumph in the country’s presidential elections scheduled for Monday, securing a mandate for a third term at the helm of the Middle East’s most populous nation, according to ANI’s latest report.  \n             Following the counting of votes between December 10 and 12, the National Elections Authority of Egypt said that Sisi won 89.6 per cent of the votes. Turnout reached an “unprecedented” 66.8 per cent of voters, said authority head Hazem Badawy. Moreover, over 39 million Egyptians cast their ballots for Sisi, a former army chief who has ruled the most populous Arab country for a decade, according to Al Jazeera. Amid Egypt dealing with several crises, including the Israel-Hamas war in neighbouring Gaza and the country’s worst-ever economic crisis, Sisi won, even though the result was in little doubt. Reportedly, despite Egypt’s challenges, a decade-long crackdown on dissent has eliminated any serious opposition to Sisi, the fifth president to emerge from within the ranks of the military since 1952, reported Al Jazeera. Sisi was running against three other candidates, none of whom were high-profile, according to Al Jazeera. However, he ended his run complaining that his campaign had been impeded and that dozens of his supporters had been arrested. Moreover, runner-up Hazem Omar, who leads the Republican People’s Party, received 4.5 per cent of the vote. \n             \n           The next came Farid Zahran, leader of the left-leaning Egyptian Social Democratic Party, and Abdel-Sanad Yamama from the Wafd, a century-old but relatively marginal party, according to Al Jazeera. \nSisi is now set to serve his third—and, according to the constitution, final—term in office, which will begin in April. However, in both previous elections, Sisi won with 97 per cent of the vote. \nSisi extended the presidential mandate from four to six years and amended the constitution to raise the limit on consecutive terms in office from two to three, Al Jazeera reported. Notably, under Sisi’s rule, Egypt has jailed thousands of political prisoners, and while a presidential pardons committee has freed about 1,000 in one year, rights groups said that three to four times, many were arrested over the same period. PM Modi Congratulates el-Sisi On Being Re-elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday congratulated Egypt presidential election winner Abdel Fattah el-Sisi for the third time and expressed his hope to further deepen the strategic partnership between the two countries. Taking to X, PM Modi said, “Warm congratulations, Excellency @AlsisiOfficial on your victory in the Presidential elections. Look forward to working with you to further deepen India-Egypt Strategic Partnership.” Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is headed towards a landslide victory in Egypt’s presidential elections on Monday securing a third term as leader of the Middle East’s most populous nation, Al Jazeera reported. Following the counting of votes between December 10 and 12, the National Elections Authority of Egypt said that Sisi won 89.6 per cent of the votes. (With inputs from agencies)",

        "text": "This statement follows a report by The New York Times titled \"Strangers in Their Own Land: Being Muslim in Modi's India.\"   \n         Washington : The US State Department has expressed its willingness to engage with India in resolving ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Stating that New Delhi is a major partner of Washington, the US State Department spokesperson Mathew Miller said that the United States would welcome any “constructive engagement” from India regarding resolving the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.  \n             US State Department said on Monday (local time) said that Secretary of State Antony Blinken has a “close productive working relationship” with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, adding that the Biden administration has focused a “great deal of time and attention” on the ties with India. Addressing the daily press briefing, Miller said, “The secretary (Blinken) has a close productive working relationship with his, counterpart (Jaishankar). We have welcomed him here in the past couple of months. And of course, the secretary has travelled to India twice, just since September. President Biden has travelled to India this year”. India is a major partner of the US, and the Biden administration has focused a great deal of time and attention on ties with India.

Earlier, EAM Jaishankar went on a nine-day-long visit to the US in September. “India and the US: Expanding Horizons,” Jaishankar posted on X (formerly Twitter) after concluding his visit. During his visit, Jaishankar held meetings with top US officials, namely; Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, Trade Representative Katherine Tai, and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. He also met members of Congress, administration, business and think tank heads at India House there. He also had ‘productive discussions’ with think tanks in Washington, DC, discussing India-US collaboration in the emerging technology space and building resilient supply chains. Prior to this, US President Joe Biden also came to India for the G20 Summit during New Delhi’s presidency. He held a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and stressed the need for further expanding ties for a comprehensive strategic partnership. PM Modi went on a state visit to the US in June this year. He received a rousing welcome at the White House. He also held a bilateral meeting with President Biden, after which the two countries signed several new initiatives.",

        "description": "Justice Divyesh Joshi also observed that the actual incidences of violence against women in India are probably much higher than what the data suggests, and women may continue to face hostility and remain in environments where they are subject to violence.",
        "text": "Representative Image   \n         Ahmedabad:  A rape is a rape, even when it is committed by a man on his wife, the Gujarat High Court has observed, highlighting how several countries have criminalised marital rape. Citing that the silence shrouding sexual violence against women in India needs to be broken, single-judge Justice Divyesh Joshi in his December 8 order, pointed out that marital rape is illegal in fifty American States, three Australian States, New Zealand, Canada, Israel, France, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia and several other nations.  \n             \n \n “In most of the cases of such a nature, the usual practice is that if the man is the husband, performing the very same acts that of another man, he is exempted. In my considered view, the same cannot be be countenanced. A man is a man; an act is an act; rape is rape, be it performed by a man the ‘husband’ on the woman the ‘wife’,” Justice Joshi underlined.     \n Justice Divyesh Joshi also observed that the actual incidences of violence against women in India are probably much higher than what the data suggests, and women may continue to face hostility and remain in environments where they are subject to violence.  \n Social attitude typically characterises certain behaviours such as stalking, eve-teasing, shades of verbal and physical assault, and harassment as “minor” offences, which are “regrettably” not only trivialised or normalised but even romanticised and promoted in popular lore such as cinema, the order stated. The attitudes which view sexual crimes through the prism of “boys will be boys” and condone them, nevertheless, “have a lasting and pernicious effect on the survivors”, it said. \n             \n            \n The court made these observations while rejecting the regular bail plea of a woman arrested for subjecting her daughter-in-law to cruelty and criminal intimidation while her husband and son raped and filmed her nude to post videos on pornography sites to earn money.  \n “In most of the cases of (assault or rape on a woman), the usual practice is that if the man is the husband, performing the very same acts as that of another man, he is exempted. In my considered view, the same cannot be countenanced. A man is a man; an act is an act; rape is a rape, be it performed by a man, the “husband”, on the woman, “wife”, the court said.  \n The Constitution treats a woman as equal to a man and considers marriage as an association of equals, the order stated. Gender violence is “most often unseen and is shrouded in a culture of silence”, and the causes and factors of violence against women include entrenched unequal power equations between men and women, “aggravated by cultural and social norms, economic dependence, poverty and alcohol consumption, etc”, it said  \n The Court therefore, opined that the ‘silence’ on gender violence is needed to be broken.  \n “Gender violence is most often unseen and is shrouded in a culture of silence. The causes and factors of violence against women include entrenched unequal power equations between men and women that foster violence and it’s acceptability, aggravated by cultural and social norms, economic dependence, poverty and alcohol consumption,” the judge observed.  \n “In India, the culprits are often known to the woman; the social and economic “costs” of reporting such crimes are high. General economic dependence on family and fear of social ostracisation act as significant disincentives for women to report any kind of sexual violence, abuse or abhorrent behaviour,” it observed.",

        "text": "Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi (File Image)   \n         New Delhi : Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday spoke with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu on phone and talked about the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. PM Modi also expressed concern over the safety of maritime traffic.  \n             In a telephonic conversation with Netanyahu, PM Modi also highlighted India’s advocacy for the peaceful resolution of conflict in the Middle Eastern region and assured continued humanitarian assistance for suffering people. Taking to X, PM Modi shared his conversation with Netanyahu saying, “Had a productive exchange of views with PM @netanyahu on the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, including shared concerns on the safety of maritime traffic. Highlighted India’s consistent stand in favour of early restoration of peace & stability in the region with continued humanitarian assistance for the affected.” Moreover, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office also shared about their conversation and said, “The two leaders spoke about the importance of safeguarding the free shipping in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait that is threatened by the Houthis at the behest of Iran, and the global interest in preventing harm to international trade, including the economies of Israel and India,” The Times of Israel reported. \n             \n           The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says that at least 19,667 Palestinians have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war in the Strip since October 7. According to the ministry, 52,586 people in Gaza have been wounded in more than two months of fighting, The Times of Israel reported. The figures cannot be verified and Hamas does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. It also discriminates between those killed by Israel and those killed by the hundreds of rockets it fired that fell short in Gaza. Israel said it has killed more than 7,000 terrorists inside Gaza. The war was sparked when Hamas invaded southern Israel, killing more than 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and taking some 240 hostages. Yemen’s Houthi rebels have claimed to have launched a drone attack on two cargo vessels in the Red Sea, disrupting maritime trade and causing freight companies to avoid the area, Al Jazeera reported. Houthi spokesperson Yahya Sarea identified the vessels as the MSC Clara and Norwegian-owned Swan Atlantic and said the attacks were carried out after their crews failed to respond to calls from the group, according to Al Jazeera. Notably, the Iran-backed Houthis have attacked numerous vessels over recent weeks, saying they are targeting ships in the Red Sea “with links to Israel” in protest against its military offensive in Gaza. The group has warned against sailing towards the area, Al Jazeera reported. The attacks have caused concerns about the impact on the passage of oil, grain and other goods on what is an important global trade route, and they have pushed up the cost of insuring and shipping goods through the Red Sea. About 40 per cent of international trade passes through the narrow strait between Yemen and northeast Africa, which leads northwards to the Red Sea, Israel’s southern port facilities and the Suez Canal. In a major development, oil major BP temporarily paused all transit through the Red Sea, citing security concerns. The alternative route for ships avoiding the Suez Canal is to take a much longer trip around Africa. Last week, the US announced that it was in talks with other countries to set up a task force to protect the trade route. An Italian source on Monday reported that the country is considering joining a naval coalition to patrol the Red Sea, Al Jazeera reported. (With inputs from ANI)",

The war has been raging on for more than three months now and in the course of this violence, there has been irrepairable loss, including the loss of life as thousands of people have been killed on both sides. Some time ago, there was a ceasefire for a few days so that hostages on both sides could be freed but soon after, the war resumed and so did the killings. In a latest news update, a week-long ceasefire has been proposed to Hamas, by Israel as part of a new hostage deal. Know all about it…  \n             Israel Proposes Week-Long Ceasefire As mentioned earlier, Israel has proposed to Hamas a week-long cessation of war in Gaza for the release of 40 hostages, CNN reported. Michael Herzog, Israeli Ambassador to the United States, acknowledges Israel’s readiness for a pause in fighting to maximise hostage releases but refrains from confirming a finalised deal. According to the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health, Israeli military actions in Gaza since October 7 have resulted in nearly 20,000 deaths and over 52,000 injuries. Israeli Ambassador To US Says.. “I think it’s premature to tell whether or not we have a deal because, until now, Hamas refused to do another deal,” Herzog told CNN. “They were hoping for a permanent ceasefire, but I hope that under the pressure of what we’re doing on the ground, plus the pressure from the Qataris, they will agree to do a deal, but it’s premature at this phase,” he said. Hamas insists on a ceasefire before releasing more hostages. The ongoing diplomatic efforts occur amid a worsening humanitarian crisis in the besieged strip. According to the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health, Israeli military actions in Gaza since October 7 have resulted in nearly 20,000 deaths and over 52,000 injuries. Meanwhile, UNICEF spokesperson James Elder has expressed deep concern about the safety of children and families in Gaza’s hospitals, emphasising that they are not secure amid the recent shelling. \n             \n           UNICEF Spokesperson On Safety Of Children UNICEF spokesperson James Elder has expressed deep concern about the safety of children and families in Gaza’s hospitals, emphasising that they are not secure amid the recent shelling. “Over the past 48 hours, the largest remaining fully",

        "text": "UNSC Delays Vote On Resolution Calling For More Humanitarian Aid Into Gaza As Biden Mulls Support    \n         Washington:  The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) delayed for the third time this week the vote on a resolution calling for a suspension in fighting and encouraging more humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.  The delay was at the request of the United States to allow more time for more negotiations, according to diplomats. The postponement came after intense closed-door consultations failed to bring the United States and other members of the Council closer to a consensus.  \n             As per CNN, the delay comes as another sign of the US’ hesitancy regarding a resolution that could be interpreted as a rebuke of Israel’s continuing military campaign in Gaza. The vote was originally scheduled for early this week. It has been delayed until Thursday. A diplomatic source told CNN that key issues with the draft that remain in negotiation are the “cessation of hostilities” language and the call for the UN to “establish a monitoring mechanism in the Gaza Strip with the necessary personnel and equipment, under the authority of the United Nations Secretary-General.” The draft resolution “demands” that the parties to the conflict “allow, facilitate and enable the immediate, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale directly to the Palestinian civilian population throughout the Gaza Strip” by the most direct routes. It also “calls for the urgent suspension of hostilities” to allow safe and unhindered aid access and for urgent steps toward a “sustainable cessation of hostilities. \n             \n           The resolution also calls for a future two-state solution in which Gaza and the West Bank are unified under the Palestinian Authority and also spells out deep concern for the “dire and rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation” in Gaza and its “grave impact on the civilian population.”It specifies that civilians in Gaza do not have adequate access to sufficient “food, water, sanitation, electricity, telecommunications and medical services essential for their survival. “It also calls on Israel to promptly and fully implement the announced opening of the Kerem Shalom Border crossing to allow direct delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza, as per CNN.",

        "description": "The truce would be open to extension if there is agreement on new conditions for further releases and that the proposals had been discussed between Qatar and Israel with the knowledge of the US administration.",
        "text": "This handout picture provided by the Iranian foreign ministry on December 20, 2023, shows Qatar-based Hamas politburo leader Ismail Haniyeh speaking to journalists as he welcomes the Iranian foreign minister (not in the picture), in Doha. (Photo by Iranian Foreign Ministry / AFP)   \n         New Delhi:  The leader of Hamas made his first visit to Egypt for more than a month on Wednesday, a rare personal intervention in diplomacy amid the ongoing war with Israel. The talks have been widely reported to be set to focus on a possible ceasefire or truce in the Israel-Hamas war and a deal to release hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian security prisoners in Israeli jails.  \n             Haniyeh was due to meet Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel and other officials for talks on “stopping the aggression and the war to prepare an agreement for the release of prisoners,” a source close to the terror group told AFP. Haniyeh, based in Qatar, was accompanied by a “high-level” Hamas delegation and was set to discuss “the delivery of humanitarian aid, the withdrawal of the Israeli army from the Gaza Strip and the return of displaced persons to their towns and villages in the north,” the source added. The news agency reported that the Egypt talks would focus on proposals including a weeklong truce that would see the release of 40 Israeli hostages, including women, children and male noncombatants. Similar details were reported Tuesday night by Axios. \n             \n           The truce would be open to extension if there is agreement on new conditions for further releases, the source said, adding that the proposals had been discussed between Qatar and Israel with the knowledge of the US administration. Haniyeh’s visit is his second to Egypt since Hamas’s brutal October 7 onslaught, which triggered the ongoing war. He made a previous trip in early November. Hamas leaders have publicly said they will only free hostages in exchange for a permanent ceasefire, though reports in recent days have indicated talks for another short-term truce to release more hostages may be advancing. The terror group, which rules Gaza, sent thousands of gunmen into Israel on October 7, who killed around 1,200 people and took some 240 hostages, mostly civilians. It is believed that 128 hostages remain in Gaza — not all of them alive — after 105 civilians were released from Hamas captivity during a weeklong truce in late November. Four hostages were released prior to that, and one was rescued by troops. The bodies of eight hostages have also been recovered along with three hostages who were mistakenly killed by the military. The Israel Defense Forces has confirmed the deaths of 21 of those still held by Hamas, citing new intelligence and findings obtained by troops operating in Gaza. During a truce that ran from November 24 to December 1, international agencies were able to ship in desperately needed aid. Israel released 240 Palestinian prisoners and Hamas returned 100 Israelis and others taken captive during its attacks on October 7, which killed around 1,200 and sparked Israel’s vicious retaliation on the enclave. Hamas took a total of 240 Israeli captives in an unprecedented assault on Israeli territory on October 7 that also killed 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, Israel says, kicking off the current war.

        "description": "UNESCO wrote that the number of journalists killed in war zones has doubled compared to the last three years, adding that at least two journalist deaths had occurred in each of the following countries: Afghanistan, Syria, Cameroon, and Ukraine.",
        "text": "UNESCO Declares 2023 Deadliest Year For Journalists In War-Torn Countries   \n         Kabul:  In its yearly evaluation, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) has determined that 2023 was the deadliest year for journalists covering war-torn nations, according to a TOLOnews report. UNESCO wrote that the number of journalists killed in war zones has doubled compared to the last three years, adding that at least two journalist deaths had occurred in each of the following countries: Afghanistan, Syria, Cameroon, and Ukraine.  \n             Audrey Azoulay, UNESCO Director-General, in this press release said: “I pay tribute to all of these media professionals and reiterate my call to all actors involved to mobilize the necessary means to guarantee the protection of journalists as civilians, as stipulated in international law.” However, the Taliban refuted the claims made by UNESCO and said that no journalist has been killed in Afghanistan in the past year. “In the past year, no journalist has died, and Israel has the highest number and statistics in this area,… a large number of journalists were killed in Gaza, and this crime is the responsibility of the countries that support Israel and they should be questioned. In Afghanistan We have no casualties from the media and media people,” Zabiullah Mujahid, a senior Taliban official said, according to TOLOnews. Meanwhile, a few journalists requested that the Taliban handle the issues facing journalists in the nation more effectively. “Since journalists in the current situation are a reliable bridge between the people and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, our request is that in terms of ensuring the security of journalists and providing work facilities in the city and in news centres with the journalists of the Islamic Emirate, we should have serious cooperation so that journalists can do their work efficiently and with a peaceful mind,” said Daud Nazari, a journalist, TOLOnews reported. \n             \n           “We want the current government to pay serious attention to the safety of journalists,” said Sayed Hashem Kashefi, a journalist. The Afghan Independent Journalists Association (AIJA), however, expressed optimism that the issues facing journalists will be resolved in the next year. “We are trying to make 2024 a good year for Afghan journalists and media,” said Farhad Behroz, deputy head of the Afghan Independent Journalists Association. Recently, the Pakistani government’s deportation of unauthorised Afghan migrants has drawn criticism from Reporters Without Borders (RSF), which has said that 200 Afghan journalists are now in danger of being deported as well, according to Khaama Press. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said in a statement that they have spoken with a number of journalists who have reported experiencing severe violence as a result of the Pakistani government’s decision to remove Afghan migrants. Earlier in April, journalists in Afghanistan once again denounced the lack of access to information under the Taliban regime in the country and said that it results in their loss of timely coverage. They also said that the de-facto authorities are not cooperating with them in any manner. Lack of access to information has been one of the main challenges for journalists in Afghanistan since the Taliban took control of the country in August 2021. The ever-increasing restrictions against media in Afghanistan have also drawn widespread criticism globally with the United Nations (UN) and the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) decrying the arrests, demanding the Taliban stop harassing local journalists and stifling freedom of speech through continued detentions and threats. Since the Taliban took over Afghanistan in mid-August last year, it rolled back women’s rights advances and media freedom revoking the efforts on gender equality and freedom of speech in the country. \n \n \n \n \n \n Earlier, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said that journalists and media workers should have immunity and the crimes committed against them should be investigated.  \n (With inputs from agencies)",

Canadian Immigration Minister Marc Miller announced a new temporary visa program, giving them a potential path to a safe haven in Canada. However, the offer comes with a stark caveat: escaping Gaza’s tight restrictions remains a hurdle the Canadian government can’t guarantee they’ll overcome. Despite the uncertainty, families separated by walls and conflict can now apply for short-term visas if they meet the eligibility criteria.

The real number was undoubtedly higher since some people were hesitant to come forward, he added. The number of reported antisemitic hate crimes in this period almost trebled to 38 from 13 last year, while those involving the Muslim, Palestinian, and Arab populations leapt to 17 from just one in 2022. \n             \n            \n “The impact of the events in the Middle East on our city is ongoing and has escalated since Oct. 7,” Demkiw told a televised news conference.  \n Since the Oct. 7 Hamas raid into southern Israel and subsequent Israeli retaliation, 25 people have been arrested and 64 charges laid in relation to reported hate incidents.  \n “(Hate crimes) can traumatize not just victims, but all members of the targeted community and beyond,” said Demkiw. Toronto has temporarily boosted the size of its hate crime unit to 29 from the usual six. With around three million people living in Toronto, it is by far the biggest city in  Canada , which has a population of just over 40 million.  \n (With inputs from agencies)",

        "text": "A participant chants slogans for the freedom of Gaza during a demonstration under the slogan \"Germany-wide solidarity with Palestine\" in Berlin, Germany, Saturday Dec. 23, 2023. (Christoph Soeder/dpa via AP)   \n         RAFAH, Gaza Strip:  More than 90 Palestinians, including dozens from an extended family, were killed in Israeli airstrikes on two homes, rescuers and hospital officials said Saturday, a day after the U.N. chief warned again that nowhere is safe in Gaza and that Israel’s offensive is creating “massive obstacles” to distribution of humanitarian aid.  \n             Also Saturday, the Israeli military said troops arrested hundreds of alleged militants in Gaza over the past week and transferred more than 200 of them to Israel for further interrogation, providing rare details on a controversial policy of mass roundups of Palestinian men. The army said more than 700 people with alleged ties to the militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad have so far been sent to Israeli lockups. Israel declared war after Hamas gunmen stormed across the border on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking some 240 hostages. More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s war to destroy Hamas and more than 53,000 have been wounded, according to health officials in Gaza, a besieged territory ruled by the Islamic militant group for the past 16 years. Despite mounting international calls for a cease-fire, Israel has vowed to keep up the fight until Hamas is destroyed and removed from power in Gaza and all the hostages are freed. The Biden administration has shielded Israel in the diplomatic arena. On Friday, the U.N. Security Council adopted a watered-down resolution that calls for immediately speeding up aid deliveries to desperate civilians in Gaza, but not for a cease-fire. \n             \n           The Health Ministry in Gaza on Saturday evening said 201 people had been killed over the past 24 hours. On Friday, airstrikes flattened two homes, one in Gaza City and the other in the urban refugee camp of Nuseirat in the center of the territory. The Gaza City strike killed 76 people from the al-Mughrabi family, making it one of the deadliest of the war, said Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesman for Gaza’s Civil Defense department. He provided the names of 16 heads of households within the family, and said the dead included women and children. Among those killed were Issam al-Mughrabi, a veteran employee of the U.N. Development Program, his wife, and their five children. “The loss of Issam and his family has deeply affected us all. The U.N. and civilians in Gaza are not a target,” said Achim Steiner, the head of the agency. “This war must end.” Later Friday, a strike pulverized the Nuseirat home of Mohammed Khalifa, a local TV journalist, killing him and at least 14 others, according to officials at the nearby Al Aqsa Martyrs’ Hospital where the bodies were taken. Mourners held funeral prayers Saturday in the hospital’s courtyard while rescue teams continued to search for survivors. The legs of at least two bodies were seen under what appeared to be a collapsed roof. Israel blames Hamas for the high civilian death toll, citing the militants’ use of crowded residential areas and tunnels. Israel has launched thousands of airstrikes since Oct. 7, and has largely refrained from commenting on specific attacks. Israel’s offensive has been one of the most devastating military campaigns in recent history, displacing nearly 85% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people and leveling wide swaths of the tiny coastal enclave. More than half a million people in Gaza — a quarter of the population — are starving, according to a report this week from the United Nations and other agencies. The military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said late Friday that forces are widening the ground offensive “to additional areas of the strip, with a focus on the south.” He said operations were also continuing in the northern half of Gaza, the initial focus of Israel’s ground offensive. The army said that it carried out airstrikes against Hamas fighters in several locations of Gaza City. The army statement on detentions followed earlier Palestinian reports of large-scale roundups of teenage boys and men from homes, shelters and hospitals in northern Gaza where ground troops have established firmer control. Some of the released detainees have said they were stripped to their underwear, beaten and held for days with minimal water. Hamas called on the International Committee of the Red Cross and other global organizations to put pressure on Israeli authorities to reveal the whereabouts and conditions of hundreds of people in Gaza who were detained. Israel’s military has denied abuse allegations and said those without links to militants were quickly released. Israel says it has killed thousands of Hamas militants, including about 2,000 in the past three weeks, but has not presented evidence. It says 139 of its soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive. Following the U.N. resolution, it was not immediately clear how and when aid deliveries would accelerate. Currently, trucks enter through two crossings — Rafah on the border with Egypt and Kerem Shalom on the border with Israel. On Friday, fewer than 100 trucks entered the crossings, the U.N. said — far below the daily average of 500 before the war. Both crossings were closed Saturday by mutual agreement among Israel, Egypt and the U.N., Israeli officials said. Ahead of the Security Council vote, the U.S. negotiated the removal of language that would have given the U.N. authority to inspect aid going into Gaza, something Israel says it must continue to do itself to ensure material does not reach Hamas. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Friday that it’s a mistake to measure the effectiveness of the humanitarian operation by the number of trucks. “The real problem is that the way Israel is conducting this offensive is creating massive obstacles to the distribution of humanitarian aid inside Gaza,” he said. He said the prerequisites for an effective aid operation don’t exist: security, staff who can work in safety, logistical capacity and the resumption of commercial activity. Guterres said “much more is needed immediately” to end the “nightmare” for people in Gaza. (Magdy reported from Cairo. Associated Press writer Edith M.

The ‘attack’ caused a fire on the Japanese-owned vessel, which was extinguished, and no casualties were reported. The American military “remains in communication with the vessel as it continues toward a destination in India,” the Pentagon said in a statement. “The motor vessel CHEM PLUTO, a Liberia-flagged, Japanese-owned, and Netherlands-operated chemical tanker was struck at approximately 10 a.m. local time (6 a.m. GMT) today in the Indian Ocean, 200 nautical miles from the coast of India, by a one-way attack drone fired from Iran,” Reuters quoted a Pentagon spokesperson as saying.  \n             Drone ‘Attack’ On CHEM PLUTO According to the statement, the Chem Pluto ship was operated by a Dutch entity and flew under a Liberian flag. The drone strike on the vessel happened 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers) off the coast of India. \nNotably, there was immediate claim of the ‘attack’ that occurred amid drone and missile attacks by Yemen’s Iran-backed Huthi rebels on a vital shipping lane in the Red Sea. The Huthis stated that they are holding the missile attacks in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Indian Navy Responded The Indian navy one the other hand stated that it had responded to a request for assistance. \n“An aircraft was dispatched and it reached overhead the vessel and established safety of the involved ship and its crew. An Indian navy warship has also been dispatched so as to provide assistance as required,” AFP quoted a navy official as saying. \nEscalating Regional Tensions And New Risk To Shipping Lanes The drone attack highlights escalating regional tensions and new risk to shipping lanes amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas. \n             \n           The Iranian government has criticized Israel’s military operation in Gaza, in which thousands of Palestinians were killed. \nAs per the Pentagon statement, it was the “seventh Iranian attack on commercial shipping since 2021.”",

        "description": "A group of local students unfurled a massive Palestinian flag as they stood in silence.",
        "text": "A nativity scene decorated to honor the victims in Gaza is displayed in Manger Square, near the Nativity Church, which is traditionally believed to be the birthplace of Jesus, on Christmas Eve, in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, Sunday, Dec. 24, 2023. (AP Photo/Mahmoud Illean)   \n         BETHLEHEM, West Bank:  The normally bustling biblical birthplace of Jesus resembled a ghost town on Sunday, as Christmas Eve celebrations in Bethlehem were called off due to the Israel-Hamas war.  \n             The festive lights and Christmas tree that normally decorate Manger Square were missing, as were the throngs of foreign tourists and jubilant youth marching bands that gather in the West Bank town each year to mark the holiday. Dozens of Palestinian security forces patrolled the empty square. “This year, without the Christmas tree and without lights, there’s just darkness,” said Brother John Vinh, a Franciscan monk from Vietnam who has lived in Jerusalem for six years. He said he always comes to Bethlehem to mark Christmas, but this year was especially sobering, as he gazed at a nativity scene in Manger Square with a baby Jesus wrapped in a white shroud, reminiscent of the thousands of children killed in the fighting in Gaza. Barbed wire surrounded the scene, the grey rubble reflecting none of the joyous lights and bursts of color that normally fill the square during the Christmas season. \n             \n           The cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town’s economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem’s income — almost all of that during the Christmas season. With many major airlines canceling flights to Israel, few foreigners are visiting. Local officials say over 70 hotels in Bethlehem have been forced to close, leaving thousands of people unemployed. Gift shops were slow to open on Christmas Eve, although a few did once the rain had stopped pouring down. There were few visitors, however. “We can’t justify putting out a tree and celebrating as normal, when some people (in Gaza) don’t even have houses to go to,” said Ala’a Salameh, one of the owners of Afteem Restaurant, a family-owned falafel restaurant just steps from the square. Salameh said Christmas Eve is usually the busiest day of the year. “Normally, you can’t find a single chair to sit, we’re full from morning till midnight,” said Salameh. This year, just one table was taken, by journalists taking a break from the rain. Under a banner that read “Bethlehem’s Christmas bells ring for a cease-fire in Gaza,” a few teenagers offered small inflatable Santas, but no one was buying. Instead of their traditional musical march through the streets of Bethlehem, young scouts stood silently with flags. A group of local students unfurled a massive Palestinian flag as they stood in silence. “Our message every year on Christmas is one of peace and love, but this year it’s a message of sadness, grief and anger in front of the international community with what is happening and going on in the Gaza Strip,” Bethlehem’s mayor, Hana Haniyeh, said in an address to the crowd. Over 20,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 50,000 wounded during Israel’s air and ground offensive against Gaza’s Hamas rulers, according to health officials there, while some 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The war was triggered by Hamas’ deadly assault Oct. 7 on southern Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 hostages. The Gaza war has been accompanied by a surge in violence, with some 300 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire. The fighting has affected life across the West Bank. Since Oct. 7, access to Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the Israeli-occupied territory has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass military checkpoints. The restrictions have also prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians from exiting the territory to work in Israel. Amir Michael Giacaman opened his store, “Il Bambino,” which sells olive wood carvings and other souvenirs, for the first time since Oct. 7. There have been no tourists, and few local residents have money to spare because those who worked in Israel have been stuck at home. “When people have extra money, they go buy food,” said his wife, Safa Giacaman. “This year, we’re telling the Christmas story. We’re celebrating Jesus, not the tree, not Santa Claus, she said, as their daughter Makaella ran around the deserted store.",

        "title": "A Weekend Of Combat In Gaza Kills 15 Israeli Soldiers As Public Support For The War Is Tested",
        "description": "As Christmas Eve fell, smoke still rose over Gaza from the fighting, while Bethlehem in the West Bank was hushed, its holiday celebrations called off.",
        "text": "An Israeli Apache helicopter fires flares over the Gaza Strip, as seen from southern Israel, Sunday, Dec. 24, 2023. (AP Photo/Ariel Schalit)   \n         DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza:  Fifteen Israeli soldiers have been killed in combat in Gaza over the weekend, the Israeli military said Sunday, while tentative efforts continued on a deal for another exchange of hostages for Palestinians held by Israel.  \n             As Christmas Eve fell, smoke still rose over Gaza from the fighting, while Bethlehem in the West Bank was hushed, its holiday celebrations called off. The mounting death toll among Israeli troops — 154 since the ground offensive began — could erode public support for the war, which was sparked when Hamas-led militants stormed communities in southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 and taking 240 hostage. The war has devastated parts of Gaza, killed roughly 20,400 Palestinians and displaced almost all of the besieged territory’s 2.3 million people. The Health Ministry in Gaza said 166 people were killed in the coastal enclave over the past day. \n             \n           Israelis still largely stand behind the country’s stated goals of crushing Hamas’ governing and military capabilities and releasing the remaining 129 captives. That’s despite rising international pressure against Israel’s offensive, and the soaring death toll and unprecedented suffering among Palestinians. HAMAS EXACTS A PRICE “The war exacts a very heavy price from us, but we have no choice but to continue fighting,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. There has been widespread anger against his government, which many criticize for failing to protect civilians on Oct. 7 and promoting policies that allowed Hamas to gain strength over the years. Netanyahu has avoided accepting responsibility for the military and policy failures. “Over time, the public will find it hard to ignore the heavy price paid, as well as the suspicion that the aims that were loudly heralded are still far from being attained, and that Hamas is showing no signs of capitulating in the near future,” wrote Amos Harel, military affairs commentator for the Haaretz newspaper. On Sunday, the Israeli military said it had completed the dismantling of Hamas’ underground headquarters in northern Gaza, part of an operation to take down the vast tunnel network and kill off top commanders that Israeli leaders have said could take months. Efforts toward negotiations continued. On Sunday, the head of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Ziyad al-Nakhalah, arrived in Egypt for talks. The militant group, which also took part in the Oct. 7 attack, said it was prepared to consider releasing hostages only after fighting ends. Hamas’ top leader Ismail Haniyeh traveled to Cairo for talks days earlier. INSIDE GAZA Israel’s offensive has been one of the most devastating military campaigns in recent history. More than two-thirds of the 20,000 Palestinians killed have been women and children, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. The Palestinian Red Crescent said a 13-year-old boy was shot and killed in an Israeli drone attack while inside al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis, a part of Gaza where Israel’s military believes Hamas leaders are hiding. An Israeli strike overnight hit a house in a refugee camp west of the city of Rafah, on Gaza’s border with Egypt. At least two men were killed, according to Associated Press journalists in the hospital where the bodies were taken. At least two people were killed and six others wounded when a missile stuck a building in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. And Palestinians reported heavy Israeli bombardment and gunfire in Jabaliya, an area north of Gaza City that Israel had claimed to control. Hamas’ military arm said its fighters shelled Israeli troops in Jabaliya and Jabaliya refugee camp. “Sounds of explosions and gunfire never stopped,” said Jabaliya resident Assad Radwan. Israel has come under international criticism for the civilian death toll but it blames Hamas, citing the militants’ use of crowded residential areas and tunnels. Israel has launched thousands of airstrikes since Oct. 7, and has largely refrained from commenting on specific attacks. Israel also faces allegations of mistreating Palestinian men and teenage boys detained in homes, shelters, hospitals and elsewhere during the offensive. It has denied abuse allegations and said those without links to militants are quickly released. Speaking to the AP from a hospital bed in Rafah after his release, Khamis al-Burdainy of Gaza City said Israeli forces detained him after tanks and bulldozers partly destroyed his home. He said men were handcuffed and blindfolded. “We didn’t sleep. We didn’t get food and water,” he said, crying and covering his face. Another released detainee, Mohammed Salem, from the Gaza City neighborhood of Shijaiyah, said Israeli troops beat them. “We were humiliated,” he said. “A female soldier would come and beat an old man, aged 72 years old.” Israel says it has killed thousands of Hamas militants, without presenting evidence. INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE The United Nations Security Council has passed a watered-down resolution calling for the speedy delivery of humanitarian aid for hungry and desperate Palestinians and the release of all the hostages, but not for a cease-fire. But it was not immediately clear how and when deliveries of food, medical supplies and other aid, far below the daily average of 500 before the war, would accelerate. Trucks enter through two crossings — Rafah, and Kerem Shalom on the border with Israel. Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Palestinian Crossings Authority, said 93 aid trucks entered Gaza through Rafah on Saturday. The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, reiterated U.N. calls for a humanitarian cease-fire, adding on social media that “the decimation of the Gaza health system is a tragedy.” Amid concerns about a wider regional conflict, U.S. Central Command reported that a patrol ship in the Red Sea on Saturday shot down four drones launched from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, a while two Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles were fired into international shipping lanes, and a drone struck an Indian-flagged crude oil tanker, the Saibaba, causing no injuries. The Iran-backed Houthis say their attacks are aimed at Israel-linked ships in an effort to stop the Israeli offensive in Gaza. A Houthi spokesman, Mohammed Abdul-Salam, said a U.S. warship fired at a drone in the Red Sea. (Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "text": "Families of hostages taken by Gaza operatives booed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday (local time) as he addressed parliament, vowing to bring the captives home but saying “more time” was needed. “We don’t have time,” one relative called out in response from the Knesset gallery, after which the families chanted “Now! Now! Now!” demanding the immediate release of the hostages.  \n             During a special parliamentary session attended by families of the hostages, the Israeli PM said, “We won’t stop fighting,” adding that “we need time.”  Netanyahu said he reached out to Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin to intervene on the hostages’ behalf and that his wife Sara had directly appealed to the Pope, according to The Times of Israel report. “I am also not detailing the efforts we are making at this moment and I do not think it is right to detail them,” Netanyahu continued. “I just want to emphasize: We will shake every tree and turn over every stone to return all our abductees.” Israel said 129 hostages, kidnapped on October 7 when Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel, are still held in the Palestinian territory. “We, my colleagues and I, aren’t sparing any effort,” Netanyahu added, to return “all of our hostages home”. \n             \n           “We’re not stopping, we’re continuing to fight and we’re intensifying the fighting in the coming days.

In the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, troops of the Nahal Brigade raided two schools in Gaza City’s Daraj and Tuffah neighbourhoods, CNN reported. The IDF said raids were carried out following intelligence of Hamas operatives hiding at the complexes. Hamas’s Daraj-Tuffah battalion is believed by the IDF to be the last standing battalion in northern Gaza. According to IDF, the troops during the raids encountered and killed several Hamas gunmen. Dozens of explosive devices, assault rifles, and 15 explosive belts were found in the complexes. In one incident, a Hamas terrorist fired a missile from one of the schools at the troops.",

In response, they have issued a travel advisory for Israeli citizens in India, urging them to avoid crowded places and places serving Westerners/Jews and Israelis.",
        "text": "New Delhi: Police and other officials near the Embassy of Israel after Delhi Police received a call about a blast near the embassy, in New Delhi district, Tuesday evening, Dec. 26, 2023. (PTI Photo/Arun Sharma)   \n         New Delhi:  The Israeli National Security Council has issued a travel advisory for its citizens in India, suspecting that an explosion near the Israeli embassy in New Delhi on Tuesday was “a possible terror attack”. No one was injured in the blast that occurred near the Israel embassy in the Chanakyapuri diplomatic enclave in New Delhi on Tuesday evening. Security agencies in Delhi were sent into a tizzy after receiving an emergency call reporting an ‘explosion’ near the Israel Embassy in Chanakyapuri. After an extensive search operation, reports confirmed to have found potential evidentiary exhibits, including a typed letter addressed to the Israeli Ambassador to India.  \n             According to the eyewitness, the explosion occurred on an empty plot of land situated in front of the Central Training Hindi Institute and behind the Israel Embassy. Israeli embassy spokesperson Guy Nir said, “We can confirm that around 5:48 pm, there was a blast in close proximity to the embassy. Delhi Police and the security team are still investigating the situation.” Advisory for Israeli nationals in India \n Israeli nationals have been warned to try to avoid going to crowded places (malls and markets) and places identified as serving Westerners/Jews and Israelis. \n They have also been urged to be on heightened alert in public places (including restaurants, hotels, pubs, etc). \n The recommendations also suggest avoiding openly displaying Israeli symbols, refraining from attending unsecured large-scale events, and avoiding publicising itineraries on social media as well as photographs and details of visits in real-time. \n The Israeli Foreign Ministry, in a press statement earlier on Tuesday, said that there were no casualties in the explosion. “The incident is under investigation by the local authorities in full cooperation with the Israeli security forces”, the ministry said. Soon after the explosion, which took place in a green belt area outside the Central Hindi Training Institute located near the embassy, teams of Delhi Police’s Special Cell, bomb disposal squad and fire department rushed to the spot. An almost three-hour-long search operation was carried out in the area. \n             \n           A National Investigation Agency (NIA) team also examined the site, a senior police officer in New Delhi said. After the incident, security was further beefed up around the embassy and other Israeli establishments, according to officials. Meanwhile, the police have reinforced security measures around the Chabad House in Paharganj where a large number of Israelis reside. Earlier this month, the NSC warned Israelis to reconsider all their travel abroad and called on those who do need to travel overseas to avoid outward displays of their Jewish and Israeli identities amid rising antisemitism around the world amidst the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas militant group in Gaza. In the past, too, the Israeli embassy and its staff have come under attack in New Delhi. There was an explosion outside the Israeli embassy in 2021 in which cars were damaged, but no casualties were reported. In February 2012, the wife of an Israeli security staff at the embassy was injured in an attack on her car in New Delhi. Security has been high around the Israel embassy in New Delhi since the war between Israel and Hamas began earlier this year, security officials said.",

        "title": "Gaza War To Last Months, Israel Says, As Fears Of Conflict Spread Rise",
        "description": "Israel's Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi told reporters in a televised statement on Tuesday from the Gaza border that the war would go on \"for many months\".",
        "text": "The strike took place as the US has been preparing retaliation operations against Iran-backed terrorists who conducted a drone attack on a US base in Jordan last month.   \n         CAIRO/GAZA/JERUSALEM:  Israel’s war on Hamas will last months, Israel’s military chief said, as a string of incidents outside the Gaza Strip highlighted the risk of the conflict spreading.  \n             Israel’s Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi told reporters in a televised statement on Tuesday from the Gaza border that the war would go on “for many months”. “There are no magic solutions, there are no shortcuts in dismantling a terrorist organization, only determined and persistent fighting,” Halevi said. “We will reach Hamas’ leadership too, whether it takes a week or if it takes months.” Israeli actions intensified around Christmas, particularly in a central area just south of the seasonal waterway that bisects the Gaza Strip. The Israeli army told civilians to leave the area, though many said there was no safe place left to go. \n             \n           “We are gravely concerned about the continued bombardment of Middle Gaza by Israeli forces, which has claimed more than 100 Palestinian lives since Christmas Eve,” said U.N. Human Rights Office spokesperson Seif Magango on Tuesday. “Israeli forces must take all measures available to protect civilians. Warnings and evacuation orders do not absolve them of the full range of their international humanitarian law obligations.” Israel is determined to destroy Hamas despite global calls for a ceasefire in the 11-week-old war. Since Hamas killed 1,200 people and captured 240 hostages on Oct. 7 in the deadliest day in Israeli history, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has responded with an assault that has laid much of Hamas-ruled Gaza to waste. Palestinian health authorities say nearly 21,000 people have been killed in Israeli strikes, with thousands more feared buried under rubble. Nearly all the enclave’s 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes, many several times. Gaza authorities buried 80 unidentified Palestinians on Tuesday whose bodies were handed over by Israel through the Kerem Shalom border crossing, the health ministry said. According to the Islamic Waqf, or religious affairs ministry, the bodies were collected from the northern part of the Gaza Strip. They were buried in a long ditch at a Rafah cemetery in the south. “Pictures are being taken to identify them later,” a representative of the Gaza Islamic Waqf said during the burials. Israel says it is doing what it can to protect civilians, and blames Hamas for putting them in harm’s way by operating among them, which Hamas denies. But even Israel’s closest ally the United States has said it should do more to reduce civilian deaths from what President Joe Biden has called “indiscriminate bombing”. SPREAD THREAT There are growing signs the conflict is starting to spread. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi militia claimed responsibility for a missile attack on Tuesday on a container ship in the Red Sea and for an attempt to attack Israel with drones. The Houthis have been attacking ships they say have links to Israel in the entrance to the Red Sea, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. The attacks are a response to Israel’s assault on Gaza, the militia says. An Israeli airstrike killed a senior leader of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards in Syria on Monday. And on the Lebanon border on Tuesday, Israel said Hezbollah fired anti-tank missiles at a church, wounding nine Israeli soldiers and a civilian, after which it fired rockets from near a mosque, drawing retaliatory airstrikes. In India, meanwhile, there was an explosion near the Israeli embassy in New Delhi. Authorities said no staff were hurt. “We are in a multi-front war and are coming under attack from seven theatres: Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Judea and Samaria (the West Bank), Iraq, Yemen and Iran,” Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told lawmakers on Tuesday, listing six places where Iran-backed militants are active, as well as Iran itself. “We have already responded and taken action in six of these theatres,” he said, without specifying the one that had yet to see Israeli action. Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer was meeting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan in Washington on Tuesday for talks on the war and the return of hostages, the White House said. The United States has openly pressed Israel in recent weeks to scale down its war to a more targeted operation of raids on Hamas leaders. But Washington is still seen in the region as a supporter of Israel and U.S. forces have been attacked by Iran-backed militants in the Middle East. The U.S. military carried out retaliatory airstrikes on Kataib Hezbollah militants in Iraq on Monday after a drone attack on a U.S. base in Erbil left one U.S. service member in critical condition and wounded two.",

        "text": "It is worth noting that 21 annual summits have taken place alternatively in India and Russia. (Images: X/@DrSJaishankar)   \n         Vladimir Putin And Narendra Modi:  Amid the ongoing war with Ukraine and indirect involvement with the crisis in the Middle East, viz Israel-Hamas war, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit Russia next year, saying it will allow them to discuss all current issues and talk about the outlook for the development of bilateral relations. This development took place when India’s External Affairs Minister (EAM) S Jaishankar on Wednesday held a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow at the Kremlin with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Indian Ambassador to Russia Pavan Kapoor in attendance.  \n             Earlier in the day, Jaishankar met Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov and held discussions on a wide range of global issues Indo-Pacific, the Ukraine conflict, and the Gaza issue. “We will be glad to see our friend, Mr Prime Minister Modi in Russia. We will be able to discuss all current issues, talk about the outlook for the development of Russian-Indian relations. We have a very large amount of work to do,” said President Putin as reported by the state-run Tass news agency. President Putin asked EAM Jaishankar to pass on to PM Modi “his best wishes” and an invitation to come to Russia with a subtle hint that the Prime Minister will be occupied with the upcoming parliamentary elections tentatively scheduled to be held in March-April next year as President Putin said that he “realised India will be busy with internal affairs next year as the country is poised to hold elections to select a new government”. \n             \n           EAM Jaishankar is in Russia on a five-day official visit. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow that the EAM had already met with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. “India is an important partner of Russia, so the ministers will talk about the contacts held and the course of their discussion,” reported the Kremlin spokesman. While addressing the joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Jaishankar appreciated the India-Russia trade, which is at an all-time high. He said that the negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement between India and the Eurasian Economic Union will resume in January next year. “It’s always good to be in Moscow. So, I agree with you that our relationship has been very strong, very steady, and I think we have lived up to the responsibilities of a special and privileged strategic partnership,” Jaishankar told Lavrov. The External Affairs Minister said that the relationship between New Delhi and Moscow remains very steady and strong and is based on strategic convergence on geopolitical interests. Jaishankar On Tuesday held a “comprehensive and productive” meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Manturov on the bilateral economic cooperation during which they witnessed the signing of some “very important” agreements related to the construction of the future power-generating units of the Kudankulam nuclear power plant in Tamil Nadu. It is worth noting that 21 annual summits have taken place alternatively in India and Russia. The last summit took place in New Delhi in December 2021. Putin also said that the trade turnover between Russia and India is growing, particularly on account of crude oil and high technology areas, Tass reported. “Our trade turnover is growing, for the second year in a row at the same time and at a steady pace. The growth rate this year is even higher than in the last year,” he said. As soon as the meeting started, the Russian president told Jaishankar that they will discuss the conflict in Ukraine. “We know Prime Minister Modi’s position and we have repeatedly spoken about this — the position concerning his attitude to complex processes, including hotspots, to the situation in Ukraine,” Putin said. “I have repeatedly informed him about the situation around this conflict. I know about his desire to do everything to resolve this problem peacefully, but we will now talk more about it. We will provide you with additional information about this situation.” The ties between India and Russia remained strong notwithstanding Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. India has not yet condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and it has been maintaining that the crisis must be resolved through diplomacy and dialogue. India’s import of Russian crude oil has gone up significantly despite increasing disquiet over it in many Western countries. The two leaders also discussed progress in economic cooperation, connectivity efforts, military-technical cooperation and people-to-people exchange. Jaishankar noted that ties between India and Russia reflect geopolitical realities, strategic convergence and mutual benefit. In a post shared on X, Jaishankar stated, “A wide ranging and useful meeting with FM Sergey Lavrov of Russia. As strategic partners, discussed the international situation and contemporary issues. Exchanged views on Indo-Pacific, the Ukraine conflict, the Gaza situation , Afghanistan and Central Asia, BRICS, SCO, G20 and the UN.

Jaishankar (@DrSJaishankar)  December 27, 2023 Speaking on bilateral cooperation, Jaishankar appreciated the fact that the India-Russia trade is at an all-time high and crossed 50 billion USD last year. “What is important is that this trade is more balanced, sustainable, and provides for more market access,” he said. Meanwhile, Sergey Lavrov expressed Russia’s willingness to support India’s initiative to produce military products as part of ‘Made In India’ program. Lavrov said he and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar during the meeting took a number of steps that will expand cooperation between India and Russia, including the launch of the North-South International Transport Corridor as well as establishment of the Chennai Vladivostok route.

        "description": "A United Nations (UN) report has outlined the rapidly deteriorating human rights situation in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, following Hamas attacks. The report also calls on Israel to end unlawful killings against the Palestinian population.",
        "text": "'Rapidly Deteriorating': UN Report Raises Alarm Over Human Rights Situation In West Bank   \n         Geneva:  A recent report by the United Nationals (UN) has highlighted the rapidly worsening human rights situation in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, after the Hamas attack. It calls on Israel to cease unlawful killings and settler violence against the Palestinian population. The report suggested an immediate end to military weapons during law enforcement operations, ill-treatment of Palestinians, an end to arbitrary detention, and the lifting of discriminatory movement restrictions.  \n             The Office of Human Rights in the UN has confirmed the deaths of as many as 300 Palestinians during the time frame of October 7 to December 27, which includes 79 children in the occupied West Bank, since the continuous attacks by Hamas militants and other groups in southern Israel. Of these, 291 Palestinians were killed by Israel Defense Forces, 8 were killed by settlers and one Palestinian was killed either by IDF or settlers. Notably, before Hamas’s massive intrusion into Israel on October 7, 200 Palestinians had already been killed in the area in 2023. This is the highest number in ten-month period since 2005, the timeframe from when the UN initiated keeping records. “The use of military tactics and weapons in law enforcement contexts, the use of unnecessary or disproportionate force, and the enforcement of broad, arbitrary and discriminatory movement restrictions that affect Palestinians are extremely troubling,” ANI quoted UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk, who reacted to the report released on Thursday. \n             \n           “The violations documented in this report repeat the pattern and nature of violations reported in the past in the context of the long-standing Israeli occupation of the West Bank. However, the intensity of the violence and repression is something that has not been seen in years,” he added. “I call on Israel to take immediate, clear and effective steps to put an end to settler violence against the Palestinian population, to investigate all incidents of violence by settlers and Israeli Security Forces, to ensure effective protection of Palestinian communities against any form of forcible transfer, and to ensure the ability to herd communities displaced due to repeated attacks by armed settlers to return to their lands.” The UN report that documented the human rights situation from October 7 to November 20, mentioned a major surge in airstrikes as well as in incursions by armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers that were sent to densely populated areas and refugee camps in the West Bank. This move resulted in deaths and extensive damage to civilian infrastructure. These incursions have resulted in the deaths of at least 105 Palestinians, including 23 children. \nIt is worth noting that the IDF has arrested over 4,700 Palestinians, that includes 40 journalists, in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The report says that some of them were stripped naked, restrained for long hours with handcuffs, and had their legs tied while Israeli soldiers stepped on their heads and backs. They were slammed against walls, insulted, and humiliated, and in some cases they were subjected to sexual and gender-based violence. “The dehumanisation of Palestinians that characterises many of the settlers’ actions is very disturbing and must cease immediately. Israeli authorities should strongly censure and prevent settler violence and prosecute both its instigators and perpetrators,” said the UN Human Rights Chief. Since the Hamas attack on October 7, the Israeli government has imposed severe restrictions on the movement of Palestinians across the West Bank, the report said. The forces have shut almost all routes toward Palestinian villages and towns and disconnected Palestinian cities from main roads by blocking roads. “The report reiterates our calls for a halt to measures that lead to the creation of a coercive environment and concerns regarding forcible transfer, in addition to the continued lack of accountability for settler and ISF violence,” said Turk. \nCiting the alarming situation, the High Commissioner has requested that Israel grant the UN Human Rights Office access to the country.",

        "description": "The Pentagon says the force is a defensive coalition of more than 20 nations to ensure billions of dollars' worth of commerce can flow freely through a vital shipping chokepoint in Red Sea waters off Yemen.",
        "text": "US Allies Reluctant On Red Sea Task Force, Only 12 Of 20 Countries Willing To Join   \n         Washington:  US President Joe Biden hoped to present a firm international response to Yemen’s Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping by launching a new maritime force, but a week after its launch many allies don’t want to be associated with it, publicly, or at all. Two of America’s European allies who were listed as contributors to Operation Prosperity Guardian, Italy and Spain, issued statements appearing to distance themselves from the maritime force. The Pentagon says the force is a defensive coalition of more than 20 nations to ensure billions of dollars’ worth of commerce can flow freely through a vital shipping chokepoint in Red Sea waters off Yemen.  \n             But nearly half of those countries have so far not come forward to acknowledge their contributions or allowed the US to do so. Those contributions can range from dispatching warships to merely sending a staff officer. The reluctance of some US allies to link themselves to the effort partly reflects the fissures created by the conflict in Gaza, which has seen Biden maintain firm support for Israel even as international criticism rises over its offensive, which Gaza’s health ministry says has killed more than 21,000 Palestinians. “European governments are very worried that part of their potential electorate will turn against them,” said David Hernandez, a professor of international relations at the Complutense University of Madrid, noting that the European public is increasingly critical of Israel and wary of being drawn into a conflict. The Iran-backed Houthis have attacked or seized a dozen ships with missiles and drones since November 19, trying to inflict an international cost over Israel’s campaign, which followed the October 7 rampage in southern Israel by Hamas militants that killed 1,200 people and took 240 hostage.The navies of the United States, Britain and France have each shot down Houthi-launched drones or missiles.A person familiar with Biden administration thinking said the US believes escalating Houthi attacks call for an international response separate from the conflict raging in Gaza. The Rea Sea is the entry point for ships using the Suez Canal, which handles about 12 per cent of worldwide trade and is vital for the movement of goods between Asia and Europe. Houthi attacks have seen some ships rerouted around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, substantially increasing sailing time and costs.Denmark’s giant container firm Maersk said on Saturday it would resume shipping operations in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. But Germany’s Hapag Lloyd said on Wednesday it still believes the Red Sea is too dangerous and will continue to send ships around the Cape of Good Hope. \n             \n           Discord over Gaza While the US says 20 countries have signed up for its maritime task force, it has announced the names of only 12. “We’ll allow other countries, defer to them to talk about their participation,” US Major General Patrick Ryder told reporters last week.The EU has signaled its support of the maritime task force with a joint statement condemning the Houthi attacks.Although Britain, Greece and others have publicly embraced the US operation, several mentioned in the US announcement were quick to say they are not directly involved. Italy’s defense ministry said that it would send a ship to the Red Sea following requests from Italian ship owners and not as part of the US operation. France said it supports efforts to secure freedom of navigation in the Red Sea but that its ships would remain under French command. Spain has said it will not join Operation Prosperity Guardian and opposes using an existing EU anti-piracy mission, Atalanta, to protect Red Sea shipping. But on Wednesday, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he was willing to consider the creation of a different mission to tackle the problem. Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates earlier proclaimed no interest in the venture. Public anger over Israel’s Gaza offensive helps explain some of the reluctance of political leaders. A recent Yougov poll found that strong majorities of Western Europeans, particularly Spain and Italy, think Israel should stop military action in Gaza. There is also the risk that participating countries become subject to Houthi retaliation. The person familiar with the US administration’s thinking says that it is this risk, rather disagreements over Gaza, driving some countries to steer clear of the effort.That appears to be the case for India, which is unlikely to join the U.S. operation, according to a senior Indian military official. An Indian government official said the government worries that aligning itself with the US could make it more of a target. International support needed In reality, many European and Gulf countries already participate in one of several US-led military groups in the Middle East, including the 39-nation Combined Maritime Forces (CMF).The EU’s Atalanta operation already cooperates in a “reciprocal relationship” with CMF, according to a spokesperson for the group.That means that some countries not formally joining the Red Sea maritime task force could still coordinate patrols with the US Navy.For example, while Italy, a member of Atalanta, has not said it will join Operation Prosperity Guardian, an Italian government source told Reuters that the US-led coalition is satisfied with Italy’s contribution. The source added that the decision to send a naval frigate as part of existing operations was a way to speed the deployment and did not require a new parliamentary authorization.The US effort to draw international support for its Red Sea security push comes as the United States faces pressure on multiple fronts from Iran’s military proxies in the region. Beyond the Houthis in Yemen, Iran-backed militia have been attacking US troops in Syria and Iraq. So far, the United States has carried out limited retaliatory air strikes against the militia in Iraq and Syria, but it has refrained from doing so in Yemen. Michael Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East under the Trump administration, said the Pentagon’s goal with the new maritime coalition appeared to be to make any future Houthi attacks an international issue in order to divorce it from the Israel-Hamas war. “Once the military vessels in Operation Prosperity Guardian start protecting commercial shipping and come under a direct attack, (the Houthis) will be attacking the coalition, not just the US,” Mulroy said.",

        "text": "Palestinians flee from east to west of Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, during the ongoing Israeli bombardment, Saturday, Dec. 2, 2023. (AP Photo/Fatima Shbair)   \n         Gaza:  Amid intensified war between Israel and Hamas, an emotional story surfaced in Gaza that says a pregnant woman in the war-torn city had to walk for 5 kilometres to a hospital and gave birth to quadruplets. Identified as Iman al-Masry, the woman was exhausted after giving birth to quadruplets in a hospital in southern Gaza, miles away from her home in the north of the war-torn Palestinian territory.  \n             Days after the Israel-Hamas war broke out on October 7, the young woman fled the family home in Beit Hanun on foot with her three other children seeking safety. They all together walked for five kilometres (three miles) to the Jabalia refugee camp, looking for a means of transport that would take them to Deir al-Balah further south. At that time, Iman was six months pregnant and “the distance was too long”, she told news agency AFP. “It affected my pregnancy,” added the 28-year-old mother, who gave birth by C-section on December 18 to daughters Tia and Lynn and sons Yasser and Mohammed. \n             \n           “Mohammed weighs only one kilogramme (2.2 pounds). He cannot survive,” she said of the child she left behind at a hospital in the Nuseirat refugee camp. While taking rest on a foam mattress in a schoolroom-turned-shelter for her and her extended family, Iman recounts her journey from hell. “When I left home, I had only some summer clothes for the children. I thought the war would last a week or two and that afterwards we would go back home,” she said. More than 11 weeks later, her hope of ever going back are shattered. At present, the Gaza Strip, which is home to 2.4 million people, lies in ruins from the north to the south. As per the updates from the UN, the fighting has displaced 1.9 million Palestinians internally. In the meantime, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has asked residents in many parts of central Gaza to leave immediately while its operations against Hamas continue, CNN reported. In a message posted in Arabic on X, the IDF urged residents in 15 identified blocks south of Wadi Gaza to move to shelters. The regions include the Al-Bureij refugee camp. In its message, the IDF said people in the identified blocks “must immediately move to the shelters in Deir al-Balah. A temporary tactical local suspension of military activities will be imposed for humanitarian purposes in the southern neighbourhood of Deir al-Balah from 10:00 am to 2:00 pm for provisions purposes,” CNN reported. The IDF urged people not to move along the central axis, the Salah Al-Din road, due to the fighting in the Khan Younis area of Gaza, according to CNN report. It said, “The IDF will allow the humanitarian movement of civilians through the bypass axis west of Khan Younis.”",

        "description": "On India's position on global issues like the Ukraine crisis and the Gaza war, Prime Minister Modi said he has always advocated an honest dialogue and sincere diplomacy.",
        "text": "PM Modi (Image: ANI)   \n         New Delhi:  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it clear that ‘Modi’s guarantee’ isn’t merely a gimmick to secure political victory. Instead, it symbolizes the faith and trust impoverished citizens place in him. He also responded to criticisms from the opposition regarding issues of unemployment and inflation, stressing that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) enjoys impressive appeal nationwide. PM Modi further underscored his driving force—the belief that the most disadvantaged groups in society have in him—in an interview with India Today.  \n             “Modi’s guarantee is not a formula for winning elections; Modi’s guarantee is the trust of the poor. Today, every poor person in the country knows that Modi will not back down from his duty. This trust of the poor also gives me the energy, so even if I completely exhaust myself or push myself over my limit, I would not let this trust be violated,” he said. PM Modi’s ‘Modi Ki Guarantee’ The Prime Minister had, in his election rallies in assembly polls in five states last month, talked about the “Modi ki guarantee,” saying that it is a guarantee that the promise made will be fulfilled. The BJP ousted the Congress from power in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, scored a handsome victory in Madhya Pradesh and improved its performance in Telangana. Referring to the schemes and initiatives of the government aimed at making India’s industry more competitive globally, he said infrastructure creation is happening at a never-before-seen pace, and all sectors are doing much better than what they did 10 years ago. \n             \n           “It is well known that investments in infrastructure have a large multiplier impact on growth and employment. Hence, we have constantly increased the capital investment outlay,” PM Modi said. \nHe said that the reforms should focus on improving the lives of people. “As a result of such reforms, India’s growth journey has picked up at a rapid pace,” PM Modi said, exuding confidence in India’s ability to become a 5-trillion-dollar economy. India’s G20 Presidency Speaking about the success of India’s G20 Presidency, the Prime Minister said that India was able to focus on human-centric development. “We were able to bring focus on human-centric development to the global agenda. We got the developed and developing worlds to forge consensus. We revitalised multilateralism,” the PM said. Referring to the African Union joining as a member of the G20 in New Delhi, PM Modi pointed out that India’s presidency became a platform to provide a rightful place to the Global South in shaping the global narrative. On India’s position on global issues like the Ukraine crisis and the Gaza war, the Prime Minister said he has always advocated an honest dialogue and sincere diplomacy. “I have always believed that honest dialogue and sincere diplomacy should be the preferred paths to resolving differences in an atmosphere free from fear and coercion. Be it in Ukraine or in Gaza, our approach has been guided by this belief. We cannot let terrorists or violence set the agenda,” the Prime Minister said. In the recent Supreme Court judgement on Article 370, the Prime Minister said that the people of the regions are free to shape their destinies. “With Article 370 gone forever, the people of J-K and Ladakh, for the first time, are free to shape their destinies with their own hands. The government has adopted a multi-pronged approach with a focus on security, development, investment in infrastructure and human capital and a complete re-engineering of government processes through reforms,” he said. “We are absolutely on the path of ensuring sustainable peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of the region by improving their living standards, promoting economic growth, and generating employment opportunities,” he added.

        "title": "Airstrikes Hit Camps In Central Gaza As Biden Administration Approves New Weapons Sales To Israel",
        "description": "The United States has shielded Israel diplomatically and has continued to supply weapons.",
        "text": "Palestinians look at the destruction after an Israeli strike in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, Friday, Dec. 29, 2023. (AP Photo/Fatima Shbair)   \n         DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip:  Israeli warplanes struck two urban refugee camps in central Gaza on Saturday, as the Biden administration approved a new emergency weapons sale to Israel despite persistent international cease-fire calls over mounting civilian deaths, hunger and mass displacement in the enclave.  \n             Israel says it is determined to pursue its unprecedented air and ground offensive until it has dismantled Hamas, a goal viewed by some as unattainable because of the militant group’s deep roots in Palestinian society. The United States has shielded Israel diplomatically and has continued to supply weapons. Israel argues that ending the war now would mean victory for Hamas, a stance shared by the Biden administration which at the same time urged Israel to do more to avoid harm to Palestinian civilians. The war, triggered by the deadly Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel, has displaced some 85% of the Gaza Strip’s 2.3 million residents, sending swells of people seeking shelter in Israeli-designated safe areas that the military has nevertheless also bombed. That has left Palestinians with a harrowing sense that nowhere is safe in the tiny enclave. \n             \n           Residents in the urban refugee camps of Nuseirat and Bureij, two recent hot spots of combat, reported Israeli airstrikes overnight and into Saturday. Nuseirat resident Mustafa Abu Wawee said a strike hit the home of one of his relatives, killing two people. “The (Israeli) occupation is doing everything to force people to leave,” he said over the phone while searching along with others for four people missing under the rubble. “They want to break our spirit and will but they will fail. We are here to stay.” A second strike late Friday in Nuseirat targeted the home of a journalist for Al-Quds TV, a channel linked to the group Islamic Jihad whose militants also participated in the Oct. 7 attack. The channel said the journalist, Jaber Abu Hadros and six members of his family were killed. Bureij resident Rami Abu Mosab said sounds of gunfire echoed across the camp overnight, followed by heavy airstrikes Saturday. With Israeli forces pushing deeper into Khan Younis and the camps of central Gaza, tens of thousands of Palestinians streamed into the already crowded city of Rafah at the southernmost end of Gaza in recent days. Drone footage showed a vast camp of thousands of tents and makeshift shacks set up on what had been empty land on Rafah’s western outskirts next to U.N. warehouses. People arrived in Rafah in trucks, in carts and on foot. Those who did not find space in the already overwhelmed shelters put up tents on roadsides slick with mud from winter rains. MORE U.S. WEAPONS FOR ISRAEL The State Department said Friday that Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Congress he approved a $147.5 million sale for equipment, including fuses, charges and primers, that is needed for 155 mm shells Israel bought previously. It marked the second time this month that the Biden administration is bypassing Congress to approve an emergency weapons sale to Israel. The department cited the “urgency of Israel’s defensive needs” as a reason for the approval, and argued that “it is vital to U.S. national interests to ensure Israel is able to defend itself against the threats it faces.” The emergency determination means the purchase will bypass the congressional review requirement for foreign military sales. Such determinations are rare, but not unprecedented, when administrations see an urgent need for weapons to be delivered without waiting for lawmakers’ approval. Blinken made a similar decision on Dec. 9 to approve the sale to Israel of nearly 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition worth more than $106 million. Both moves have come as President Joe Biden’s request for a nearly $106 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other national security needs remains stalled in Congress, caught up in a debate over U.S. immigration policy and border security. Some Democratic lawmakers have spoken of making the proposed $14.3 billion in American assistance to its Mideast ally contingent on concrete steps by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to reduce civilian casualties in Gaza during the war with Hamas. DISEASE AND HUNGER ARE SPREADING More than a week after a U.N. Security Council resolution called for the unhindered delivery of aid at scale across besieged Gaza, conditions have only worsened, U.N. agencies warned. Aid officials said the aid entering Gaza remains woefully inadequate. Distributing goods is hampered by long delays at two border crossings, ongoing fighting, Israeli airstrikes, repeated cuts in internet and phone services and a breakdown of law and order that makes it difficult to secure aid convoys, they said. Nearly the entire population is fully dependent on outside humanitarian aid, said Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. A quarter of the population is starving because too few trucks enter with food, medicine, fuel and other supplies — sometimes fewer than 100 trucks a day, according to U.N. daily reports. U.N. monitors said operations at the Israeli-run Kerem Shalom crossing halted for four days this week because of security incidents, such as a drone strike and the seizing of aid by desperate Gaza residents. They said the crossing reopened Friday, and that a total of 81 aid trucks entered Gaza through Kerem Shalom and the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border — a fraction of the typical prewar volume of 500 trucks a day. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization warned that the spread of disease is accelerating, particularly in southern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands have crammed into an ever-shrinking area to flee airstrikes and advancing Israeli ground forces. The agency reported more cases of upper respiratory infections, diarrhea, lice, scabies, chickenpox, skin rashes and meningitis. RISING DEATH TOLL The war has already killed over 21,500 Palestinians, most of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Its count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel holds Hamas responsible for civilian deaths and injuries, saying the militants embed themselves within civilian infrastructure. Israeli officials, meanwhile, have vowed to bring back more than 100 hostages still held by the militants after their Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel that triggered the war. The assault killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. The military says 168 of its soldiers have been killed since the ground offensive began.",

        "description": "Rain in New Zealand’s largest city Auckland is expected to ease by midnight when downtown Sky Tower, the country’s tallest structure, erupts with fireworks as the centerpiece of a spectacular annual light show.",
        "text": "Fireworks explode over the Sydney Harbour as early New Year celebrations begin in Sydney, Australia, Sunday, Dec. 31, 2023. (AP Photo/Mark Baker)   \n         New Year 2024:  Australians and New Zealanders are making final preparations on New Year’s Eve to become among the first nations to ring in 2024 as ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza cast a pall over celebrations and heightened tensions across parts of the world.  \n             Rain in New Zealand’s largest city Auckland is expected to ease by midnight when downtown Sky Tower, the country’s tallest structure, erupts with fireworks as the centerpiece of a spectacular annual light show. Two hours later in neighboring Australia, the Sydney Harbor Bridge will become the focal point of a renowned midnight fireworks display and light show viewed annually by around 425 million people worldwide, according to city authorities. More police than ever have been deployed throughout Sydney to ensure safety as more than 1 million people — equivalent to one in five of the city’s population — converge on the harbor waterfront for the best available views, state government authorities said in a statement. \n             \n           Many revelers have been camping at the best vantage points since Sunday morning. The waterfront has been the scene of heated pro-Palestinian protests after the sails of the Sydney Opera House were illuminated in the colors of the Israeli flag in response to the Oct. 7 attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas that triggered the war. In New York’s Times Square, officials and party organizers say they are prepared to welcome crowds of revelers and ensure their safety. At a security briefing Friday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said there were “no specific threats” to the annual New Year’s Eve bash, which is expected to draw tens of thousands of people to the heart of midtown Manhattan. The celebrity-filled event will include live performances from Flo Rida, Megan Thee Stallion and LL Cool J, as well as televised appearances from Cardi B and others. Organizers said in-person attendance is expected to return to pre-COVID levels, even as foot traffic around Times Square remains down slightly since the pandemic. Amid near-daily protests in New York sparked by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, police said they would expand the security perimeter around the party, creating a “buffer zone” that will allow them to head off potential demonstrations. “We will be out here with our canines, on horseback, our helicopters, our boats,” Adams said. Officials will also monitor protests with drones, he said. “But as we saw last year, after having no specific threats, we get a threat.” During last year’s New Year’s Eve party, a machete-wielding man attacked three police officers a few blocks from Times Square. Security will also be heightened across France on Sunday, with 90,000 law enforcement officers set to be deployed, domestic intelligence chief Céline Berthon said Friday. Of those, 6,000 will be in Paris, where French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said over 1.5 million people are expected to attend celebrations on the Champs-Elysees. Speaking at a press conference, Darmanin cited a “very high terrorist threat” because, in part, of “what is happening in Israel and Palestine,” referring to the Israel-Hamas war. Darmanin said that police for the first time will be able to use drones as part of security work and that tens of thousands of firefighters and 5,000 soldiers would also be deployed. New Year’s Eve celebrations in the French capital will center on the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, including DJ sets, fireworks and video projections on the Arc de Triomphe, highlighting “changes in the city and faces of the Games,” according to the press service of the City of Paris. Other planned events include “the largest Mexican wave ever performed” and a “giant karaoke.” Local authorities have instituted a ban on the sale of alcohol on and around the Champs Elysees on New Year’s Eve, and the public will not be able to access the area with glass bottles and flasks. The security challenge ahead of the Olympics was highlighted when a tourist was killed in a knife attack near the Eiffel Tower on Dec. 2. Large-scale attacks — such as that at the Bataclan in 2015, when Islamic extremists invaded the music hall and shot up cafe terraces, killing 130 people — also loom in memory. The knife attack raised concern in France and abroad about security for the Games that begin July 26, in just under seven months. But law enforcement officials appear eager to show off a security-ready Paris. In Muslim-majority Pakistan, the government has banned all New Year’s Eve celebrations as an act of solidarity with the Palestinians. In an overnight televised message, caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar urged Pakistanis to “show solidarity with the oppressed people of Gaza” by beginning the new year with simplicity. Kakar said Muslims across the world were saddened over Israel’s attacks on Gaza that resulted in the killings of thousands of innocent people.",

        "text": "US Military Launches Another Barrage Of Missiles Against Houthi Sites In Yemen (representative Image).   \n         Tel Aviv:  The Government of Israel has claimed that Yemen’s Houthi rebels seized an international cargo ship in the southern Red Sea en route to India. Israel has labeled it an ‘Iranian act of terrorism’ and a ‘very grave incident on a global level.’ The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the news, stating that the British-owned and Japanese-operated cargo ship was captured by the Houthis, allies of Tehran. Officials mentioned that there were no Israelis on the cargo ship.  \n             The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that a British-owned and Japanese-operated cargo ship was seized by the Houthis, allies of Tehran. Officials stated that there were no Israelis on the ship. “This is another Iranian act of terrorism that represents an escalation in Iran’s belligerence against the citizens of the free world, with concomitant international ramifications vis-a-vis the security of global shipping routes,” Netanyahu’s office said. On the other side, Houthis militia also confirmed the development. However, the outfit claimed that they seized an Israeli ship which was instantly rejected by the Israeli government. According to Houthis the ship from the southern Red Sea has been taken to a Yemeni port, the group said. \n             \n           “We are adhering to Islamic principles and values in our treatment of the ship’s crew,” stated a military spokesperson for the group. The ship was seized by the Houthis using a helicopter to deploy their fighters. Tel Aviv has identified the cargo ship as belonging to a British company and being operated by a Japanese firm. The vessel had 25 crew members of diverse nationalities, including Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Filipino, and Mexican. In a separate announcement today, a spokesperson for Yemen’s Iran-aligned militia declared their intention to target all ships owned or operated by Israeli companies or flying the Israeli flag. The militia urged countries to withdraw their citizens from the crews of such ships. Two U.S. defense officials, as reported by The Washington Post, confirmed that the Galaxy Leader ship was seized by the militia using a helicopter. A week ago, a leader from the Houthi group had proclaimed an escalation of attacks on Israel and Israeli ships in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandeb Strait. The group has been launching long-range missile and drone attacks on Israeli posts, aligning with Hamas militants in the ongoing conflict with Israel since October 7. Talking about Houthis, they The are originated as a Zaidi Shia Muslim movement in the 1990s, primarily situated in northern Yemen. Their opposition to the Sunni-dominated government has led to six armed conflicts with the Yemeni government since 2004. The pivotal moment came in 2014 when they took control of the capital, Sanaa, compelling the government to go into exile. Subsequently, the Houthis became embroiled in a civil war against a coalition led by Saudi Arabia, comprising Sunni Arab states. This conflict has been ongoing since then, shaping the complex and volatile political landscape in Yemen.",

        "title": "Israel Reveals Signs Of Hamas Activity At Shifa, But A Promised Command Center Remains Elusive",
        "description": "Days after taking control of the hospital, the military has yet to unveil this purported center.",
        "text": "In this image taken from a video released by the Israeli Defense Forces, Wednesday, Nov. 15, 2023, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, holds up a bullet proof vest with a Hamas insignia that was found along with weapons the IDF says were found in a medical closet at the MRI center at al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. (Israel Defense Forces via AP)   \n         Jerusalem:  Three weeks ago, the Israeli military unveiled a detailed 3D model of Gaza’s Shifa Hospital – showing a series of underground installations that it said was part of an elaborate Hamas command and control center under the territory’s largest health-care center.  \n             Days after taking control of the hospital, the military has yet to unveil this purported center. But it has released videos of weapons allegedly seized inside the hospital, a tunnel running through the complex and videos appearing to show Hamas militants dragging hostages through the hospital’s hallways. Israel says there will be much more to come. What Israel finds – or fails to find – could play a large part in its efforts to rally international support for its war against Hamas, launched on Oct. 7 in response to a bloody cross-border attack by the Islamic militant group. Here is a closer look at Israel’s raid on the Shifa Hospital. \n             \n           WHY DOES IT MATTER? Gaza’s hospitals have played a central role in the dueling narratives surrounding the war. Hospitals enjoy special protected status under the international laws of war. But they can lose that status if they are used for military purposes. Israel has long claimed that Hamas uses hospitals, schools, mosques and residential neighborhoods as human shields. In particular, it says Hamas has hidden command centers and bunkers underneath the sprawling grounds of Shifa. The United States says its own intelligence corroborates those claims. Hamas denies the allegations. Israel says other hospitals are similarly used for military purposes. It has ordered the evacuations of a number of Gaza hospitals, including Shifa, as it presses ahead with its ground operation against Hamas. The U.N. and other international organizations say these evacuations have endangered patients and overwhelmed the remaining hospitals in the besieged territory. With Israel already facing mounting international criticism of its offensive, a failure to uncover a significant Hamas presence could step up the pressure to halt the operation. Israel has vowed to press ahead until it destroys Hamas. WHAT HAS ISRAEL FOUND? The Israeli military has released videos showing AK47s, ammunition and other military equipment it said was found in the hospital’s MRI unit. It also said it discovered a Toyota pickup truck filled with weapons in a hospital garage. The vehicle appears to be the same type of truck used by Hamas militants during the Oct. 7 incursion. On Sunday, it released a video of a 55-meter (60-yard) tunnel in a hospital courtyard. The underground structure was heavily fortified and led to a blast-proof door with an opening that Israel says was meant to be used by Hamas snipers. It also released security-camera images of Hamas militants escorting what Israel said were two hostages – one from Thailand, the other from Nepal – who were seized in the Oct. 7 cross-border attack. One video showed a group of men forcefully dragging their hostage through the hospital’s main entrance and down a hallway. The other showed a group of men, including at least one gunman, pushing a motionless man on a stretcher in a hallway. Hospital workers could be seen in both videos looking on. The videos had time stamps from the morning of Oct. 7, matching the time of the attack. But the faces of the two purported hostages were blurred, making it difficult to verify the authenticity of the videos. The army also released photos of what it said were two military jeeps stolen from the Israeli military. The photos showed the jeeps parked in the hospital complex on the morning of the attack. “By now the truth is clear: Hamas wages war from hospitals, wages terror from hospitals,” said the Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari. “Everyone who cares about the future of humanity must condemn Hamas.” Hamas played down the images, saying it had been offering the men in its custody medical treatment. “We put our fighters at risk to guarantee the injured prisoners the best treatment possible in the Gaza Strip’s hospitals,” the militant group said in a statement. Osama Hamdan, a top Hamas leader based in Beirut, acknowledged that Israel could find a tunnel “here or there.” “We don’t deny there are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels in and around Gaza,” he told a news conference. But he said Hamas does not use hospitals for militant activities. WHAT HASN’T ISRAEL FOUND? Israel has not said where the Shifa tunnel leads to or given specifics on what it was used for. It also has not yet provided anything close to the images of underground bunkers and conference rooms it showed in that Oct. 27 illustration. Hamdan, the Hamas leader, mocked the Israeli discoveries so far. “The Israelis said there was a command and control center, which means that the matter is greater than just a tunnel,” he said. Israeli military officials say those initial illustrations were “conceptual” and not meant to be taken literally. They have also promised many more discoveries as troops continue the painstaking task of scouring a complex spread out over more than 10 acres (40,000 square meters). “It’s going to take time,” said Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, another military spokesman.",

        "title": "Israeli Cabinet To Consider Possible Deal For Release Of Some Hostages Held By Hamas",
        "description": "The announcement came as Israeli troops battled Palestinian militants in an urban refugee camp in northern Gaza and around hospitals overcrowded with patients and sheltering families.",
        "text": "Smoke rises following an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip, as seen from southern Israel, Tuesday, Nov. 21, 2023. (AP Photo/Leo Correa)   \n         Jerusalem:  Israel and the Hamas militant group on Tuesday appeared close to a deal to temporarily halt their devastating six-week war so that dozens of hostages being held in the Gaza Strip could be freed in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli prisons. Hamas predicted a Qatari-mediated deal could be reached in “the coming hours,” while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was convening top decision-makers to discuss the matter.  \n             “We are advancing,” Netanyahu told troops during a visit to a training base. “I hope there will be good news soon.” The announcement came as Israeli troops battled Palestinian militants in an urban refugee camp in northern Gaza and around hospitals overcrowded with patients and sheltering families. Netanyahu’s office said the special three-member War Cabinet met Tuesday and would be followed by meetings of his Security Cabinet, a forum of senior security officials, and the full Cabinet. \n             \n           There was no word on whether a vote would take place, and details of a deal were not released. Israeli media reported that an agreement would include a five-day halt in Israel’s offensive in Gaza and the release of 50 hostages held by Hamas in exchange for some 150 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Israel’s Channel 12 TV said the first releases would take place Thursday or Friday and continue for several days. Talks have repeatedly stalled. But even if a deal is reached, it would not mean an end to the war, which erupted on Oct. 7 after Hamas militants stormed across the border into southern Israel and killed at least 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and kidnapped some 240 others. THE TOLL IN GAZA In weeks of Israeli airstrikes and a ground invasion, more than 11,000 Palestinians have been killed, two-thirds of them women and minors, and more than 2,700 others are missing and believed to be buried under rubble, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The ministry says it has been unable to update its count since Nov. 11 because of the health sector’s collapse. Gaza health officials say the toll has risen sharply since, and hospitals continue to report deaths from daily strikes, often dozens at a time. The Health Ministry in the West Bank last reported a toll of 13,300 but stopped providing its own count Tuesday without giving a reason. Because of that, and because officials there declined to explain in detail how they tracked deaths after Nov. 11, the AP decided to stop reporting its count. The Health Ministry toll does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed thousands of Hamas militants but has not provided evidence for its count. In southern Lebanon, an Israeli strike killed two journalists with Al-Mayadeen TV, according to the Hezbollah-allied Pan-Arab network and Lebanese officials. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. A separate Israeli drone strike in Lebanon killed four Hamas members, a Palestinian official and a Lebanon security official said. The Israeli military has been trading fire almost daily across the border with Lebanon’s Hezbollah group and Palestinian militants since the outbreak of the war. TALKS ON HOSTAGES Israel, the United States and Qatar, which mediates with Hamas, have negotiated for weeks over a hostage release that would be paired with a temporary cease-fire and the entry of more aid. In Washington, President Joe Biden said Tuesday that a deal on releasing some hostages was “very close.” “We could bring some of these hostages home very soon,” he said at the White House. Qatar’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Majed al-Ansari expressed optimism, telling reporters that “we are at the closest point we ever had been in reaching an agreement.” He added that negotiations were at a “critical and final stage.” Izzat Rishq, a senior Hamas official, said Tuesday that an agreement could be reached “in the coming hours,” in which Hamas would release captives and Israel would release Palestinian prisoners. Hamas’ leader-in-exile, Ismail Haniyeh, also said they were close to a deal. Israel’s Channel 12 TV, citing anonymous Israeli officials, said a truce could be extended and additional Palestinian prisoners released if there were additional hostages freed. FIGHTING IN JABALIYA AND AROUND HOSPITALS Inside Gaza, the front line of the war shifted to the Jabaliya refugee camp, a densely built district of concrete buildings near Gaza City that houses families displaced in the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. Israel has bombarded the area for weeks, and the military said Hamas fighters have regrouped there and in other eastern districts after being pushed out of much of Gaza City. The fighting in Jabaliya also affected two nearby hospitals, trapping hundreds of patients and displaced people sheltering inside. A strike Tuesday hit inside one of the facilities, al-Awda, killing four people, including three doctors, the hospital director told Al-Jazeera TV. The director, Ahmed Mahna, blamed the strike on Israel, a claim that AP could not independently confirm. Residents of Jabaliya said there was heavy fighting as Israeli forces tried to advance under the cover of airstrikes. “They are facing stiff resistance,” said Hamza Abu Mansour, a university student. The Israeli military said strikes hit three tunnel shafts where fighters were hiding and destroyed rocket launchers. Footage released by the military showed Israeli soldiers patrolling on foot as gunfire echoed around them. It was not possible to independently confirm details of the fighting. It’s unclear how many Palestinian civilians remain in northern Gaza, but the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees estimates that some 160,000 people are still in its shelters there, though it can no longer provide services. Thousands more still shelter in several hospitals in the north even after many fled south in recent weeks. Most hospitals are no longer operational. The hospital situation in Gaza is “catastrophic,” Michael Ryan, a senior World Health Organization official, said Monday. With Israeli troops surrounding the Indonesia Hospital, also near Jabaliya, staff had to bury 50 dead in the facility’s courtyard, a senior Health Ministry official in the hospital, Munir al-Boursh, told Al-Jazeera TV. Up to 600 wounded people and some 2,000 displaced Palestinians remain stranded at the hospital, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. A similar standoff played out in recent days at Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest, where over 250 patients and medical workers are stranded after the evacuation of 31 premature babies. Israel has provided evidence in recent days of a militant presence at Shifa. But it has yet to substantiate its claims that Hamas had a major command center beneath the facility, allegations denied by Hamas and hospital staff. DIRE CONDITIONS IN NORTH AND SOUTH Most of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have crowded into the southern section of the Gaza Strip, where Israeli strikes have continued and where the military says it intends to extend its ground invasion. Many are packed into U.N.-run schools and other facilities across the territory’s south or sleeping on the streets outside, even as winter rains have pelted the coastal enclave in recent days. There are shortages of food, water and fuel for generators across all of Gaza, which has had no central electricity for over a month. Strikes overnight crushed residential buildings in the Nusseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing at least 20 people, according to hospital officials. Footage from the scene showed the legs of five young boys sticking out from under a collapsed concrete slab of one home. Israel continues to strike what it says are militant targets throughout Gaza, often killing women and children. Israel accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields. (Jeffery reported from Cairo.

        "text": "About 50 children, mothers, and other women are to be freed by Hamas over 4-5 days, the report stated.   \n         Washington:  US President Joe Biden on Tuesday said efforts to retrieve hostages held by Hamas in Gaza since October 7 are “now very close” following extensive negotiations over the past six weeks, CNN reported.  “We’re now very close. Very close. And could bring some of these hostages home very soon. I don’t want to get into the details of things because nothing is done until it’s done. When we have more to say, we will. But things are looking good at the moment,” Biden said during a meeting at the White House.  \n             CNN previously reported that the deal would call for the release of 50 women and children hostages in exchange for a four-to-five-day pause in fighting and three Palestinian prisoners for every civilian hostage released, according to multiple sources. “We’ve been working on this intensively for weeks, as you all know,” Biden said, pointing to his own talks in recent days with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani and US officials on the ground in the region, according to CNN. On being asked by CNN’s MJ Lee for details on how many American hostages could be released, Biden declined to comment. \n             \n           “I’ll have plenty of time to talk about the hostages. Not now. I’m not going to tell you now,” he said. Meanwhile, the Israeli Cabinet will meet at 8 pm (Israeli local time) on Tuesday to approve a deal for the release of dozens of hostages from Gaza, The Times of Israel reported. About 50 children, mothers, and other women are to be freed by Hamas over 4-5 days, the report stated. Further, according to Israeli media, the agreement is focused on Israeli hostages, mainly women and children, with talks on releasing foreign hostages not currently on the table. The Israeli Prime Minister’s office stated in a release, “In light of developments on the issue of the release of our hostages, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will, this evening, convene the War Cabinet at 18:00, the Security Cabinet at 19:00, and the Government at 20:00.” Hamas and other terror factions in Gaza abducted some 240 people from Israel during the October 7 attacks, including about 40 children, elderly people and dozens of Thai and Nepali nationals. The hostage deal will include the release of some 150 to 300 Palestinian prisoners in Israel, among them female and minor prisoners, The Times of Israel reported citing Channel 12. Channel 12 stated further that the hostage releases could begin on Thursday or Friday. The report says the ceasefire could be extended to allow the release of more hostages following the initial 50 or so.",

        "text": "Israel-Hamas Strike A Deal PM Netanyahu Offers 'Lull In Fighting' In Return For Release Of 50 Hostages   \n         New Delhi:  The  Israel Palestine Conflict  turned into the  Israel-Hamas War  when on October 7, the Palestinian Islamist organisation  Hamas  fired 5000 rockets from the Gaza Strip on Israel killing many innocent people. It is almost going to be two months and the war between the two nations is still raging and till now, it did not seem to stop any time soon. In a major breakthrough, Israel and Hamas have struck a deal according to which the former is ready to offer a ‘lull in the fighting’ for a few days if the latter agrees to release around 50 Israelis it has held hostages.  Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ‘s office issued a statement on Wednesday, confirming the release of roughly 50 hostages abducted by the Hamas terror group in Gaza during the October 7 attack, reported The Times of Israel.

        "text": "Palestinians look at destruction by the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip in Rafah on Wednesday, Nov. 22, 2023. (AP Photo/Hatem Ali)   \n         Israel-Hamas Pause:  A cease-fire agreement between the Hamas militant group and Israel has been confirmed by both parties, along with Washington and Qatar, which helped broker the deal that would bring a temporary halt to the devastating war that is now in its seventh week.  \n             The Israeli government said that under an outline of the deal, Hamas is to free over a four-day period at least 50 of the roughly 240 hostages taken in its Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Qatar later confirmed the deal, saying the start time will be announced in the next 24 hours and it will last four days. The agreement would bring the first respite to war-weary Palestinians in Gaza, where more than 11,000 people have been killed, according to health authorities. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said before the Cabinet voted early Wednesday to back the agreement that the war would continue even if a deal was reached. Some 1,200 people have been killed in Israel, mostly during the initial incursion by Hamas. Currently: — Truce deal raises hopes of freeing hostages in Gaza and halting worst Mideast violence in decades \n             \n           — South African lawmakers vote in favor of closing Israel’s embassy and cutting diplomatic ties — Bahrain government websites are briefly inaccessible after a cyberattack over the Israel-Hamas war — Gaza health officials say they lost the ability to count dead as Israeli offensive intensifies — Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war Here’s what’s happening in the war: WHO STAFF MEMBER, FAMILY ARE KILLED IN STRIKE CAIRO  — The World Health Organization says one of its local staff members in Gaza was killed along with her family when a strike hit the home where they were sheltering. It said Dima Abdullatif Mohammed Alhaj, 29, was killed Tuesday along with her husband, their 6-month-old son and her two brothers. The U.N. health agency said in a statement late Tuesday that over 50 people were reportedly killed in the strike. It was not immediately possible to confirm the report or to determine who carried out the strike. Israel has launched airstrikes across Gaza in the war triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. Palestinian militants have fired rockets at Israel, some of which have fallen short. Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative for the Palestinian territories, said Alhaj “was a wonderful person with a radiant smile, cheerful, positive, respectful. She was a true team player.” Alhaj, who had worked as a patient administrator with WHO since 2019, was among hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled from northern Gaza to shelter in the south. She had left her home in Gaza City and was staying with relatives. WHO said her death “is another example of the senseless loss in this conflict.” POPE BEGS FOR PEACE AND AN END TO ‘TERRORISM’ VATICAN CITY  — Pope Francis has met separately with Israeli and Palestinian delegations and begged for peace and an end to what he called terrorism and “passions that are killing everyone.” In encounters arranged before the Israeli-Hamas hostage deal was announced, Francis met Wednesday with relatives of hostages held in Gaza following Hamas’ Oct. 7 raid in southern Israel. And he met separately with a delegation of Palestinians with relatives who are prisoners in Israel. Speaking at the end of his weekly general audience, Francis said he heard from both how much they are suffering and the toll that the war was taking. In the audience were people holding Palestinian flags and scarves as well as small posters showing apparent bodies in a ditch and the word “Genocide” written underneath. Francis said: “Here we’ve gone beyond war. This isn’t war, this is terrorism. Please, let us go forward for peace. Pray for peace, pray a lot for peace.” He also asked for God to help both Israeli and Palestinian people “resolve problems and not go forward with passions that are killing everyone in the end.” Francis has spoken out repeatedly for an end to the war. ISRAEL PUBLISHES LIST OF PALESTINIAN PRISONERS WHO COULD BE RELEASED UNDER HOSTAGE DEAL TEL AVIV, Israel  — Israel’s Justice Ministry has published a list of 300 Palestinian detainees and prisoners who could potentially be released in a hostage deal. Most of those on the list published Wednesday are teenagers arrested over the past year for relatively minor offenses, including throwing rocks or alleged incitement. None was convicted of murder, though some served sentences for attempted murder. The youngest detainee on the list is 14, and it also includes around 40 women. The detainees are to be released to their homes in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. According to the truce-for-hostages deal announced Wednesday, 50 hostages will be released over four days, likely starting Thursday, during which fighting will pause. After that, every additional 10 hostages released will result in one additional day in the pause and the release of additional Palestinian prisoners. Israel is expected to release 150 Palestinian prisoners in the first four days, though the Ministry of Justice published the list of 300 in case the deal is extended. Under Israeli law, the public has 24 hours to object to any release. EVACUATION OF PATIENTS TRAPPED IN SHIFA HOSPITAL BEGINS CAIRO  — The evacuation of patients trapped in Shifa Hospital in Gaza City has begun, the Palestinian Red Crecent says. The charity said 14 ambulances arrived at the hospital on Wednesday, and the evacuation has been coordinated with the United Nations and Doctors without Borders medical group. Ashraf al-Qidra, the spokesperson for Gaza’s Health Ministry, has said there were over 250 patients at the facility, which was besieged by the Israeli military earlier this month. Over 400 displaced people sheltering in the facility have also been trapped there, he said. Israel has accused Hamas of using the hospital, the largest in Gaza, to conduct militant operations. Hamas and health officials have denied the allegation. Over the weekend, the World Health Organization coordinated the evacuation of 31 premature babies from Shifa Hospital to southern Gaza. Of them, 28 babies were later transferred to Egypt. EU OFFICIAL SAYS HALT IN FIGHTING MUST BE USED TO FLOOD GAZA WITH AID BRUSSELS  — The European Union’s crisis management chief has welcomed the Israeli hostage release agreement and says the halt in fighting that is part of the deal must be used to flood Gaza with desperately needed aid. “We hope that the agreement on a pause of hostilities that has just been reached will allow for a substantial surge in humanitarian aid delivery into and within Gaza,” Crisis Management Commissioner Janez Lenarcic said Wednesday. “We certainly hope that this will not be a one-off,” he told EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, France, and called for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses throughout Gaza.” The 27-nation EU is the world’s biggest aid donor to the Palestinians. Lenarcic said 15 EU aid cargo flights have been sent, with most of that aid already in Gaza, and that more is on the way. The bloc insists that more trucks must be allowed through the Rafah crossing point with Egypt and other corridors opened. Lenarcic said getting into Gaza is “extremely challenging” and that fewer than 50 trucks a day make it through, a number which he described as “woefully inadequate.” He welcomed Israel’s decision to allow some fuel in, but said it only covers about one third of Gaza’s basic needs. BRITAIN URGES BOTH SIDES TO ENSURE HOSTAGE AGREEMENT IS ‘DELIVERED IN FULL’ LONDON  — The British government has welcomed an agreement to release some of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza and urged all parties to ensure it is “delivered in full.” Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the agreement was “a crucial step towards providing relief to the families of the hostages and addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.” “This pause provides an important opportunity to ensure much greater volumes of food, fuel and other life-saving aid can reach Gaza on a sustained basis,” he said. “The U.K. will continue to work with all partners in the region to secure the release of all hostages, restore security and reach a long-term political solution which enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace.” CHINA SAYS IT HOPES TRUCE AGREEMENT WILL EASE TENSIONS BEIJING  — The Chinese government says it welcomes the four-day truce reached between Israel and Hamas. “We welcome the provisional truce reached by the parties concerned and hope it will help to alleviate the humanitarian crisis, de-escalate the conflict and ease tensions,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing in Beijing on Wednesday. China has been calling for a cease-fire and refrained from criticizing the initial Hamas attack on Israel that started the latest conflict. A delegation of foreign ministers from Arab nations and Indonesia held talks with China’s foreign minister this week as they started a tour to press their case for a cease-fire with the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. RUSSIA SAYS TRUCE IS A STEP TOWARD ENDING HOSTILITIES MOSCOW  — The Kremlin on Wednesday hailed a deal between Israel and Hamas for a halt to the war and the release of hostages as step toward ending the hostilities. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the announcement of the deal was “the first good news from Gaza in a long time.” Speaking in a conference call with reporters, he noted that Russia along with most other countries had called for a truce and humanitarian pauses, adding that “only on the basis of such pauses future attempts to find a lasting settlement to the problem could be made.” FRANCE HOPEFUL ITS NATIONALS WILL BE AMONG THE FIRST RELEASED UNDER DEAL PARIS  — France’s foreign minister says she’s hopeful that French nationals will be among the first hostages released as part of a truce deal between Israel and Hamas. “We hope that French nationals are among them and even, if possible, among the first group that will be released,” the minister, Catherine Colonna, said Wednesday on France Inter radio. “We are working for that.” France counts eight people missing, some of them confirmed as hostages, from the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas militants that ignited their latest and deadliest war. France also counts 40 killed in the attack. Colonna said that not all the hostages taken on Oct. 7 were captured by Hamas. But she said that in the course of negotiations, the militant group has said that “it could assemble together all of the hostages.” French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday welcomed the truce agreement. In a message on X, formerly Twitter, Macron said “we are working tirelessly to ensure that all hostages are released.” He also hoped the truce will “enable aid to be brought in” and help the Gaza people. RED CROSS SAYS IT’S STANDING BY TO ASSIST SWAP DUBAI, United Arab Emirates  — The International Committee of the Red Cross says it is standing by to assist any swap in the Israel-Hamas war. “Currently, we are actively engaged in talks with the parties to help carry out any humanitarian agreement they reach,” the Red Cross said. “As a neutral intermediary, it is important to clarify that we are not part of the negotiations, and we do not make decisions on the substance of it. Our role is to facilitate the implementation, once the parties agree.” US STRIKES BACK AT IRAN-BACKED MILITANTS IN IRAQ BAGHDAD  — The United States military said Wednesday that it has carried out strikes against Iran-backed groups in Iraq that have launched attacks on U.S. forces. The U.S. Central Command said in a statement Wednesday that its forces had “conducted discrete, precision strikes against two facilities in Iraq … in direct response to the attacks against U.S. and Coalition forces by Iran and Iran-backed groups,” including one on Tuesday involving the use of close-range ballistic missiles. Two officials with Iranian-backed militias in Iraq said the strikes hit three locations in the area of Jurf al-Sakhar south of Baghdad, killing eight members of the Kataeb Hezbollah militant group. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Iranian-backed militants have launched dozens of attacks on bases and facilities housing U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria since Oct. 17. While most of the more than five dozen attacks have been ineffective, at least 60 U.S. personnel have reported minor injuries. The militant groups have said the strikes are in retaliation for U.S. support of Israel in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. (Qassim Abdul-Zahra reported from Baghdad.)",

The responsible officials are checking the details of the list and are currently in contact with all of the families.” Earlier in the day, a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the highly release of the first group of 50 Israeli hostages held by Hamas as part of a hostage deal would not take place on Thursday, as previously announced, but only on Friday, The Times of Israel reported. National Security Council chairman Tzachi Hanegbi released a statement that said the negotiations for the hostages “are constantly progressing” and “the release will begin according to the original agreement between the parties, and not before Friday.” Hamas is holding 239 people as hostages in Gaza, including foreign nationals from 26 nations, according to figures from the Israeli military, CNN reported. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office issued a statement on Wednesday, confirming the release of roughly 50 hostages abducted by the Hamas terror group in Gaza during the October 7 attack, reported The Times of Israel. However, the statement did not specify how ministers voted on the decision. After announcing the decision, the Israel PM’s office on Wednesday stressed that the Israeli government is committed to bringing all the abductees home, reported The Times of Israel. The Israeli government is committed to bringing all the abductees home. Tonight, the government approved the outline for the first stage of achieving this goal, under which at least 50 abductees–women and children–will be released over a span of four days, during which there will be a lull in the fighting,” the statement said.",

        "text": "New Delhi:  In a significant development, a Qatar court has accepted the appeal backed by the Indian government against the death sentence of eight former Indian Navy officials last month. The court is currently reviewing the appeal, with sources indicating an imminent next hearing, as reported by India Today.  \n             The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) stated on Thursday, “The judgment remains confidential. The initial court’s verdict was shared with our legal team. Pursuing all available legal options, an appeal has been submitted. We are maintaining contact with Qatari authorities.” In October, a court in Qatar sentenced as many as eight former Indian Navy personnel to death after they were detained in the country for over a year. India reacted to the ruling sharply and called it “deeply” shocking and vowed to explore all legal options in the case. The punishment was announced after the authorities rejected the bail pleas of the Navy veterans several times. \n \n In August 2022, Qatar detained eight former Indian Navy officers on suspicion of working as spies for Israel while they were employed by a company based in the Middle Eastern nation. The former officers — Captain Navtej Singh Gill, Captain Birendra Kumar Verma, Captain Saurabh Vasisht, Commander Amit Nagpal, Commander Purnendu Tiwari, Commander Sugunakar Pakala, Commander Sanjeev Gupta, and Sailor Ragesh — were arrested by Qatar intelligence agency from Doha on August 30, 2022. \n \n All of the former Navy officers have a distinguished service record of up to 20 years in the Indian Navy and have held important positions including that of instructors in the force.",

        "text": "The hostages will be brought to a meeting point where Israeli forces will verify their identities before escorting them into Israel via a side gate at the Kerem Shalom crossing.   \n         Tel Aviv:  A four-day truce in the Israel-Hamas war came to an effect on Friday and exchange of hostages is expected to take place later in the day, mediator Qatar said. Notably, the four-day truce in fighting comes after nearly seven weeks of intense fighting between Israel and Hamas.  \n             The ceasefire started at 10.30 AM IST, and the first group of hostages will be released by Hamas around 7.30 pm IST, according to Qatar’s foreign ministry. The “first batch” of hostages would consist of 13 women and children from the same families. However, the number would rise up to 50 over the four days, according to the deal brokered by Qatar and the US. In the meantime, Israel sounded sirens in two villages near the Gaza Strip, and warned of possible Palestinian rocket attacks from the Hamas-ruled enclave just minutes after a truce came into force. Earlier on Wednesday, an Israeli official told CNN that the truce will begin at 10 am local time on Thursday, followed by the release of at least 50 women and children among the more than 230 people being held prisoner in Gaza. However, those preparations were postponed late Wednesday, just hours before the cease-fire was supposed to begin. \n             \n           “Nothing is finalised until it’s actually happening. And even amid the process, changes might occur at any moment,” Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in his daily press briefing on Thursday. According to CNN, Hagari asserted that the Israeli army continues to fight in the Gaza Strip “at this hour,” pointing out that once the pause goes into effect, the soldiers of the Israeli Defence Forces will be stationed along the “truce lines” established inside the territory. The conflict in Gaza escalated after the October 7 attack by Hamas, where about 2,500 terrorists breached the border into Israel from the Gaza Strip, leading to casualties and the seizure of hostages. Hamas terrorists seized about 240 hostages during the assault when they surged across Gaza’s militarised border into southern Israel to kill around 1,200 people, mostly civilians who were massacred at their homes and at a music festival amid brutal atrocities, The Times of Israel reported. The hostages were of all ages and including young children and elderly people, as well as Thai and Nepali nationals.",

        "text": "Israel Hamas War Release Of Hostages   \n         New Delhi:  The decades-long  Israel Palestine Conflict  completely turned into a war on October 7, 2023 when the Palestinian Islamist Organisation,  Hamas  fired 5000 rockets on Israel from the  Gaza Strip . Since then, the war has continued, killing thousands of innocent people on both sides and incurring losses that will affect generations to come. Amid the war that has been going on for almost two months, for the first time there has been a temporary ceasefire and people held hostages are being ‘returned’. After a long delay, 17  hostages have been released  by the Hamas terror group and sent to Egypt, according to The Times of Israel. Reportedly, the  Red Cross  has handed these hostages to Egypt, according to the  Israel Defence Forces (IDF) .  \n             Hamas Releases Hostages, Israeli Officials To Verify List Of Names As per the details, the hostages include 13 Israeli citizens and four Thais, reported The Times of Israel on Sunday. The convoy carrying the hostages will head to the Kerem Shalom crossing, where Israeli officials will verify the list of names. “IDF representatives are updating their families regularly,” the IDF adds. Meanwhile, some of the families of these hostages have begun to identify and confirm the identities of these hostages who are on their way to Israel. Hostages Include 9 And 12-Year-Old Girls The hostages include a 12-year-old girl named Hila Rotem, who was abducted by Hamas terrorists with her mother, Raya Rotem, 54, who was not released, according to The Times of Israel. Another hostage Emily Hand, 9, was initially thought to have been among those killed in the attack on Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7. Emily was at a sleepover at a friend’s house on the Kibbutz when she was abducted. Noam Or, 17 and Alma Or, 13, were also taken hostage by Hamas terrorists from their home in Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7, alongside their father, Dror Or, 48, and their cousin, Liam Or, 18. Meanwhile, their mother, Yonat Or, was killed in the attack. However, Dror and Liam are assumed to remain hostages in Gaza, reported The Times of Israel. \n             \n           Moreover, according to The Times of Israel, most of the Israeli hostages are believed to have been abducted from Kibbutz Be’eri.

        "text": "‘Pledge To Fight Against Acts Of Terror’: US Envoy Pays Homage To Victims Of 26/11 Mumbai Terror Attacks   \n         Mumbai:  United States Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti paid tributes to all those who lost their lives in the Mumbai 26/11 terror attacks. Remembering the victims at the US Consulate in Mumbai on the 15th anniversary of the 26/11 terror attacks, he reaffirmed Washington’s commitment to fight alongside New Delhi against terrorism. ‘Today marks the 15th anniversary of the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai. We honour the memory of the victims lost and pledge to continue to fight against acts of terror together with the Government of India,’ Garcetti posted on X (formerly Twitter).Earlier in the day, Israel envoy Naor Gilon also remembered the victims at the Chabad House memorial, which has the names of all victims engraved on its walls.  \n             “15 years since the #MumbaiTerrorAttack #UnitedWeStand. This picture is from the Nariman (Chabad) House rooftop memorial where the names of all #Mumbai2611 victims are engraved. Om Shanti,” Gilon posted on X. It is worth noting that, six Jews were among the 166 people who were killed during the terror attacks in Mumbai. Recently, Israel officially designated Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), the terrorist outfit responsible for the 26/11 attacks, as terrorist organisation. The action has been taken sans any request to that effect by the Union government. \n             \n           Meanwhile, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also paid his respects to all the people who lost their lives in the Mumbai attacks, saying India’s quest to bring the perpetrators of these horrific acts to justice continues. “It is 15 years today since the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. Our quest to bring those responsible for planning and executing these horrific acts to justice continues,” Jaishankar posted on X (formerly Twitter). 26 terror attack in Mumbai A group of heavily-armed terrorists from the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba infiltrated in mumbai through sea route and unleashed mayhem on the night of 26/11, 15 years ago, spraying bullets on unarmed civilians at multiple key public installations in the city. The attacks resulted in more than 166 casualties, including foreigners, and left over 300 people injured. Although one of the terrorists, Ajmal Amir Qasab, was captured alive, the remaining assailants were neutralized during the final stages of the siege, spanning four days. As many as 18 security personnel, from the state police and the elite National Security Guard (NSG), laid down their lives during the dreadful attacks.  The coordinated terror attacks by the Lashkar men sent shockwaves across the country and the world. The attacks claimed the lives of several notable figures, including the then Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) chief Hemant Karkare, Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan of the NSG, Mumbai’s Additional Police Commissioner Ashok Kamte, Senior Police Inspector Vijay Salaskar, and Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Tukaram Omble. Landmarks such as the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, the Oberoi Trident, the Taj Mahal Hotel, Leopold Cafe, Cama Hospital, and the Nariman House Jewish Community Centre (now renamed Nariman Light House) were targeted during the 26/11 attacks. Ajmal Amir Qasab, the lone surviving terrorist, was captured and arrested at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station, commonly known as CST. In May 2010, Qasab received a death sentence and was executed in a maximum security prison in Pune city two years later. Despite the passage of several years, the emotional wounds from the horrifying terror attacks linger in public memory, a testament to the enduring impact of the mayhem that unfolded over four days.",

        "description": "Jewish schoolchildren face bullying on their way to class, or — in one instance — have been asked to explain Israel’s actions, according to Britain's Community Security Trust.",
        "text": "FILE - Protesters gather for a pro-Palestinian demonstration, in Rome, on Oct. 28, 2023. Antisemitism is spiking across Europe after Hamas' Oct. 7 massacre and Israel's bombardment of Gaza, worrying Jews from London to Geneva and Berlin. (AP Photo/Andrew Medichini, File)   \n         Geneva:  As he sits in Geneva, Michel Dreifuss does not feel all that far away from the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7 and Israel’s subsequent bombardment of Gaza. The ripples are rolling through Europe and upending assumptions both global and intimate — including those about his personal safety as a Jew.  \n             “Yesterday I bought a tear-gas spray canister at a military-equipment surplus store,” the 64-year-old retired tech sector worker said recently at a rally to mark a month since the Hamas killings. The choice, he says, is a “precaution,” driven by a surge of antisemitism in Europe. Last month’s slayings of about 1,200 people in Israel by armed Palestinian militants represented the biggest killing of Jews since the Holocaust. The fallout from it, and from Israel’s intense military response that health officials in Hamas-controlled Gaza say has killed at least 13,300 Palestinians, has extended to Europe. In doing so, it has shaken a continent all too familiar with deadly anti-Jewish hatred for centuries. The past century is of particular note, of course. Concern about rising antisemitism in Europe is fueled in part by what happened to Jews before and during World War II, and that makes it particularly fearsome for those who may be only one or two generations removed from people who were the victims of riots against Jews and Nazi brutality. \n             \n           What most chills many Jews interviewed is what they see as the lack of empathy for the Israelis killed during the early morning massacre and for the relatives of the hostages — about 30 of whom are children — suspended in an agonizing limbo. “What really upsets me,” said Holocaust survivor Herbert Traube said at a Paris event commemorating the 85th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the 1938 government-backed pogroms against Jews in Germany and Austria, “is to see that there isn’t a massive popular reaction against this.” ACTS OF ANTISEMITISM — AND HOW THAT’S DEFINED Antisemitism is broadly defined as hatred of Jews. But a debate has been raging for years over what actions and words should be labeled antisemitic. Criticism of Israel’s policies and antisemitism have long been conflated by Israeli leaders such as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and by some watchdog groups. Critics say that blurring helps undermine opposition to the country’s policies and amps up perceptions that any utterance or incident against Israeli policy is antisemitic. Some language — whether for or against Israel or the Palestinians – “makes it sound like a football match,” says Susan Neiman of the Einstein Forum in Potsdam, Germany. “We are perpetuating the idea that you’ve got to be on one side or the other instead of being on the side of human rights and justice,” she said. Others argue that antisemites often use criticism of Israel as a placeholder for expressing their views. The list of examples of anti-Jewish sentiment since the Oct. 7 attacks is long and documented by governments and watchdog groups across Europe. —Little more than a month after the attack in Israel, the French Interior Ministry said 1,247 antisemitic incidents had been reported since Oct. 7, nearly three times the total for all of 2022. —Denmark’s main Jewish association said cases were up 24 times from the average of the last nine months. —The Community Security Trust, which tracks antisemitic incidents in Britain, reported more than 1,000 such events — the most ever recorded for a 28-day period. That all comes despite widespread denunciations of anti-Jewish hatred — and support for Israel — from leaders in Europe since the attack. Some of Europe’s Jews say they see it on the streets and the news. Jewish schoolchildren face bullying on their way to class, or — in one instance — have been asked to explain Israel’s actions, according to Britain’s Community Security Trust. There’s been talk of blending in better: covering skullcaps in public and perhaps hiding mezuzahs, the traditional symbol on doorposts of Jewish homes. In Russia, a riot broke out at an airport in which there were some antisemitic chants and posters from a crowd of men looking for passengers who had arrived from Israel. A Berlin synagogue was firebombed. An assailant stabbed a Jewish woman twice in the stomach at her home in Lyon, France, according to her lawyer. In Prague’s Little Quarter last month, staffers at the well-known Hippopotamus bar refused to serve beer to several tourists from Israel and their Czech guides, and some patrons served up insults. Police had to step in. In Berlin, Jews are still reeling from an attempted firebombing of a synagogue last month. “Some of us are in a state of panic,” said Anna Segal, 37, the manager of the Kahal Adass Jisroel in Berlin, a community of 450 members. COMING TO GRIPS WITH A FEELING OF DREAD Some community members are changing how they live, Segal said. Students no longer wear uniforms. Kindergarten classes don’t leave the building for field trips or the playground next door. Some members no longer call taxis, or they hesitate to order deliveries to their homes. Hebrew-speaking in public is fading. Some wonder if they should move to Israel. “I hear more and more from people from the Jewish community who say they feel safer and more comfortable in Israel now than in Germany, despite the war and all the rockets,” Segal said. “Because they don’t have to hide there.” And in pro-Palestinian demonstrations, some protesters are shouting, “ from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.” Some say that’s a call for Palestinian freedom and is not anti-Jewish but anti-Israel; the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea includes not only Israel, but also the West Bank and east Jerusalem, where Palestinians have lived under Israeli occupation since 1967. Many Jews, though, say the chant is inherently anti-Jewish and calls for the destruction of Israel. Faced with fears that antisemitism will spread, communities are taking action. A hotline has been set up in France to help provide psychological support for Jews. The Community Security Trust, which aims to protect the Jewish community and foster good relations with others, has joined with the British government to distribute primers on how to address antisemitism in primary and secondary schools. Peggy Hicks, a director at the U.N. human rights office, says the actions of governments and political movements are fair game for criticism but warned against discrimination, which the Geneva-based office has long battled. In the chaos of the past weeks, she sees reason to hope. “I’ve been amazed in the course of my working in human rights about the amount of compassion and the resilience of of human beings,” Hicks said. “People who have lost children and come together on both sides of a conflict, who have shared a loss — but from opposing sides — and who have found a way to get past the fact that they should actually be enemies.” She added: “I don’t think everybody has the ability to show that kind of courage. But the fact that it exists, I think, gives us all something to aspire to.” (Kellman reported from London.

        "title": "Hamas Releases Third Group Of Hostages As Part Of Truce Deal, While Netanyahu Visits Gaza",
        "description": "In all, nine children ages 17 and younger were on the list, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office.",
        "text": "Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, centre, greets soldiers as he visits the Gaza Strip, where he received security briefings with commanders and soldiers and visited one of the tunnels that has been revealed. (Avi Ohayon/GPO/Handout via AP)   \n         Jerusalem:  The fragile cease-fire between Israel and Hamas was back on track Sunday as the militants freed 17 more hostages, including 14 Israelis and the first American, in a third set of releases under a four-day truce. Red Cross representatives transferred the hostages out of Gaza. Some were handed over directly to Israel, while others left through Egypt. Israel’s army said one was airlifted directly to a hospital.  \n             The Israeli hostages ranged in age from 4 to 84 and included Abigail Edan, a 4-year-old girl whose parents were killed in the Hamas attack that started the war on Oct. 7. The U.S. identified her as the first American hostage freed; White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told NBC’s “Meet the Press” the U.S. had reason to believe an American hostage would be released and said there were hopes it would be her. In all, nine children ages 17 and younger were on the list, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. Separately, Hamas said it had released one of the Russian hostages it was holding, “in response to the efforts of Russian President Vladimir Putin” and as a show of appreciation for Moscow’s position on the war. Israeli army radio had reported that it was an Israeli-Russian dual national. Israel was to free 39 Palestinian prisoners later Sunday as part of the deal. A fourth exchange is expected on Monday — the last day of the cease-fire during which a total of 50 hostages and 150 Palestinian prisoners are to be freed. All are women and minors. \n             \n           International mediators led by the U.S. and Qatar are trying to extend the cease-fire. Ahead of the latest release, Netanyahu visited the Gaza Strip, where he spoke with troops. “We are making every effort to return our hostages, and at the end of the day we will return every one,” he said, adding that “we are continuing until the end, until victory. Nothing will stop us.” It was not immediately clear where he went inside Gaza. A BREAK IN THE FIGHTING The cease-fire agreement has brought the first significant pause in seven weeks of war, marked by the deadliest Israeli-Palestinian violence in decades and vast destruction and displacement across the Gaza Strip. Hamas and other militant groups seized around 240 people during the rampage across southern Israel that ignited the war. Fifty-eight have been released, one was freed by Israeli forces and two were found dead inside Gaza. Pressure from hostages’ families has sharpened the dilemma facing Israel’s leaders, who seek to eliminate Hamas as a military and governing power while returning all the captives. The war has claimed the lives of more than 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians killed by Hamas in the initial attack. More than 13,300 Palestinians have been killed, roughly two thirds of them women and minors, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza. The cease-fire, which began Friday, was brokered by Qatar and Egypt and the United States. Israel has said the truce can be extended by an extra day for every additional 10 hostages freed, but has vowed to quickly resume its offensive once it ends. Sullivan said the U.S. is working “with all sides on the possibility that this deal gets extended to additional hostages beyond the initial 50.” HAMAS COMMANDER KILLED Hamas announced the death of Ahmed al-Ghandour, who was in charge of northern Gaza and a member of its top military council. He is the highest-ranking militant known to have been killed in the fighting. Israel’s military confirmed the death. Al-Ghandour, believed to have been around 56 years old, had survived at least three Israeli attempts on his life and was involved in a cross-border attack in 2006 in which Palestinian militants captured an Israeli soldier, according to the Counter Extremism Project, an advocacy group based in Washington. Hamas said that he was killed along with three other senior militants, including Ayman Siam, who Israel says was in charge of Hamas’ rocket-firing unit. The Israeli military mentioned both men in a Nov. 16 statement, saying it had targeted an underground complex where Hamas leaders were hiding. The Israeli military claims to have killed thousands of militants, without providing evidence, including several mid-ranking commanders it has identified by name. AID AND RESPITE IN GAZA The pause has given some respite to Gaza’s 2.3 million people, still reeling from relentless Israeli bombardment that has driven three-quarters of the population from their homes and leveled residential areas. Rocket fire from Gaza militants into Israel also went silent. War-weary Palestinians in northern Gaza, where the offensive has focused, returned to the streets. Entire city blocks in and around Gaza City have been gutted by airstrikes that hollowed out buildings and left drifts of rubble. In southern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people from the north have sought refuge, residents lined up outside gas stations, hoping to stock up on fuel. Palestinians who have tried to return to the north to see if their homes are intact have been turned back by Israeli troops. “Many are desperate to return to their homes, but they open fire on anyone approaching from the south,” said Rami Hazarein, who fled from Gaza City last month. The Israeli military has ordered Palestinians not to return to the north or approach within a kilometer (around a half-mile) of the border fence. The Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service said that Israeli forces opened fire Sunday on two farmers in central Gaza, killing one and wounding the other. It didn’t provide further details. An Israeli military spokesperson said they weren’t aware of the incident. The United Nations said the truce has made it possible to scale up the delivery of food, water, and medicine to the largest volume since the start of the war, though it still hasn’t reached prewar levels. It was able to deliver fuel for the first time since the war began, and to reach areas in the north for the first time in a month. HOSTAGES FOR PRISONERS The freed hostages have mostly stayed out of the public eye. Hospitals said their physical condition has been good, aside from one who was shot during the attack and required surgery. Little is publicly known about the conditions of their captivity. Eyal Nouri, the nephew of Adina Moshe, 72, who was freed on Friday, said his aunt “had to adjust to the sunlight” because she had been in complete darkness for weeks. The released Palestinians included at least two women who had been given long sentences after being convicted by Israeli courts of violent attacks. Many Palestinians view prisoners held by Israel, including those implicated in attacks, as heroes resisting occupation, and have celebrated their release. The war in Gaza has been accompanied by a surge in violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Palestinian health authorities said Sunday that five Palestinians were killed in an Israeli military raid in the northern West Bank city of Jenin that began the day before. The toll in the West Bank is now 239 since the war began. The Israeli army has conducted frequent military raids and arrested hundreds of Palestinians since the start of the war, mostly people it suspects of being Hamas members.

The Israeli President’s Office confirmed the meeting between Tesla owner Elon Musk and Herzog.  \n             Herzog said that he would be joined in the meeting by some family members of hostages who are being held in Gaza, as reported by The Times of Israel. He further said that he will “emphasise the need to act to combat rising antisemitism online.” Musk, however, has recently come under fire for his endorsements of a virulently antisemitic trope on X, as well as the platform’s complete failure to crack down on rampant disinformation and hate speech amid the ongoing war, The Times of Israel reported. The failure to combat antisemitism on the app and comments viewed as anti-Semitic, shared by Musk himself resulted in several advertisers like Apple and Disney cutting off their spending on the microblogging site. \n             \n           Amid the row over endorsing ‘anti-semitic’ post on X, the platform owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said that the social media platform will file a “thermonuclear lawsuit” against the media watchdog ‘Media Matters’ alleging that it “completely misrepresented the real user experience” and “undermined free speech”. Musk is currently in Israel and is also expected to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his visit. Earlier this week, Musk announced that X would be donating all revenue from advertising and subscriptions “associated with the war in Gaza” to hospitals in Israel and the Red Cross/Crescent in Gaza. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Musk wrote, “We will track how funds are spent and go through Red Cross/Crescent. Better ideas are welcome. We should care about the innocent regardless of race, creed, religion or anything else.”",

        "text": "Israel-Hamas War: ‘Won’t Stop Until..,’ Pledges US President   \n         Washinton DC:  Amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas militants, United States President Joe Biden has pledged to ensure the safe return of every hostage to their loved ones. Notably, Biden made this commitment following the release of 13 hostages in Israel. While addressing a press conference in Washington, D.C., Biden also highlighted that the release of the 13 hostages, including an American citizen, was a result of extensive and thorough U.S. diplomacy. ‘We will not stop working until every hostage is returned to their loved ones. This has been the product of a lot of hard work and weeks of personal engagement for me and my team,’ he said.  \n             Notably, the hostages were released under a fragile four-day ceasefire and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas which is going to end today, November 27. So far two have occurred in which Hamas has released 41 hostages and Israel has freed 78 Palestinian prisoners. There are chance of a third swap before the deadline. President Biden further underlined that he is in constant touch with other West Asia countries regarding the matter, adding that the First Lady and ‘many Americans are praying’ that the 4-year-old Israeli-American Avigail Idan will be all right after she was released earlier on Sunday. “We have been in close contact with the leaders of Qatar, Egypt, and Israel, speaking with each one of them repeatedly over the past few weeks,” he added. \n             \n           The 4-year-old saw her mother killed in front of her on October 7 in Kibbutz Be’eri when the Hamas militants infiltrated  the country and started killing innocent civilians. The girl saw the militants shooting her mother. She ran to her father who shielded her with his body while shot him dead. She then ran to her neighbour’s home, where she, along with those inside, was taken hostage in Gaza. “What she endured is unthinkable,” Biden emphasised, noting that she celebrated her 4th birthday on Friday in captivity and that he had personally pressed for her release in a recent call with the emir of Qatar. During the press conference the US president expressed hope that the agreement between Israel and Hamas will be extended so more hostages can be released. “Israel has agreed to extend the four-day truce by an additional day for every extra 10 Israeli hostages released,” he added. Additionally, President Biden mentioned that he has been advocating for a pause for weeks to facilitate the safe release of hostages from Gaza and to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. He reported that approximately 200 trucks of aid have entered Gaza during the last three days of the truce. “Innocent children in Gaza are suffering greatly as well because of this war that Hamas has unleashed,” leading to the deaths of thousands of civilians, Biden noted. “I get a sense that all the players in the region… are looking for a way to end this so the hostages are all released and (that) Hamas is…no longer in control any portion of Gaza,” Biden said. Following the release of the hostages, hundreds of Israelis were observed cheering in Ofakim as the convoy proceeded to Hatzerim Airbase near Beersheba, as reported by The Times of Israel. The Israel Defence Forces noted that the Red Cross delivered 13 hostages near the border fence in northern Gaza. One of them was airlifted to a hospital, while the remaining 12 were transported in a convoy to the Hatzerim airbase.",

        "text": "Palestinian Students Shot In US (Photo_Reuters)   \n         New Delhi:  The  Israel Palestine Conflict  has been in the news and a huge topic of discussion as the two nations have been at war for almost two months since October 7 when the Palestinian Islamist organisation  Hamas  fired 5000 rockets from  Gaza  on Israel, declaring a full-fledged war. Amid the rising death toll and destruction from the war, three Palestinian college students have been shot in the United States by a ‘white man with a handgun’. The incident took place in Vermont and now the famliesof the victims have demanded hate crime probe in the matter. Know all about it..  \n             Palestinian Students Shot In US As mentioned earlier, three Palestinian college students were shot in Burlington City, Vermont, US on Saturday evening, as reported by CNN. According to information, the students were walking on Prospect Street after visiting a relative in Burlington for the Thanksgiving holiday when “they were confronted by a white man with a handgun.” The police said in its release, “Two are stable, while one has sustained much more serious injuries.” Victims Taken To University Of Vermont Medical Center For Medical Care The victims, two of whom are US citizens and one a legal resident, were taken to the University of Vermont Medical Center for medical care, according to a statement issued by the police on Sunday, as reported by CNN. Notably, two of the students were wearing keffiyehs, traditional Palestinian scarves, they added. According to CNN, two students sustained injuries to the torso, while the third suffered injuries to the “lower extremities.” “Without speaking, he discharged at least four rounds from the pistol and is believed to have fled on foot,” police said. Meanwhile, the Institute for Middle East Understanding issued a statement and identified the victims as Hisham Awartani, a student at Brown University in Rhode Island; Kinnan Abdalhamid, a student at Haverford College in Pennsylvania; and Tahseen Ahmad, a student at Trinity College in Connecticut, CNN reported. \n             \n           Police Investigates, Victims’ Kin Demands Hate Crime Probe Authorities said that “there is no additional information to suggest the suspect’s motive.” Moreover, detectives recovered ballistic evidence from the shooting, which will be submitted to a federal database, according to Burlington police. Reportedly, the FBI on Sunday said that it was “prepared to investigate” the incident. According to CNN, the shooter or shooters have not been identified or apprehended yet and the police department is “at the earliest stages of investigating this crime.” In a joint statement, the victims’ families urged law enforcement to investigate the attack as a hate crime. “We will not be comfortable until the shooter is brought to justice,” they said. “No family should ever have to endure this pain and agony. Our children are dedicated students who deserve to be able to focus on their studies and building their futures,” they added. The incident comes amid the increased tensions and hate crimes in the US in the past few weeks since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, to which Israel retaliated with airstrikes across the Gaza Strip. Earlier in October, a 6-year-old Palestinian-American boy was stabbed to death by his family’s landlord in a case, however, the authorities called it a hate crime, according to CNN.

        "text": "Qatar successfully negotiated an agreement between Israel and Hamas to extend the four-day truce between them by an additional two days, Doha's foreign ministry spokesperson said.   \n         Tel Aviv:  A truce deal to halt the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas has been extended by two more days amid international pressure to avoid a fierce battle that claimed hundreds of lives and left more injured in the past 45 days. Palestine-based terror group Hamas has also confirmed the two-day extension of the deal when the initial four-day agreement was set to expire on Tuesday.  \n             In the meantime, Qatar also announced that as part of the ongoing mediation, an agreement has been reached to extend the humanitarian truce for an additional two days in the Gaza Strip, Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al Ansari said on X. After taking stock of the situation, US President Joe Biden welcomed the additional two-day truce between Israel and Hamas after Qatar’s successful mediation, as reported by The Times of Israel. Biden issued a statement, welcoming the extended truce. “I have remained deeply engaged over the last few days to ensure that this deal–brokered and sustained through extensive US mediation and diplomacy–can continue to deliver results,” the US President said. \n             \n           As Hamas released 11 more hostages on the fourth day of the truce, Biden said, “Thus far, more than 50 hostages have now been released and returned to their families. Those released include young children, mothers, and grandmothers.” He restated the plight of Avigail Idan, a four-year-old Israeli-American who was released yesterday. According to The Times of Israel, her parents were murdered in front of her on October 7, before Idan was taken hostage. Biden further said, “I spoke with Abigail’s family following her release, and we are working closely with our Israeli partners to ensure she gets the care and support she needs as she begins to recover from this unspeakable trauma.” Moreover, he highlighted the additional humanitarian assistance, and noted, “The humanitarian pause has also enabled a significant surge in additional humanitarian assistance to the innocent civilians who are suffering across the Gaza strip.” Further, Biden stressed that no other country has donated more in humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians than the US, The Times of Israel reported. “We are taking full advantage of the pause in fighting to increase the amount of humanitarian aid moving into Gaza and we will continue our efforts to build a future of peace and dignity for the Palestinian people,” Biden said. He further thanked the leaders of Israel, Qatar, and Egypt for their cooperation and pledged to continue the fight until all hostages in Gaza are released, according to The Times of Israel. Earlier on Monday, Qatar successfully negotiated an agreement between Israel and Hamas to extend the four-day truce between them by an additional two days, Doha’s foreign ministry spokesperson said. “The State of Qatar announces, as part of the ongoing mediation, an agreement has been reached to extend the humanitarian truce for an additional two days in the Gaza Strip,” posted spokesperson Majed Al Ansari on X. This means at least ten more Israeli hostages will be released on Tuesday and that another ten will be released on Wednesday, with 30 Palestinian prisoners to be freed by Israel on each day as well, as reported by The Times of Israel. However, there is no immediate Israeli confirmation of the truce extension but Hamas issued its own statement confirming as much, crediting the Qatari and Egyptian mediation efforts, it added.",

        "description": "The sides agreed to extend their truce through Wednesday, with another two planned exchanges of militant-held hostages for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.",
        "text": "This undated photo released by Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters shows twin sisters, Emma Aloni Cunio and Yuli Aloni Cunio, 3 years-old, released Monday, Nov. 27, 2023, to Israel after 52 days in Hamas captivity. (Hostages and Missing Families Forum headquarters via AP)   \n         TEL AVIV, Israel:  A fragile truce between Israel and Hamas entered its fifth day on Tuesday, with the militant group promising to release more hostages to delay the expected resumption of the war and Israel under growing pressure to spare Palestinian civilians when it renews its offensive. For the first time since the cease-fire began, Israel and Hamas traded accusations of a serious violation. The Israeli military said three explosive devices were detonated near its troops at two locations in northern Gaza, and that militants at one site opened fire on the troops, who fired back. It said its troops were in positions in accordance with the terms of the truce.  \n             Hamas, in turn, accused Israel of committing a “blatant breach of the ceasefire,” triggering retaliation by its fighters, without providing details. It said in a statement that it “was still committed to the cease-fire so long as the enemy is committed to it,” and urged mediators to intervene. It was not immediately clear if the exchange posed a threat to the truce. But it underscored the fragility of the truce in northern Gaza, where Israeli forces and Hamas fighters are holding their positions in close proximity to each other, each preparing for a potential resumption of fighting when the cease-fire ends. The sides agreed to extend their truce through Wednesday, with another two planned exchanges of militant-held hostages for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. But Israel has vowed to resume the war with “full force” to destroy Hamas once it’s clear that no more hostages will be freed under the deal. \n             \n           The Biden administration has told Israel it must avoid “significant further displacement” and mass casualties among Palestinian civilians if it resumes the offensive, and that it must operate with more precision in southern Gaza than it has in the north, according to U.S. officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House. CIA director William Burns and David Barnea, who heads Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, were in Qatar, a key mediator with Hamas, to discuss extending the cease-fire and releasing more hostages, a diplomat said on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks. A U.S. official confirmed Burns was in Qatar, speaking anonymously because the director’s travel plans are not publicized for security reasons. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to visit the region this week, also with an eye to extending the truce. Hamas and other militants are still holding about 160 people, out of the 240 seized in their Oct. 7 assault into southern Israel that ignited the war. That’s enough to potentially extend the truce for another two weeks under the existing framework brokered by the Qatar, Egypt and the U.S., but Hamas is expected to make much higher demands for the release of captive soldiers. Israel has vowed to end Hamas’ 16-year rule in Gaza and crush its military capabilities. That would almost certainly require expanding the ground offensive from northern Gaza — where entire residential areas have been pounded into rubble — to the south, where hundreds of thousands of displaced people have packed into overflowing United Nations shelters. Israel blames the soaring casualty toll on Hamas, accusing the militants of using civilians as human shields while operating in dense, residential areas. HOSTAGES AND PRISONERS RELEASED Monday’s release brought to 50 the number of Israelis freed under the terms of the initial four-day truce. An additional 19 hostages were released in separate negotiations, including 17 Thais, one Filipino and one Russian-Israeli. So far, 150 Palestinians have been released from Israeli prisons. Israel has said it would extend the cease-fire by one day for every 10 additional hostages released. The Palestinian prisoners released so far have been mostly teenagers accused of throwing stones and firebombs during confrontations with Israeli forces. Some were convicted by Israeli courts of attempting to carry out deadly attacks. The prisoners are widely seen by Palestinians as heroes resisting occupation. Most of the freed hostages appeared to be physically well, but an 84-year-old woman released Sunday was hospitalized in critical condition because she had not had access to her medication in captivity. They have mostly stayed out of the public eye, but details of their captivity have started to emerge. In one of the first interviews with a freed hostage, 78-year-old Ruti Munder told Israel’s Channel 13 television that she was initially fed well in captivity but that conditions worsened as shortages took hold. She said she was kept in a “suffocating” room and slept on plastic chairs with a sheet for nearly 50 days. Israel imposed a siege on Gaza at the start of the war and had only allowed a trickle of humanitarian aid to enter prior to the cease-fire, leading to widespread shortages of food, water, medicine and fuel to power generators amid a territory-wide power blackout. NORTHERN GAZA IN RUINS The cease-fire has allowed residents who remained in Gaza City and other parts of the north to venture out to survey the destruction and try to locate and bury relatives. Footage from northern Gaza, the focus of the Israeli ground offensive, shows nearly every building damaged or destroyed. A U.N.-led aid consortium estimates that over 234,000 homes have been damaged across Gaza and 46,000 have been completely destroyed, amounting to around 60% of the housing stock in the territory, which is home to some 2.3 million Palestinians. In the north, the destruction of homes and civilian infrastructure “severely compromises the ability to meet basic requirements to sustain life,” it said. More than 13,300 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, roughly two-thirds of them women and minors, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. More than 1,200 people have been killed on the Israeli side, mostly civilians killed in the initial attack. At least 77 soldiers have been killed in Israel’s ground offensive. Israel says it has killed thousands of militants, without providing evidence. FEARS FOR THE SOUTH Israel’s bombardment and ground offensive have displaced more than 1.8 million people, nearly 80% of Gaza’s population, with most having sought refuge in the south, according to the U.N. humanitarian affairs office. Israeli troops have barred people from returning to the north during the cease-fire. Hundreds of thousands of people have packed into U.N.-run schools and other facilities, with many forced to sleep on the streets outside because of overcrowding. It’s unclear where they would go if Israel expands its ground operation, as Egypt has refused to accept refugees and Israel has sealed its border. The U.N. says the truce made it possible to scale up the delivery of food, water and medicine to the largest volume since the start of the war, and to bring in desperately needed fuel for homes, hospitals and water treatment plants. But the 160 to 200 trucks a day is still less than half what Gaza was importing before the fighting, even as humanitarian needs have soared. Four days into the truce, residents were still waiting for hours to buy gas and cooking fuel. Juliette Toma, a spokesperson for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, said people come to shelters asking for heavy clothes, mattresses and blankets, and that some are sleeping in damaged vehicles. “The needs are overwhelming,” she told The Associated Press. “They lost everything, and they need everything.” (Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "text": "Family welcomes released Palestinian Prisoner (Reuters)   \n         New Delhi:  Israel and Palestine are two nations who have been in the news for a couple of months now and the reason is not very pleasant. The decades-long  Israel Palestine Conflict  turned into an  Israel Hamas War  when the latter fired 5000 rockets from the  Gaza Strip  on Israel, on  October 7, 2023 . Since then, there have been constant attacks from both sides resulting in mass destruction and loss of life. Thousands of civilians on both sides have been killed while several are held hostage; children have lost their families and the people have been scarred for life. Amid the war that has been going on for almost two months, for the first time there has been a  temporary ceasefire  and people held hostages are being ‘returned’. After an initial decision of a four-day truce, the ceasefire has been extended by two days and on the fifth day,  30 Palestinians have been released  by Israeli Prison.  \n             30 Palestinians Released By Israeli Prison As a part of an extended truce deal, on the fifth day, the Israel Prison released 30 Palestinian prisoners on Tuesday, reported The Times of Israel. The Israel Prisons Service confirmed that it facilitated the release of 30 Palestinian inmates as part of the deal to free Israeli hostages in Gaza. Moreover, according to Qatar, the list includes 15 women and 15 minors, The Times of Israel reported. Hamas Released 12 Hostages Including 2 Foreign Nationals Earlier today, Hamas released 12 more hostages, including two foreign nationals, on the first day of the extended truce between Israel and Hamas, as reported by the Jerusalem Post. The hostages mainly include the elderly and certain family members. Moreover, to date, 60 female and child hostages have been released from Gaza. Under a separate agreement, one Filipino and 25 Thai citizens have been released, as has one Israeli who also holds Russian citizenship, according to the Jerusalem Post. Last month, four women were also freed, two of whom were Americans and another two Israelis. Israel Hamas Truce: Deal Between Nations As part of the deal, Israel has halted aerial surveillance above the enclave for some six hours daily to allow Hamas to locate all the hostages, which are held in separate locations, the Jerusalem Post reported. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that his country is committed to ensuring the return of all hostages, the elimination of Hamas and the promise that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israeli citizens. “We are committed to continuing our mission: the return of all our abductees, the elimination of Hamas above and below ground, and the promise that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to the citizens of Israel,” the Israeli PM posted on his official ‘X’ handle. \n             \n           (Inputs from ANI)",

        "description": "The release was expected to be followed by the swap of 10 more hostages in Gaza for 30 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.",
        "text": "Faith leaders from the Druze, Muslim, Jewish and Christian communities hold an interfaith prayer at Kibbutz Kfar Azza near the Israel-Gaza border, the site of an Oct. 7 cross-border attack by Hamas that killed some 1,200 people, Wednesday, Nov. 29, 2023. (AP Photo/Maya Alleruzzo)   \n         DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip:  International mediators on Wednesday worked to extend the truce in Gaza, encouraging Hamas militants to keep freeing hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and further relief from Israel’s air and ground offensive. The cease-fire will otherwise end within a day. Two Russian-Israeli women freed by Hamas entered Israel Wednesday evening, the military said. The release was expected to be followed by the swap of 10 more hostages in Gaza for 30 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.  \n             Israel has welcomed the release of dozens of hostages in recent days and says it will maintain the truce if Hamas keeps freeing captives. Still, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu underscored on Wednesday that Israel will resume its campaign to eliminate Hamas, which has ruled Gaza for 16 years and orchestrated the deadly attack on Israel that triggered the war “After this phase of returning our abductees is exhausted, will Israel return to fighting? So my answer is an unequivocal yes,” he said. “There is no way we are not going back to fighting until the end.” He spoke ahead of a visit to the region planned this week by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to press for further extensions of the truce and hostage releases. \n             \n           In the West Bank, Israeli troops killed two Palestinian boys — an 8-year-old an a 15-year-old — during a raid on the town of Jenin, Palestinian health officials said. Security footage showed a group of boys in the street who start to run, except for one who falls to the ground, bleeding. The Israeli military said its troops fired on people who threw explosives at them, but did not specify it was referring to the boys, who are not seen throwing anything. Separately, the military said its troops killed two Islamic Jihad militants during the raid. Weeks of heavy bombardment and a ground invasion demolished vast swaths of Gaza and killed thousands of Palestinians. But it seems to have had little effect on Hamas’ rule, evidenced by its ability to conduct complex negotiations, enforce the cease-fire among other armed groups, and orchestrate the release of hostages. Hamas leaders, including Yehya Sinwar, have likely relocated to the south. Most of Gaza’s 2.3 million people are now crammed into southern Gaza, with some three-quarters of them driven from their homes. The truce has led to a frenzied rush to obtain supplies to feed their families as aid enters in greater, but still insufficient, amounts. Hanging over everyone is the fear that fighting will soon resume. An Israeli ground invasion of the south will likely bring an escalating cost in Palestinian lives and destruction that the United States, Israel’s main ally, could be unwilling to bear. The Biden administration has told Israel that if it launches an offensive in the south, it must operate with far greater precision. “How far both sides will be prepared to go in trading hostages and prisoners for the pause is about to be tested, but the pressures and incentives for both to stick with it are at the moment stronger than the incentives to go back to war,” Martin Indyk, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel, wrote on X. DIPLOMACY RAMPS UP The cease-fire is due to end at some point after Wednesday’s exchange. Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt’s state information services, said negotiations have made progress and that it is “highly likely” an extension will be announced Wednesday. Egypt, Qatar and the U.S. have led mediation in the original cease-fire and a two-day extension announced Monday. The war began with Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel, in which it killed over 1,200 people, mostly civilians. The militants kidnapped some 240 people back into Gaza, including babies, children, women, soldiers, older adults and Thai farm laborers. Israel’s bombing campaign and ground invasion in Gaza have killed more than 13,300 Palestinians, roughly two-thirds of them women and minors, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. The toll is likely much higher, as officials have only sporadically updated the count since Nov. 11 due to the breakdown of services in the north. The ministry says thousands more people are missing and feared dead under the rubble. Israel says 77 of its soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive. It claims to have killed thousands of militants, without providing evidence. ISRAEL’S HOSTAGE DILEMMA The plight of the captives and shock from the Oct. 7 attack, have galvanized Israeli support for the war. But Netanyahu is also under pressure to bring the hostages home and could find it difficult to resume the offensive if there’s a prospect for more releases. Before Wednesday’s hostage releases, Israel said around 160 hostages were still being held in Gaza — 126 men and 35 women; four under the age of 18, and 10 over the age of 75. Each side so far has been releasing women and children for the swaps. An Israeli official involved in hostage negotiations said efforts were focused on a two-day truce extension for the release of all remaining women and children held by Hamas. Until that happens, a further extension for release of civilian males and soldiers would not be considered, he said. He estimated that there are “several dozen” soldiers in Hamas captivity, most of them males. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because negotiations were ongoing. For men — and especially soldiers — Hamas is expected to push for comparable releases of Palestinian men or prominent detainees, a deal Israel may resist. A total of 63 Israelis, including dual nationals, have been freed during the six-day truce, most of whom appear physically well but shaken. Another 20 hostages — 19 Thais and one Filipino — have also been released. Before the cease-fire, Hamas released four hostages, and the Israeli army rescued one. Two others were found dead in Gaza. So far, most of the 180 Palestinians freed from Israeli prisons have been teenagers accused of throwing stones and firebombs during confrontations with Israeli forces. Several were women convicted by Israeli military courts of attempting to attack soldiers. Palestinians have celebrated the release of people they see as having resisted Israel’s decades-long military occupation of lands they want for a future state. TENSE CALM IN GAZA For Palestinians in Gaza, the truce’s calm has been overwhelmed by the search for aid and by horror as they see the extent of destruction. In the north, residents described entire residential blocks leveled to the ground in Gaza City and surrounding areas. The smell of decomposing bodies trapped under collapsed buildings fills the air, said Mohmmed Mattar, a 29-year-old resident of Gaza City who along with other volunteers searches for the dead under rubble or left in the streets. They have found and buried 46 so far during the truce, he said. Most were unidentified. More bodies remain inside rubble but can’t be reached without heavy equipment, or are left on streets that are unapproachable because of Israeli troops nearby, Mattar said. In the south, the truce has allowed more aid to be delivered from Egypt, up to 200 trucks a day. But aid officials say it is not enough, given that most now depend on outside aid. Overwhelmed U.N.-run shelters house more than 1 million displaced people, with many sleeping outside in cold, rainy weather. At a distribution center in Rafah, large crowds line daily up for newly arrived bags of flour. But supplies run out quickly before many can get their share. “We’ve been searching for bread for our children,” said one woman in line, Nawal Abu Namous. “Every day, we come here … we spend money on transportation to get here, just to go home with nothing.” Some markets and shops have reopened, but prices for the few items in stock have skyrocketed. Winter clothes are unavailable. One clothes shop owner in Deir al-Balah told The Associated Press that he hates opening his doors in the morning, knowing he’ll spend most of the day apologizing to customers for not having winter items. The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said some 111,000 people have respiratory infections and 75,000 have diarrhea, more than half of them under 5 years old. “More people could die from disease than bombings.” “We are fed up,” said Omar al-Darawi, who works at the overwhelmed Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in central Gaza. “We want this war to stop.” (Jeffery reported from Cairo and Lidman from Jerusalem.)",

        "text": "The hostages will be brought to a meeting point where Israeli forces will verify their identities before escorting them into Israel via a side gate at the Kerem Shalom crossing.   \n         Tel Aviv : After the Gaza truce was extended by two more days, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) on Monday confirmed the release of over 14 hostages, including 10 Israelis and four Thai nationals, from Hamas captivity, as reported by The Times of Israel.  \n             On the other hand, Hamas said as part of the Israel-Hamas extended truce deal, it has released these 14 hostages, who have been transferred by the Red Cross from the Gaza Strip to Egypt via the Rafah crossing. Earlier, Hamas released two dual Russian-Israeli citizens, Yelena Trupanov and her mother, Irena Tati, as part of a gesture to Russian President Vladimir Putin, unrelated to the truce deal with Israel, according to The Times of Israel. The mother and daughter were then brought to Sheba Medical Centre following their return to Israel. \n             \n           Moreover, according to The Times of Israel, the 10 Israeli hostages released were identified as Raz Ben Ami, Yarden Roman, Liat Atzili, Moran Stela Yanai, Liam Or, Itay Regev, Ofir Engel, Amit Shani, Gali Tarshansky and Raaya Rotem. Moreover, the hostages will be brought to a meeting point where Israeli forces will verify their identities before escorting them into Israel via a side gate at the Kerem Shalom crossing. Meanwhile, the IDF said, “The families of the hostages are being updated by IDF representatives with the latest available information.” Excluding today’s release of hostages, 50 were released between Friday and Monday, while 10 others were freed on Tuesday night. According to the initial truce agreement, Israel agreed to halt its military operations in Gaza for four days and emphasised that it would release three Palestinian security prisoners for each of the 50 hostages freed from Gaza, The Times of Israel reported. Notably, Israel President Isaac Herzog is set to attend the COP28 climate conference in Dubai later this week to hold sideline meetings with global leaders, in order to get the remaining hostages released from Gaza, his office said. “The purpose of these meetings is to reveal to world leaders in a clear and profound manner the atrocities committed by the Hamas terror organization during the horrific massacre on October 7 and to emphasize the essential security threat that led to Israel’s forced entry into the war,” Herzog’s office said. Furthermore, Herzog will also use the meetings to highlight the steps Israel is taking to mitigate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza as it continues its war against Hamas once the truce concludes, The Times of Israel reported.

        "description": "Henry Kissinger, Former US Secretary of State, has died at the age of 100.",
        "text": "Washington:  Henry Kissinger, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and diplomatic powerhouse whose service under two presidents left an indelible mark on US foreign policy, died on Wednesday (Nov 29). News of his death was confirmed by a statement from his consulting firm. The former US diplomat celebrated his 100th birthday in May 2023 and continued to remain active in his 100th year.  \n             Kissinger served as secretary of state and national security adviser under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and remained a prominent voice on foreign policy issues long after leaving government in 1977. He had been active past his centenary, attending meetings in the White House, publishing a book on leadership styles, and testifying before a Senate committee about the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. In July 2023 he made a surprise visit to Beijing to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. Who was Henry Kissinger Henry Kissinger was a Jewish refugee who fled Nazi Germany with his family in 1938. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1943, he served in the U.S. Army for three years, returning to Europe to fight in World War II and receiving a Bronze Star in 1945. Kissinger then earned bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees from Harvard, where he held a faculty appointment from 1954 to 1969. \n             \n           Kissinger served as a consultant to government agencies, including in 1967 when he acted as an intermediary for the State Department in Vietnam. The former US SOS played a crucial role in negotiations with China, the Yom Kippur War in the Middle East and was hailed for his contributions to ending America’s role in the Vietnam War. Kissinger also won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973 for his role towards implementing a ceasefire in Vietnam after the signing of the Paris Peace Accords in January 1973. Dr. Kissinger is survived by his wife of nearly 50 years, Nancy Maginnes Kissinger, two children by his first marriage, David and Elizabeth, and five grandchildren. Kissinger declared in 1972 that “peace is at hand” in Vietnam but the Paris Peace Accords reached in January 1973 were little more than a prelude to the final Communist takeover of the South two years later. In 1973, in addition to his role as national security adviser, Kissinger was named secretary of state – giving him unchallenged authority in foreign affairs. An intensifying Arab-Israeli conflict launched Kissinger on his first so-called “shuttle” mission, a brand of highly personal, high-pressure diplomacy for which he became famous. Kissinger’s reign as the prime architect of US foreign policy waned with Nixon’s resignation in 1974. Still, he continued to be a diplomatic force under President Gerald Ford and to offer strong opinions throughout the rest of his life. In 1957, he published a book, Nuclear War and Foreign Policy – that said a limited atomic war was winnable. Couched in anti-sceptic language, he claimed that “tactical” and “strategic” use of a new breed of smaller missile might be rational. He became a powerful critic of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton’s foreign policy, arguing the presidents wanted too fast a leap towards peace in the Middle East. For Kissinger, that could happen only inch-by-inch. After 9/11, George W Bush asked him to chair the investigation into the attacks on New York and Washington, but he was forced to stand down within weeks – after refusing to reveal his consultancy’s list of clients and answer questions about conflicts of interest. He held meetings with President Bush and Vice-President Dick Cheney, to advise them over policy in Iraq following the 2003 invasion. “Victory over the insurgency,” he told them, “is the only exit strategy.” Always influential, he briefed Donald Trump on foreign affairs after his election in 2017 – suggesting, among other things, acceptance of Vladimir Putin’s occupation of Crimea. Though, by the time that he reached the age of 100 in 2023, he had changed his view on Ukraine. After the Russian invasion, he argued that President Zelensky’s country should join Nato after peace was secured.",

        "text": "Representative Image (Photo Credit - AP)   \n         New Delhi:  The ongoing  Israel Hamas War  is going to complete two months and the destruction caused by this war is irreparable and has scarred the people of the two countries for life. Amid the raging war between  Israel and Palestine , a  terror attack  has been reported in  Jerusalem  where gunmen opened fire on civilians, killing three Israelis and injuring many others.

US Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew condemned the “abhorrent terrorist attack” in Jerusalem, calling it “brutal.” “My thoughts are with the families of the victims and I offer my sincere condolences to all those affected,” he posted on X. The finance minister of Israel Bezalel Smotrich has said that Israel is at “war on all fronts,” and will pursue and “destroy” terrorists everywhere”. The terrible attack in Jerusalem reminds us that our enemies are not only the Nazis in Gaza. We will pursue and destroy them, with God’s help, everywhere,” Smotrich wrote on X, saying Israel is going for “total victory on all fronts.” Gunmen ‘Netutralised’, Identities Not Yet Given Out Two off-duty soldiers and an armed civilian killed the assailants who opened fire, shortly after the attack. The attackers’ identities are not immediately given, but some Hebrew media reports say they are from East Jerusalem. Police said officers are scanning the area to rule out any additional attackers, reported The Times of Israel. The attacks come shortly after Hamas’ agreement with Israel to extend the ceasefire for a seventh day. \n             \n           The operation pause was set to end at 7 am (local time) on Thursday, The Times of Israel reported. According to the agreement, Hamas will need to release at least 10 hostages for every extra day of the pause in fighting. In turn, Israel will release 30 Palestinian prisoners for every 10 hostages. Taking to X, the IDF stated, “The operational pause will continue in light of the mediators’ efforts to continue the process of releasing the hostages and subject to the terms of the framework.” (Inputs from ANI)",

        "text": "Israel Hamas War (Photo Credit - Reuters)   \n         New Delhi:  The Israel Palestine Conflict turned into an Israel Hamas War when the latter fired 5000 rockets from the Gaza Strip on Israel, on October 7, 2023. Since then, there have been constant attacks from both sides killing thousands of civilians on both sides and several are held hostage; children have lost their families and the people have been scarred for life. Amid the war that has been going on for almost two months, for the first time there has been a temporary ceasefire and people held hostages are being ‘returned’. After an initial decision of a four-day truce, the ceasefire was extended by two days and now the truce has been extended to a seventh day. Know all about it..  \n             Israel Hamas War: Truce Extended To Seventh Day Just moments before the scheduled expiration of the temporary truce between Israel and Hamas at 7 am local time on Thursday, the Israeli military officially announced a one-day extension, CNN reported. This extension comes as negotiations for additional hostage releases continue. Both Hamas and Qatar have confirmed the prolongation of the truce. Leading up to the deadline, negotiators, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, engaged in discussions in Qatar about the potential extension. However, as the truce was about to expire, Hamas reported an impasse in negotiations, alleging that Israel rejected an offer to extend the truce in exchange for the release of seven detained women and children, as well as the bodies of three deceased individuals–allegedly killed by Israeli bombardment, as reported by CNN. In anticipation of the truce deadline, Hamas instructed its military wing to be prepared for combat, while Israel’s military had previously stated its readiness for the next stage of the conflict. Qatar Played Role Of Mediator Qatar, playing a pivotal role in mediating the truce negotiations, confirmed the extension in a statement released on Thursday. “The Palestinian and Israeli sides had reached an agreement to extend the humanitarian truce in the Gaza Strip for an additional day,” Qatar’s foreign ministry said in its statement. The Ministry added that negotiations continue in hopes of reaching a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. Israel will extend the truce for each day that Hamas continues to release 10 “living” hostages, a senior Israeli official reiterated Thursday. \n             \n           (Inputs from ANI)",

This incident disrupted one of the House office buildings, leading to restricted public access to the complex. According to a Hill staffer, they were advised to use tunnels instead of the main entrance. “We have been advised by the police to use the tunnels and not the main entrance and exit doors,” ANI quoted a staffer. In the video shared by news agency ANI, the protesters, with members from Jewish groups, were seen holding placards that read, “Ceasefire”, “Jews say, Ceasefire now.” Following the protest, the House sergeant-at-arms sent out a memo to congressional offices that all visitors should be restricted to a single door in order to control the crowd from entering into the campus. On Tuesday night, as a precautionary measure in anticipation of the protest, multiple bike-rack fences were installed around the Capitol building. Within the building, numerous demonstrators chanted “ceasefire now” and were subsequently arrested by the Capitol Police throughout the afternoon. Additionally, the Capitol Police declared the closure of roads surrounding the Capitol to enhance the safety of the protestors outside. \n             \n           “A group of protesters are demonstrating inside the Cannon Rotunda. Demonstrations are not allowed inside Congressional Buildings,” the U.S. Capitol Police said in a post on X. “Demonstrations are not allowed inside Congressional Buildings,” the Capitol Police said after the arrests. “We warned the protestors to stop demonstrating and when they did not comply we began arresting them,” the Capitol Police added. Emphasising that the Hamas militants are committing a double war crime daily, Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu said, “Every day they perpetrate a double war crime, targetting our civilians while hiding behind their civilians, embedding themselves in the civilian population and using them as human shields. We have seen the cost of this terrible double war crime against humanity that Hamas has been perpetrating in the last 11 days.” He highlighted that due to the attacks civilians are unfortunately getting harmed, whereas IDF is targeting terrorists only. “Hamas is responsible and should be held accountable for all civilian casualties,” he added. According to the ministry as many as 3,478 people have been killed since Israel began bombing the Strip on October 7, in reaction to a Hamas onslaught in which some 1,400 Israelis were massacred.",

        "text": "Israels' IDF questioned claims by the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza that several people had been killed in the explosion.   \n         Tel Aviv:  Days after the explosion at the Gaza hospital that killed more than 500 people, Israel Defence Force (IDF) on Thursday refuted claims made by the Palestinian side that Israel was behind the bomb explosion at the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza.  \n             In a video briefing, IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus while reiterating the Israeli PM’s statement that the Islamic Jihad was behind the explosion at the Hospital said that the preliminary analysis suggests that the “rocket” exploded in the car parking and seems like no one was killed in the incident. While describing a video analysis, the IDF spokesperson said, “We can see that this area is quite black, this appears that there was a large fire. This is really the centre of where the rocket impacted, the impact point of the rocket. What I see here is about 15 cars that were affected by the rocket that fell, I see remains of fire, what I don’t see are bodies.” IDF also questioned claims by the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza that several people had been killed in the explosion. \n             \n           Where Are The Bodies?  “If five hundred people were indeed killed here or 471 which is the latest update from the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry in Gaza, this is just a few minutes after the fire erupted, where are all the bodies…, If so many people were killed, where are the bodies” said Lt. Col Conricus. In his analysis the IDF spokesperson stated that pictures clicked from the explosion site showed a huge fire, but when an Israeli bomb hits a target it makes a big crater and not a fire. “If you have been watching the news, this is exactly what a rocket impact cited Israel looks like, that’s what we see when a rocket impacts Israel. We don’t see Giant creators, because it’s not hundreds of pounds of bombs. We see fires, we see burnt cars and burnt stuff because when rocket lands usually they ignite a fire” the IDF stated. Biden Visits Israel Earlier, United States President Joe Biden, who arrived on Wednesday on an official visit to Tel Aviv, backed Israel’s claim that the explosion at the Al-Ahli Baptist hospital in Gaza seemed to have been carried out by the “other team” in reference to Gaza bases terror groups. He also asserted that the US will make sure that Israel would get what it requires to defend itself from Hamas’ attacks.”Americans are worried because we know there’s this is not an easy field to navigate what you have to do, but the fact is that Israel as they respond to these attacks, it seems to me that have to continue to ensure that you have what you need to defend yourselves. And we’re going to make sure that occurs as you know,” Biden said. Addressing a joint media briefing with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden said, “We have to also bear in mind that Hamas does not represent all the Palestinian people and it has brought them only suffering.”On Tuesday’s explosion at the Al-Ahli hospital, Biden said he was “deeply saddened” and “outraged” and emphasised that the preliminary data says that the explosion was a result of a rocket misfired by the Islamic Jihad. Biden Saddened, Outraged By The Explosion  President Biden added, “I was deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday and based on what I’ve seen, It appears as though it was done by the other team, not you, but there’s a lot of people out there, not sure so we got a lot of got to overcome a lot of things and also means encouraging lifesaving capacity to help the Palestinians were innocent caught in the middle of this.” Meanwhile, as the Israel-Hamas conflict entered the 13th day Israeli Air Force struck targets belonging to Hezbollah, along the Lebanon border. This the IDF said was in response to Wednesday’s shooting attacks. The targets struck include an observation point facing the sea, from which anti-tank missiles were fired at Rosh HaNikra.

And you need to wake up and understand that,” she added. “We are literally watching people commit genocide and killing a vast majority… and we still stand by and say nothing. We will remember this.” She blasted President Biden for his response to the Israel-Hamas war after a hospital in the war-torn Gaza Strip was hit by airstrikes that reportedly killed at least 500 Palestinians.

It has almost been two weeks and the war continues with full-fledged attacks from both sides, killing more than 3000 people in both the places and injuring more than 10,000. Thousands of families have been broken, children are ‘missing’, women and kids have been held hostage and the injured are not being given proper treatment due to loss of resources. The war has had a lasting effect on all the civilians in both the countries.. amid the  Israel-Hamas War , an Israeli woman exclusively shares her horrific experience about how there have been non-syop missile attacks on their homes, how they have been mourning and only seeing mourning around them and how despite all this, they are hopeful for a better future..  \n             ‘Almost Non-Stop Missiles Attacks On Our Homes Continue..’ The Israeli woman, who has requested to remain anonymous, shares her painful experience as she lives in her hometown, Tel Aviv during the raging war. She says, ‘As the days pass, our aching increases. Israel’s a tiny state, (the size of New Jersey) and every Israeli is mourning as we all closely know affected survivors and mourning families. We’re heart broken from horror testimonies fractionally told by traumatized new holocaust survives. The almost non-stop missile attacks on our homes are continuing.’ ‘As Long As There’s A Star In The Horizon, We Shall Overcome..’ Despite the raging war, non-stop attacks, acquaintances and city people being killed and terrorists opening fire, the people of Israel are ready to stick together and do all that they can, to help each other and stay united in the worst of the worst circumstances. She says, ‘We’re mourning with family and neighbors who are lucky to be able to bring their loved ones to rest and horrified with those who know that their loved ones are captured in the hands of the Evil with no mercy. Yet, EVERYONE is active in volunteering, in assisting, in repairing, in caring.’ \n             \n           Sharing a photograph of ‘hope’, the Israeli woman says, ‘As long as there’s a star in the horizon, we shall overcome.

She says that everyone is very tired but cannot sleep because of the missile attacks. In her words, “We’re so tired, exhausted, but can’t go to bed since there’s missiles attacking our homes again. Since we live on the 8th floor, we can’t get to the underground shelter on time, so our secure area is the main staircase.” This is from October 9, which was two days after the attacks began. How Was The Situation On The First Day Of War? The Israeli resident also narrated her ordeal on October 8, when she said that the dimensions of this shocking horror, perhaps the biggest terror attack in history, are unimaginable. Hundreds murdered and thousands injured, many in critical state. Searches are continuously going on, miles around the controversial Gaza Strip, for wounded survivors and bodies of those who have lost their lives. Dozens of hostages, mostly civilians of all ages. The resident of Tel Aviv, Israel had also said, “All through yesterday we heard the petrifying whispering calls from mothers and children hiding in locked shelter rooms, with terrorists in their homes trying to break in, and burning the houses around them. We heard courageous stories of survivors from the peace nature party who hid and scrolled for hours to safety while watching their friends shot around them. Many bravery stories will be never told, as the heroes aren’t with us any more.”",

        "text": "File Photo   \n         New Delhi:  Jemima Goldsmith, ex-wife of Imran Khan has claimed that the former Pakistan Prime Minister faced an assassination bid by radical Islamists because he is close to the Jews. Jemima, who is of Jewish origin and converted to Islam after her marriage to the Khan, also weighed in on the raging Israel-Palestine conflict stating that being a Jew and then marrying a Muslim gives her a unique perspective on the issue as she can relate to both sides of the narrative.  \n             Jemima said her children, born to a Jewish-origin mother and Muslim father, faced antisemitism in Pakistan and Islamophobia in the UK. “I have lived in a Muslim country for ten years and have been to Gaza & The West Bank and I also have a historic family connection to Israel. I have personally had (and continue to receive) countless death threats on account of my Jewishness & faced decades of antisemitic abuse,” Jemima wrote amid a public spat over the Israel-Hamas war with her brothers Ben Goldsmith and Zac Goldsmith. \n I realise that Twitter spats don’t help anyone. I have found it hard to disengage – I have Jewish and Muslim family members & friends, whom I deeply love. I have lived in a Muslim country for ten years and have been to Gaza & The West Bank and I also have a historic family… \n — Jemima Goldsmith (@Jemima_Khan)  October 18, 2023 \n             \n           While her brothers extended their support to Israel, Jemima presented an alternate narrative in which both sides have a valid claim in the ongoing conflict. Jemima said her former husband was targeted by Islamists because of his “proximity to the Jews” and even became the victim of an assassination attempt back in 2022. “The father of my children was shot, according to his would-be -assassin, because of his “proximity to the Jews” – ie. me. Meanwhile, my children have faced Islamophobia in the UK (& antisemitism in Pakistan!),” Jemima wrote. Jemima said she can relate to both narratives in the conflict as she has family on both sides of the fence. “I realise that Twitter spats don’t help anyone. I have found it hard to disengage – I have Jewish and Muslim family members & friends, whom I deeply love,” she said. “Perhaps because of these experiences, I passionately believe that political tribalism is the enemy, not just of reasonable discourse but of peace. It’s why I’m so in awe of the bravery & integrity of those Israelis who despite having lost relatives in the last few days, have made some of the most powerful statements against the ongoing bombing of Gaza. I pray their voices are heard.” “Killing and maiming thousands more innocent children will not save terrorised hostages, nor will it bring peace and, like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan post 9-11, will likely only create more terrorism and a less safe world for all of us,” Jemima said. \n   pic.twitter.com/9ZlsXKWWJ7 \n — Jemima Goldsmith (@Jemima_Khan)  October 16, 2023 A bloody was triggered between Israel and Hamas after the Gaza-based militant group fired over 5,000 rockets into the Jewish nation on October 7, killings hundreds, including civilians, as they stormed Israeli border towns in a suprise onslaught. Israel retaliated with a major offensive and has nearly bombed Gaza into oblivion in its bid to eliminate Hamas once and for all. On Tuesday, a hospital in war-torn Gaza strip was hit by a missile resulting in the deaths of hundreds of civilians, including women and children. The incident has drawn widespread condemnation even as Israel and Hamas have blamed each other for the blast. The Palestinian Health Ministry said that 471 people were killed and 314 others injured in the hospital blast for which Hamas and Israel traded charges holding each other responsible for the incident. Israel has blamed a misfired rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a claim rejected by the militant group.",

        "text": "File Photo   \n         New Delhi:  Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday conveyed condolences to President of Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas for the civilians deaths at a Gaza hospital which was hit by a missile, killing hundreds, including women and children, amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.  \n             According to an official statement, the Prime Minister reiterated India’s long-standing “principled position” on the Israel-Palestine issue and told the Palestine Authority President that New Delhi will continue to send humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people. In a phone conversation, PM Modi, at the same time, shared with Abbas India’s “deep concern” over terrorism, violence and deteriorating security situation in the region. “Spoke to the President of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas. Conveyed my condolences at the loss of civilian lives at the Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza,” PM Modi said on ‘X’. \n             \n           “We will continue to send humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people.

Around 500 people were reported to have been killed on Tuesday in an explosion on the al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza, triggering strong international condemnation. Palestinian authorities blamed Israeli air strikes for the explosion at the hospital while Israel said it was caused by a misfired rocket launched from Gaza by militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed shock at the loss of lives in the attack on the Gaza hospital and that those involved in civilian casualties in the ongoing conflict should be held responsible. “Deeply shocked at the tragic loss of lives at the Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza. Our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims, and prayers for speedy recovery of those injured,” Modi said on ‘X’ on Tuesday. “Civilian casualties in the ongoing conflict are a matter of serious and continuing concern. Those involved should be held responsible,” he said. India calls for strict observance of international humanitarian law Meanwhile, India has called for observance of international humanitarian law amid the raging Israel-Hamas which has resulted in deaths of thousands of civilians on both sides. Speaking amidst the backdrop of an attack on a hospital in Gaza strip which triggered global outrage, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said India is concerned over civilian casualties and the humanitarian situation. We would urge strict observance of international humanitarian law, he said at his weekly media briefing while replying to questions on the attack on the hospital this week. We have strongly condemned the horrific attack on Israel, Bagchi said, adding the international community must stand together in combating terrorism in all its forms. On the Palestine issue, he said India reiterated its position in favour of direct negotiations for a two-state solution. (With PTI inputs)",

        "description": "United States, Israel and Egypt have said vital aid for Gaza could begin to flow in the next few days.",
        "text": "Rafah Crossing: When Will Aid Enter Gaza, Why Has It Been Closed? | Reuters   \n         Tel Aviv:  Israel, the White House, and Egypt have agreed to let a small amount of help go into Gaza through the Rafah border with Egypt in the next few days. They might also allow people with foreign passports to leave through this border, as many have come here to leave recently. Meanwhile, Israel told people living in Gaza Strip to move southwards closer to Rafah to shelter from bombardment.  \n             Israel-Hamas War: What Is the Rafah Border Crossing? It is noteworthy that the Rafah crossing is the only connection between Gaza to Egypt and it is the sole route for aid to enter the conflicted part outside Israel. It is the only exit that does not lead to Israeli territory. The Rafah crossing has become very significant amid the intensifying conflict between Israel and Hamas militants. Several Palestinians have headed towards the southern strip after Israel Defence Forces warned them to leave Gaza City and the north. Israel-Hamas War:   How Long Until Aid Reaches Gaza? United States President Joe Biden agreed to open the crossing and pass the first group of trucks with humanitarian aid. If Hamas confiscates aid, “it will end”, he said. The President’s office informed us that the aid would start moving on Friday. \n             \n           The White House added that the first batch carries 20 trucks, but approx. 150 trucks with humanitarian aid will also be sent. Egypt says the roads across the border need to be repaired after they were hit by Israeli airstrikes. More than 200 trucks and 3,000 tonnes of aid are positioned at or near the Rafah crossing, according to the head of the Red Crescent for North Sinai, Khalid Zayed. Supplies would go in under the supervision of the UN, the Egyptian foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, told Al Arabiya TV. Asked if foreigners and dual nationals seeking to leave would be let through, he said, “As long as the crossing is operating normally and the [crossing] facility has been repaired.” Why Has Egypt Been Reluctant To Open The Border To Civilians? Egypt and Jordan border Israel and share boundaries with Gaza and the occupied West Bank, respectively. Both countries have been cautious about allowing displaced Palestinians to enter. Egypt’s President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi made a stern comment on Wednesday, saying that the conflict was not solely aimed at combating Hamas, which governs the conflicted Gaza Strip, but also an effort to compel civilian residents to migrate to Egypt. He cautioned that this could jeopardize peace in the region. Instead of relocating Palestinians to Egypt, Sisi proposed relocating them to the Negev Desert in Israel until the militants are dealt with. During a joint press conference in Cairo with the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, Sisi stated, “What is happening in Gaza now is an attempt to pressure civilian residents to seek refuge and migrate to Egypt, which should not be accepted.” In reference to Egypt’s stance, Hamas official Osama Hamdan called for solidarity and support for this position during a press conference in Beirut, emphasizing that it provides genuine protection for the Palestinian people at the popular and Arab official levels.",

        "description": "1,400 people in Israel have been killed since Hamas attacked on Oct. 7 — mostly civilians slain during the incursion that shattered Israelis sense of security and resulted in 203 hostages taken into Gaza.",
        "text": "A Palestinian woman mourns over the bodies of her relatives who were killed in Israeli airstrikes that hit a Greek Orthodox church, in Gaza City, Friday, Oct. 20, 2023. (AP Photo)   \n         KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (Palestine): Israel on Friday said it does not plan a long-term occupation of the Gaza Strip after it roots out Hamas militants who control the Palestinian territory. Israeli military continued its ruthless assault as it punished Gaza with airstrikes while it inches closer to a final ground offensive against the Hamas group in the war-torn land.  \n             On Friday, authorities inched closer to bringing aid to desperate families and hospitals while Muslims around the world protested in solidarity with Palestinians. Israel bombed areas in southern Gaza where Palestinians had been told to seek safety while it tries to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its brutal rampage in Israel two weeks ago. Fighting between Israel and militants in neighboring Lebanon also raged, prompting evacuations of Lebanese and Israeli border towns as fears of a widening conflict grew. ‘Three-stage plan’ Speaking to lawmakers about Israel’s long-term plans for Gaza, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant laid out a three-stage plan that seemed to suggest that Israel did not intend to reoccupy the territory it left in 2005. \n             \n           First, Israeli airstrikes and “maneuvering” — a presumed reference to a ground attack — would aim to root out Hamas. Next will come a lower intensity fight to defeat remaining pockets of resistance. And, finally, a new “security regime” will be created in Gaza along with “the removal of Israel’s responsibility for life in the Gaza Strip,” Gallant said. Gallant did not say who Israel expected to run Gaza if Hamas is toppled or what the new security regime would entail. Israel occupied Gaza from 1967 until 2005, when it pulled up settlements and withdrew soldiers. Two years later, Hamas took over. Some Israelis blame the withdrawal from Gaza for the sporadic violence that has persisted since then. Over 1,400 killed in Israel, fate of hostages uncertain More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed since Hamas attacked on Oct. 7 — mostly civilians slain during the incursion that shattered Israelis sense of security and resulted in 203 hostages taken into Gaza. The Health Ministry run by Hamas says more than 4,100 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began. That includes a disputed number of people who died in a hospital explosion earlier this week. \nThe humanitarian crisis worsened for Gaza’s 2.3 million civilians, as workers along its border with Egypt repaired the border crossing in a first step to bring aid to Palestinians running out of fuel, food, water and medicine. A million displaced, UN flags humanitarian crisis in Gaza Over a million people have been displaced in Gaza. Many heeded Israel’s orders to evacuate the northern part of the sealed-off enclave on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Although Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called areas in southern Gaza “safe zones” earlier this week, Israeli military spokesman Nir Dinar said Friday: “There are no safe zones.” U.N. officials said that with the bombings across all of Gaza, some Palestinians who had fled the north appeared to be going back. “The strikes, coupled with extremely difficult living conditions in the south, appear to have pushed some to return to the north, despite the continuing heavy bombing there,” Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the U.N. human rights office, said. Hospitals overwhelmed Gaza’s overwhelmed hospitals were rationing their dwindling resources, as authorities worked out logistics for a desperately needed aid delivery from Egypt. Generators in Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest, were operating at the lowest setting to conserve fuel while providing power to vital departments such as intensive care, hospital director Mohammed Abu Selmia said. Others worked in darkness. “I don’t know how long (the fuel) will last. Every day we evaluate the situation,” he said. The lack of medical supplies and water are making it difficult to treat the mass of victims from the Israeli strikes, he said. The deal to get aid into Gaza through the territory’s only entry point not controlled by Israel remained fragile. Israel said the supplies could only go to civilians and that it would “thwart” any diversions by Hamas. It was unclear if fuel for the hospital generators would be allowed to enter. Work continued Friday to repair the road at the Rafah border between Egypt and Gaza that had been damaged in airstrikes. Trucks unloaded gravel, and bulldozers and other equipment was used to fill in large craters. A U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a rapidly changing situation said aid had been delayed because of ongoing road repairs, and that it was expected to move across the border Saturday. More than 200 trucks and some 3,000 tons of aid were positioned near the crossing. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited the crossing Friday and appealed for the quick movement of aid into Gaza, calling it “the difference between life and death.” War brews on Israel-Lebanon border Israel has evacuated its own communities near Gaza and Lebanon, putting residents up in hotels elsewhere in the country. The Defense Ministry announced evacuation plans Friday for Kiryat Shmona, a town of more than 20,000 residents near the Lebanese border. Three Israelis including a 5-year-old girl were wounded in a rocket attack there Thursday, according to Israeli health services. Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group, which has a massive arsenal of long-range rockets, has traded fire with Israel along the border on a near-daily basis and hinted it might join the war if Israel seeks to annihilate Hamas. Iran supports both armed groups. The violence in Gaza has also sparked protests across the region, including in Arab countries allied with the U.S. Palestinians in Gaza reported heavy airstrikes in Khan Younis, a town in the territory’s south, and ambulances carrying men, women and children streamed into the local Nasser Hospital. 16 killed as Israeli airstrike levels Gaza church Late Thursday, an Israeli airstrike hit a Greek Orthodox church in Gaza City housing displaced Palestinians. The military said it had targeted a Hamas command center nearby, causing damage to a church wall. Gaza’s Hamas-run Health Ministry said 16 Palestinian Christians were killed. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchy of Jerusalem condemned the attack and said it would “not abandon its religious and humanitarian duty” to provide assistance. Palestinian militants have launched unrelenting rocket attacks into Israel — more than 6,900 since Oct. 7, according to Israel — and tensions have flared in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel has targeted militants in raids across the occupied territory. On Friday, two Palestinian teenagers were killed in clashes in the West Bank, where more than 80 Palestinians have been killed over the past two weeks. An unclassified U.S. intelligence assessment estimated casualties in an explosion at a Gaza City hospital this week on the “low end” of 100 to 300 deaths. It said intelligence officials were still assessing the evidence and the casualty estimate may evolve. The report echoed earlier assessments by U.S. officials that the massive blast at the al-Ahli hospital was not caused by an Israeli airstrike, as Hamas has reported. Israel has presented video, audio and other evidence it says proves the blast was caused by a rocket misfired by Palestinian militants. (With inputs from The Associated Press)",

        "text": "American Mother-Daughter Hostage Released By Gaza On 'Humanitarian Grounds'    \n         Gaza:  Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, has said in a statement that it has released two American hostages for “humanitarian reasons”, in response to Qatari efforts. The brigades said that it made the move to prove that the US allegations were “false and baseless”. This is the first time that the Gaza-ruling group released hostages since the conflict began almost two weeks ago, Xinhua news agency reported.  \n             The two Americans who were released have been identified as Judith Tai Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter, Natali Raanan, both from Chicago, according to CNN. According to their family, they had been visiting relatives in Nahal Oz, a farming community in southern Israel, and they were released on “humanitarian grounds” due to the mother’s poor health.Furthermore, the release took place as part of negotiations involving Qatar and Hamas, as reported by CNN. The two released were “received on the border with Gaza and are on the way to a military base where they will meet their families”. In a press release, US President Joe Biden also confirmed his administration secured the release of two American hostages and thanked Qatar and Israel for their partnership in this work. \n             \n           \n I just spoke with the two Americans released today after being held hostage by Hamas.

These individuals and their families will have the full support of the United States government as they recover and heal, and we should all respect their privacy in this moment,” the White House statement said. Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7, firing thousands of rockets and infiltrating Israeli territory, where it seized a large number of hostages. The brigades previously stated they were holding 200 to 250 captives in Gaza. An Israeli army statement earlier in the day said a majority of the hostages were alive.",

The Prime Minister’s Office did not announce or inform the meeting about his visit in advance. Later, the PMO confirmed Trudeau’s visit to the International Muslims Organization of Toronto, clarifying that it was to show support for those affected by the events in the Middle East. \n             \n           “Everyone is hurt and hurting; everyone is grieving; everyone is scared of what this means,” Trudeau said while speaking to mediapersons on Friday in Ontario’s Brampton.

The letter urges the Canadian government to join the call for a ceasefire open the humanitarian corridor and stand up for international law. Notably, the letter was signed by eight NDP MPs, 23 backbench Liberal MPs, and both Green Party MPs. Trudeau on Israel-Hamas War The Canadian PM has not taken a side in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. He defended Israel’s “right to defend itself” and condemned Hamas’s attack. Talking about peace between Israel and Palestine, Trudeau stated that Canada is still committed to a two-state solution. He added that Hamas does not represent the Palestinians nor do they speak for Muslim or Arab communities. In the House of Commons, Justin Trudeau also declared that Canada is advocating for a humanitarian corridor to facilitate the delivery of vital aid, including food, fuel, and water, to the civilian population in Gaza.",

        "description": "Israel is still launching waves of airstrikes across Gaza that have destroyed entire neighborhoods, as Palestinian militants fire rocket barrages into Israel.",
        "text": "Trucks with humanitarian aid for the 'Gaza Strip enter from Egypt in Rafah on Saturday, Oct. 21, 2023. (AP Photo/Fatima Shbair)   \n         RAFAH, Gaza Strip:  The border crossing between Egypt and Gaza opened on Saturday to let a trickle of desperately needed aid into the besieged Palestinian territory for the first time since Israel sealed it off in the wake of Hamas’ bloody rampage two weeks ago. Gaza’s 2.3 million Palestinians, half of whom have fled their homes, are rationing food and drinking dirty water. Hospitals say they are running low on medical supplies and fuel for emergency generators amid a territory-wide power blackout. Israel is still launching waves of airstrikes across Gaza that have destroyed entire neighborhoods, as Palestinian militants fire rocket barrages into Israel.  \n             The opening came after more than a week of high-level diplomacy by various mediators, including visits to the region by U.S. President Joe Biden and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Israel had insisted that nothing would enter Gaza until some 200 people captured by Hamas were freed, and the Palestinian side of the crossing had been shut down by Israeli airstrikes. Egypt’s state-owned Al-Qahera news, which is close to security agencies, said just 20 trucks had crossed into Gaza on Saturday, out of more than 200 trucks carrying roughly 3,000 tons of aid that have been positioned near the crossing for days. Hundreds of foreign passport holders also waited to cross from Gaza to Egypt to escape the conflict. The head of the U.N.’s World Food Program said the aid was insufficient. “The situation is catastrophic in Gaza,” Cindy McCain told The Associated Press. “We need many, many, many more trucks and a continual flow of aid,” she said, adding that some 400 trucks were entering Gaza daily before the war. \n             \n           The Hamas-run government in Gaza also said the limited convoy “will not be able to change the humanitarian catastrophe,” calling for a secure corridor operating around the clock. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, said “the humanitarian situation in Gaza is under control.” He said the aid would be delivered only to southern Gaza, where the army has ordered people to relocate, adding that no fuel would enter the territory. Guterres meanwhile gave voice to growing international concern over civilians in Gaza, telling a summit in Cairo that Hamas’ “reprehensible assault” on Israel two weeks ago “can never justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.” The opening came hours after Hamas released an American woman and her teenage daughter, the first captives to be freed after the militant group’s Oct. 7 incursion into Israel. It was not immediately clear if there was any connection between the two. Hamas released Judith Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter, Natalie, on Friday for what it said were humanitarian reasons in an agreement with Qatar, a Persian Gulf nation that has often served as a Mideast mediator. The two had been on a trip from their home in suburban Chicago to Israel to celebrate Jewish holidays, the family said. They were in the kibbutz of Nahal Oz, near Gaza, when Hamas and other militants stormed into southern Israeli towns, killing hundreds and abducting at least 210 others. Hamas said it was working with Egypt, Qatar and other mediators “to close the case” of hostages if security circumstances permit. Intense airstrikes were reported across Gaza overnight and into Saturday. The Hamas-run Health Ministry said 345 people were killed in Gaza in the last 24 hours, and that seven hospitals are out of service after being damaged in strikes or running out of fuel. The Hamas-run Housing Ministry said at least 30% of all homes in Gaza have been destroyed or heavily damaged in the war. That figure does not include the destruction of entire neighborhoods, which the U.N. refugee agency now describes as “inaccessible mounds of rubble.” There are growing expectations of a ground offensive that Israel says would be aimed at rooting out Hamas, an Islamic militant group that has ruled Gaza for 16 years. Israel said Friday it does not plan to take long-term control over the small but densely populated Palestinian territory. Israel has also traded fire along its northern border with Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group, raising concerns about a second front opening up. The Israeli military said Saturday it struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in response to recent rocket launches and attacks with anti-tank missiles. “Hezbollah has decided to participate in the fighting, and we are exacting a heavy price for this,” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said during a visit to the border. Israel issued a travel warning on Saturday, ordering its citizens to leave Egypt and Jordan — which made peace with it decades ago — and to avoid travel to a number of Arab and Muslim countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Morocco and Bahrain, which forged diplomatic ties with Israel in 2020. Protests against Israel’s actions in Gaza have erupted across the region. An Israeli ground assault would likely to lead to a dramatic escalation in casualties on both sides in urban fighting. More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed in the war — mostly civilians slain during the Hamas incursion. Palestinian militants have continued to launch rockets at Israel — more than 6,900 since Oct. 7, according to the military. More than 4,100 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. That includes the disputed toll from a hospital explosion earlier this week. The ministry says another 1,400 are believed to have been buried under rubble, alive or dead. Hosting a summit on Saturday, Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi called for ensuring aid to Gaza, negotiating a cease-fire and resuming Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which last broke down more than a decade ago. He also said the conflict would never be resolved “at the expense of Egypt,” referring to fears Israel may try to push Gaza’s population into the Sinai Peninsula. King Abdullah II of Jordan told the summit that Israel’s air campaign and siege of Gaza was “a war crime” and slammed the international community’s response. “Anywhere else, attacking civilian infrastructure and deliberately starving an entire population of food, water, electricity, and basic necessities would be condemned,” he said. Apparently, he added, “human rights have boundaries. They stop at borders, they stop at races, they stop at religions.” Over a million people have been displaced in Gaza. Many heeded Israel’s orders to evacuate from north to south within the sealed-off coastal enclave. But Israel has continued to bomb areas in southern Gaza where Palestinians had been told to seek safety, and some appear to be going back to the north because of bombings and difficult living conditions in the south. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called the opening of Rafah “an important first step that will alleviate the suffering of innocent people.” Britain, France and Germany also welcomed it. The World Health Organization said four of the 20 trucks that crossed through Rafah on Saturday were carrying medical supplies, including essential supplies for 300,000 people for three months, trauma medicine and supplies for 1,200 people and 235 portable trauma bags for first responders. The World Food Program said it has another 930 metric tons of emergency food waiting to be brought in through Rafah. It said it needs to replenish its “rapidly diminishing supplies” as it expands food assistance from 520,000 people to 1.1 million in the next two months.

        "text": "United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres speaks to the media, after visiting the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, as Egyptian Red Crescent members coordinate aid for Gaza,at Al Arish Airport, Egypt, October 20, 2023. REUTERS   \n         Cairo, Egypt:  United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the the “reprehensible assault” by Hamas militants on Israel can never justify the “collective punishment” meted out to the Palestinian people by the Israeli forces.  \n             Speaking at the Cairo Peace Summit in Egypt, which convened by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to de-escalate hostilities between Israel and Gaza-based Hamas militants, Guterres asserted that the people of Palestine have legitimate grievances but the collective punishment of Palestinians can never be justified. “The grievances of the Palestinian people are legitimate and long, but nothing can justify the reprehensible assault by Hamas that terrorized Israeli civilians. At the same time, these abhorrent attacks can never justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people,” Guterres said, according to UN News. The UN chief said that hundreds of trucks “teeming with food and other essential supplies” were on the Egyptian side while across the border, two million people were going without water, food, fuel, electricity and medicine. \n             \n           “Those trucks need to move as quickly as possible in a massive, sustained and safe way from Egypt into Gaza,” he said, adding that the UN is working nonstop with all parties towards a continuous delivery of aid at the scale that is needed, UN News reported. The UN Chief further stressed that the near-term goals must be clear, repeating his call for immediate, “unrestricted and sustained humanitarian aid to Gaza, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages by Hamas, and a humanitarian ceasefire now. Guterres stressed the need to uphold international humanitarian law, which includes protecting civilians and not attacking hospitals, schools and UN premises that are currently sheltering half a million people, UN News reported. He also emphasized the need not to lose sight of “the only realistic foundation for a true peace and stability”, namely a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians. “The time has come for action…action to end this godawful nightmare. Action to build a future worthy of the dreams of the children of Palestine, Israel, the region and our world,” UN News quoted him as saying. The UN chief arrived at the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing with Gaza in northern Sinai in Egypt on Friday to oversee the UN efforts to pass humanitarian aid into Gaza. Earlier in the day, over 3,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid started entering Gaza, as the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza opened on Saturday for the first time since the horrific attack on Israel by Hamas, Times of Israel reported. More than 200 trucks carrying roughly 3,000 tons of aid, which had been positioned near the crossing for days, began heading into Gaza. The Egyptian state television also showed several trucks entering the gate, Times of Israel reported. (With ANI inputs)",

Declaring a ‘war’, Israel had also begun retaliating and it has been more than three weeks since.

The protests have been going on by the citizens to urge the government to bring back the former’s loved ones who have been held hostage by Hamas terrorists.

Israel PM Netanyahu Meets Italian PM Giorgia Meloni During this war, several world leaders including UK PM Rishi Sunak and US President Joe Biden have met the Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Calling on the Italian PM, Netanyahu said, “We have to defeat this barbarism,” adding that this battle is between the forces of civilization and “really monstrous barbarians who murdered, mutilated, raped, beheaded, and burned innocent people, babies, and grandmothers.” “This is a test, a test of civilization, and we will win. And we expect all the countries that lined up to fight ISIS, to line up and fight Hamas because Hamas is the new ISIS,” the Israeli PM’s office posted from its handle on social media platform X. Meloni assured Netanyahu of Italy’s support for Israel. “We defend the rights of Israel of defending itself… for its people. We absolutely understand that terrorism has to be fought, and we believe that you are able to do that in the best way, and we are different from those terrorists,” the Italian PM said. \n             \n           Invoking his old address at the UN, during which he drew a parallel between Hamas and ISIS, the Israeli PM’s office posted on X, “Hamas, as I said in the UN ten years ago, almost a decade ago, Hamas is ISIS. People didn’t believe me. Now they know it’s actually worse than ISIS, as President Biden said, and Chancellor Scholz said that Hamas are the new Nazis. The world united to fight the Nazis. The civilised world united to fight ISIS. And now, the civilised world should stand with us as we defeat ISIS. This is our goal.” (Inputs from ANI)",

India Sends Medical Aid For Palestinians: Israel-Hamas War Israel launched a retaliatory operation against Hamas on October 7, following a surprise attack by the latter. On Saturday, approximately 20 humanitarian aid trucks were permitted to enter the Gaza Strip through the Rafah border with Egypt. However, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cautioned that the needs in this region, which is home to more than 2 million people, are much greater. He also called for the safe passage of additional aid convoys into the enclave. While the Rafah border briefly opened to allow the 20 aid trucks in, various human rights groups have emphasized the necessity for significantly more aid. Taking to X, Ghebreyesus stated, “@WHO medical supplies crossed the Rafah border. But the needs are far higher. To meet the urgent health needs of all people in Gaza, we call for: -safe passage of additional aid convoys across the enclave -protection of all humanitarian workers -sustained access for health aid.” European Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen called termed it an “important first step that will alleviate the suffering of innocent people.” “I welcome the opening of the Rafah border crossing point to Gaza for humanitarian aid. This is an important first step that will alleviate the suffering of innocent people. My thanks go to all those involved who made this possible,” Ursula von der Leyen wrote on X. India Sends Medical Aid For Palestinians: United Nations’ Statement  According to a statement released on Thursday by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, more than 60 percent of primary care facilities in Gaza are presently non-operational, and the region’s hospitals are teetering on the edge of a collapse, as reported by CNN. This critical situation is primarily attributed to severe shortages of electricity, medicine, medical equipment, and trained medical staff.",

Israel’s military spokesman said the country is stepping up its attacks, and there are growing expectations of a ground offensive.  \n             The war, in its 16th day Sunday, is the deadliest of five Gaza wars for both sides. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said Saturday that the death toll has reached 4,385, while 13,561 people have been wounded. More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed, mostly in the initial attack on Oct. 7 when Hamas militants stormed into Israel.

The delivery would be the second shipment into the territory in the past two days. Residents of Gaza have been under an Israeli blockade that cut off food, water, medicine and electricity since Hamas militants rampaged through southern Israel on Oct. 7. The more than 2 million residents of the territory have been struggling under Israeli airstrikes and with dwindling resources since then.

(ANI Photo)   \n         Israel-Hamas War Updates:  A New Delhi-bound special flight carrying 143 persons, including two Nepalese citizens and four infants, departed war-hit Israel on Sunday as part of  ‘Operation Ajay’ which was launched by the Indian government to fly out its citizens who wished to leave the Jewish nation amid the raging war with Gaza-based Hamas militants.  \n             It was the sixth flight as part of Operation Ajay launched on October 12 to facilitate the return of those Indian nationals who wish to return home following the brazen attacks on Israeli towns by Hamas militants from Gaza on October 7. The flight is carrying 143 persons, including two Nepalese citizens and four infants, informed sources told news agency PTI. “OperationAjay continues. The sixth flight has taken off from Tel Aviv to Delhi. Embassy wishes everyone on board a safe journey,” the Indian Embassy in Tel Aviv said in a post on X. \n             \n           Eighteen Nepalese nationals were earlier accommodated on the special flight last Tuesday. Operation Ajay The voluntary departure of Indian nationals was necessitated after armed Hamas militants based in the Gaza Strip launched an unprecedented attack on Israel by land, air, and sea on October 7. So far, five chartered flights from Tel Aviv arrived in Delhi with nearly 1,200 passengers, including children. Pictures posted by the Indian embassy showed people carrying the Indian tricolour as they expressed happiness over evacuation from Israel during its ongoing war with Hamas. “#OperationAjay update Flight #6 departs from Tel Aviv,” the External Affairs Minister, S Jaishankar posted on X. The fifth flight carrying 286 Indian nationals including 18 citizens of Nepal arrived in New Delhi late on Tuesday night. Upon arrival, they were received by the Union Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting and Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying, L Murugan. “Wherever Indians are stranded, our priority is to bring them back. We have successfully conducted Operation Ganga and Operation Kaveri now under Operation Ajay we are bringing people back from Israel. This is the fifth flight, and we have already brought 1180 people back home. We are the first country to start the evacuation, and we are also bringing people belonging to our neighbour (Nepal) countries…,” the Minister said. Expressing gratitude to PM Modi’s government, Vishal, an Indian national who returned from Israel told news agency ANI, “I am coming from Haifa, Israel. We had to follow the safety protocols given by the university. The Indian government has helped us a lot, we are thankful to the embassy…” Whereas, another Indian national, Ramesh said, “We have just returned from Israel. The facilities provided by the Indian Embassy were very good. We got a lot of help from the Indian Embassy in Israel…” The fourth flight from Israel under ‘Operation Ajay’ carrying 274 Indian passengers landed in the national capital on Sunday. Union Minister of State General (Retd) VK Singh received the Indian passengers at the airport.  VK Singh informed that more flights will be carried out to evacuate the Indian citizens amid the situation in Israel. The Indian nationals applauded the operation and said that there was support from the Indian embassy and the evacuation process was nice and quick. ‘Operation Ajay’ was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring back around 18,000 Indians in Israel. Registration of Indians began on Thursday. The Indian embassy in Israel is providing assistance to Indian companies and has set up a helpline for Indian citizens in need of assistance. Israel is currently embroiled bloody conflict with Hamas militants who control the Gaza strip. \nSince the start of hostilities, nearly 4,400 Palestinians have been killed in the counter-offensive launched by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) in retaliation to the October 7 attacks. According to official Israeli sources, at least 1,400 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed in Israel. (With inputs from agencies)",

        "description": "For days, Israel has seemed to be on the verge of launching a ground offensive in Gaza following Hamas' deadly Oct. 7 rampage, with tanks and troops massed at the border.",
        "text": "Palestinian medic holds a child wounded in Israeli air strike on the Gaza Strip, in Deir el-Balah, Sunday, Oct. 22, 2023. (AP Photo/Ali Mahmoud)   \n         RAFAH, Gaza Strip:  Israeli warplanes struck targets across Gaza, two airports in Syria and a mosque in the occupied West Bank allegedly used by militants, as the 2-week-old war with Hamas threatened to spiral Sunday into a broader conflict. Israel has traded fire with Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group since the war began, and tensions are soaring in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli forces have battled militants in refugee camps and carried out two airstrikes in recent days.  \n             Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told troops in northern Israel that if Hezbollah launches a war, “it will make the mistake of its life. We will cripple it with a force it cannot even imagine and the consequences for it and the Lebanese state will be devastating.” For days, Israel has seemed to be on the verge of launching a ground offensive in Gaza following Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 rampage, with tanks and troops massed at the border. Israel’s military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said the country had increased airstrikes across Gaza to hit targets that would reduce the risk to troops in the next stage of the war. \n             \n           Hamas said it fought with Israeli forces near Khan Younis in southern Gaza and destroyed a tank and two bulldozers. The Israeli military said it had no information about the claim. On Saturday, 20 trucks entered Gaza in the first aid shipment into the territory since Israel imposed a complete siege two weeks ago. Egypt’s state-run media reported 17 more trucks crossing Sunday, but the United Nations said none had crossed. “Until now, there is no convoy,” said Juliette Touma, spokeswoman for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. Associated Press journalists saw seven fuel trucks head north from the border, but Touma and the Israeli military said those trucks were taking fuel that had been stored on the Gaza side of the crossing deeper into the territory, and that no fuel had entered from Egypt. In a sign of how precarious any movement of aid remains, the Egyptian military said in a statement that Israeli shelling hit a watchtower on Egypt’s side of the border, causing light injuries. The Israeli military apologized, saying a tank had accidentally fired and hit an Egyptian post, and the incident was being investigated. Relief workers said far more aid was needed to address the spiraling humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where half the territory’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes. The U.N. humanitarian agency, known as OCHA, said Saturday’s convoy carried about 4% of an average day’s imports before the war and “a fraction of what is needed after 13 days of complete siege.” The Israeli military said the humanitarian situation was “under control,” even as OCHA called for 100 trucks a day to enter. Israel repeated its calls for people to leave northern Gaza, including by dropping leaflets from the air. It estimated 700,000 already fled. But hundreds of thousands remain. That would raise the risk of mass civilian casualties in any ground offensive. Israeli military officials say Hamas’ infrastructure and underground tunnel system are concentrated in Gaza City, in the north, and that the next stage of the offensive will include unprecedented force there. Israel says it wants to crush Hamas. Officials have also spoken of carving out a buffer zone to keep Palestinians from approaching the border. Hospitals packed with patients and displaced people are running low on medical supplies and fuel for generators, forcing doctors to perform surgeries with sewing needles, using vinegar as disinfectant, and without anesthesia. The World Health Organization says at least 130 premature babies are at “grave risk” because of a shortage of generator fuel. It said seven hospitals in northern Gaza have been forced to shut down due to damage from strikes, lack of power and supplies, or Israeli evacuation orders. Shortages in critical supplies, including ventilators, are forcing doctors to ration treatment, said Dr. Mohammed Qandeel, who works in Khan Younis’ Nasser Hospital. Dozens of patients continue to arrive and are treated in crowded, darkened corridors, as hospitals preserve electricity for intensive care units. “It’s heartbreaking,” Qandeel said. “Every day, if we receive 10 severely injured patients we have to manage with maybe three or five ICU beds available.” Palestinians sheltering in U.N.-run schools and tent camps are running low on food and drinking dirty water. A power blackout has crippled water and sanitation systems. OCHA said cases of chickenpox, scabies and diarrhea are on the rise because of the lack of clean water. Heavy airstrikes were reported across Gaza, including in the southern part of the coastal strip, where Israel has told civilians to seek refuge. At the Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, south of the evacuation line, several bodies wrapped in white shrouds were lined up outside on the ground. Khalil al-Degran, a hospital official, said more than 90 bodies had been brought in since early Sunday, as the sound of nearby bombing echoed behind him. He said 180 wounded people had arrived, mostly children, women and the elderly who had been displaced from other areas. Airstrikes also smashed through the marketplace in the Nuseirat refugee camp. Witnesses said at least a dozen people were killed. Israel’s military has said it is striking Hamas fighters and installations, but does not target civilians. Palestinian militants have fired over 7,000 rockets at Israel, according to the military, and Hamas says it targeted Tel Aviv early Sunday. More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed — mostly civilians slain during the initial Hamas attack. At least 212 people were captured and dragged back to Gaza. Two Americans were released on Friday. More than 4,600 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. That includes the disputed toll from a hospital explosion. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that Hamas was responsible, not just for its brutal rampage in southern Israel, but for the deaths of civilians in Israel’s attacks on Gaza. “It knew that in Israel’s necessary response, civilians would be caught in that crossfire,” he said. He said the militants were operating among the civilian population and its tunnels were buried under hospitals and schools. “What does anyone expect Israel to do?” he said. “This is on Hamas.” Syrian state media, meanwhile reported that Israeli airstrikes hit the international airports in the capital, Damascus, and the northern city of Aleppo, killing one person and putting the runways out of service. Israel has carried out several strikes in Syria since the war began. Israel rarely acknowledges individual strikes, but says it acts to prevent Hezbollah and other militants from bringing in arms from Iran, which also supports Hamas. In Lebanon, Hezbollah said six fighters were killed Saturday, and the group’s deputy leader, Sheikh Naim Kassem, warned that Israel would pay a high price if it invades Gaza. Israel struck Hezbollah in response to rocket fire, the military said. Israel also announced evacuation plans for another 14 communities near the Lebanon border. In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, 91 Palestinians have been killed — including six Sunday — in clashes with Israeli troops, arrest raids and attacks by Jewish settlers since the Hamas attacks, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Israeli forces have closed crossings into the territory and checkpoints between cities, measures they say are aimed at preventing attacks. Israel says it has arrested more than 700 Palestinians since Oct. 7, including 480 suspected Hamas members. Among the dead were two killed in an airstrike on a mosque in the town of Jenin, which has seen heavy gun battles over the past year. The Israeli military said the mosque compound belonged to Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants who had carried out several attacks in recent months and were planning another. The internationally recognized Palestinian Authority administers parts of the West Bank and cooperates with Israel on security, but it is deeply unpopular and has been the target of violent Palestinian protests.

        "text": "Benjamin Netanyahu held telephonic conversations with the leaders of France, Spain, and the Netherlands on the ongoing offensive on Hamas   \n         Tel Aviv : Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday held a security assessment at the Kirya in Tel Aviv with the War Cabinet members and senior security establishment officials. Taking to his official social media ‘X’, Israeli PM Netanyahu’s office stated, “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is currently holding a security assessment at the Kirya in Tel Aviv, together with members of the War Cabinet and senior security establishment officials.”  \n             On Sunday, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said they had carried out strikes against two more Hezbollah squads in southern Lebanon before they could launch attacks on Israel. One of the Hezbollah cells, in the Mount Dov area, planned to launch rockets, while the second, near the northern town of Mattat, planned to launch an anti-tank guided missile, the IDF added. This strike marked the sixth and seventh Hezbollah cells that the IDF hit on Sunday, The Times of Israel reported. It stated further that it was currently carrying out a wave of airstrikes against dozens of Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip. \n             \n           Israel declared war on Hamas on October 7 after the terrorist group unleashed a rocket barrage from across the border in Gaza and sent in fighters, who crossed over and broke into homes, killing civilians. While many of them were engaged by Israeli forces, some managed to sneak back into Gaza with more than 200 civilian hostages. Several Merkava tanks and troops were positioned on Sunday by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) near the Gaza border in South Israel, following the government’s announcement that it intends to launch a ground operation against Hamas in the “near future”. The Merkava, a series of main battle tanks utilised by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), serves as the cornerstone of its armoured corps. The Merkava gained significant operational experience during the 1982 Lebanon War, and its name is derived from the IDF’s initial development programme. In the meantime, Benjamin Netanyahu held telephonic conversations with the leaders of France, Spain, and the Netherlands on the ongoing offensive on Hamas, underlining “the determination of the people to eliminate” the terror group’s military. Notably, he had held a series of conversations with leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. The Israeli PM’s office posted from its official handle on X, “The Prime Minister told the leaders about the unity and determination of the people to eliminate Hamas’s military and governing capabilities and said that Israel’s victory over Hamas would be a victory for the entire world.” He thanked the leaders for their support of Israel’s right to defend itself against Hamas’s “brutal terrorism”. “French President Macron and Dutch Prime Minister Rutte will arrive tomorrow and Tuesday and will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu,” the Israeli PM’s office posted on X.

        "description": "Israel Hamas War is still going on and the loss of life in both places continues to rise. Newborn babies in Gaza hospitals are struggling to breathe and might die as fuel supplies in Gaza are rapidly running out amid attacks from Israel.",
        "text": "Newborn Babies At Risk In Gaza Amid Israel Attacks   \n         New Delhi:  The  Israel Palestine Conflict  has been going on for decades but on  October 7, 2023  it turned into a full-fledged war after  Hamas  fired 5000 rockets from the  Gaza Strip  on Israel. Israel soon began its counterattacks and now three weeks later, the war continues with daily rise in the number of deceased, kidnapped, held hostage and tortured. Israel is right or Palestine, this is debatable but the main negative impact of a war, loss of life remains, irrespective of ‘which side is right’. It was reported earlier also that Gaza Hospitals are facing an alarming issue of fuel supply, which is a huge threat to the patients there, as proper treatment is not being given to them. Apart from the injured, ill and the elderly people, newborn babies might also lose their lives, especially those who were born premature and have been kept in an incubator and are breathing with ventilator support. Know more heartbreaking details..  \n             Premature Babies’ Life At Risk In Gaza According to a news agency, a premature baby squirms inside a glass incubator in the neonatal ward of al-Aqsa Hospital in the central Gaza Strip. He cries out as intravenous lines are connected to his tiny body; a ventilator helps him breathe as a catheter delivers medication and monitors flash his fragile vital signs. His life hinges on the constant flow of electricity, which is in danger of running out imminently unless the hospital can get more fuel for its generators. Once the generators stop, hospital director Iyad Abu Zahar fears that the babies in the ward, unable to breathe on their own, will perish. Dangerous Fuel Shortage May Kill Newborn Babies “The responsibility on us is huge,” Iyad Abu Zahar, Hospital Director of Al-Aqsa Hospital said. Doctors treating premature babies across Gaza are grappling with similar fears. At least 130 premature babies are at “grave risk” across six neonatal units, aid workers said. The dangerous fuel shortages are caused by the Israeli blockade of Gaza, which started – along with airstrikes – after Hamas militants attacked Israeli towns on October 7. At least 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza are unable to access essential health services, and some 5,500 are due to give birth in the coming month, according to the World Health Organisation. “If the generator stops, which we are expecting in the coming few hours due to the heavy demands of different departments in the hospital, the incubators in the intensive care unit will be in a very critical situation,” he said. Guillemette Thomas, medical coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in the Palestinian territories, said some of the babies could die within hours, and others in a couple of days, if they don’t receive the special care and medication they urgently need. \n             \n           “It’s sure that these babies are in danger,” she told The Associated Press. “It’s a real emergency to take care of these babies, as it is an emergency to take care of the population of Gaza who are suffering from these bombings since the past two weeks.” The hospital must care for patients in northern and central Gaza since several hospitals shut down, he said, forcing it to more than double its patient capacity. That also puts a strain on the limited electricity. If Situation Gets Worse, There Won’t Be Any Medicine Left…: Mother Of A Newborn Daughter Nisma al-Ayubi brought her newborn daughter to the hospital from Nuseirat, where she was recently displaced from northern Gaza, after she suffered from oxygen deprivation and extreme pain, she said. The baby girl was born three days ago but soon developed complications. “The hospital is lacking in supplies,” she said, speaking from al-Aqsa. “We are afraid that if the situation gets worse, there won’t be any medicine left to treat our kids.” Hospitals Forced To Shut Down Due To Damage By Israeli Attacks At least seven of the almost 30 hospitals have been forced to shut down due to damage from relentless Israeli strikes and lack of power, water and other supplies. Doctors in the remaining hospitals said they are on the brink. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees said Sunday it has enough fuel to last three days to serve critical needs. “The world cannot simply look on as these babies are killed by the siege on Gaza … A failure to act is to sentence these babies to death,” said Melanie Ward, chief executive of the Medical Aid for Palestinians aid group. None of the 20 aid trucks that crossed into Gaza on Saturday, the first since the siege was imposed, contained fuel, amid Israeli fears it will end up in Hamas’ hands. Limited fuel supplies inside Gaza were being sent to hospital generators. Seven tankers took fuel from a UN depot on the Gaza side of the border, but it was unclear if any of that was destined for the hospitals. But will eventually run out if more is not permitted to enter. Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesman, said 150,000 litres of fuel are required to offer basic services in Gaza’s five main hospitals. Abu Zahar worries about how long his facility can hold out. Contaminated Water, Deficit In Emergency Medicine Adds Up To Threat The problems are exacerbated by the dirty water many have been forced to use since Israel cut off the water supply. Abu Zahar says mothers are mixing baby formula with the contaminated water to feed their infants. It has contributed to the rise in critical cases in the ward. I the al-Awda Hospital, a private facility in northern Jabalia, up to 50 babies are born almost every day, said hospital director Ahmed Muhanna. The hospital received an evacuation order from the Israeli military, but continued to work. “The situation is tragic in every sense of the word,” he said. “We have recorded a large deficit in emergency medicines and anesthetic,” as well as other medical supplies. To ration dwindling supplies, Muhanna said all scheduled operations were stopped and the hospital devoted all its resources to emergencies and childbirths. Complex neo-natal cases are sent to al-Aqsa. Al-Awda has enough fuel to last four days at most, Muhanna said. “We have appealed to many international institutions, the World Health Organization, to supply hospitals with fuel, but to no avail so far,” he said. Thomas said women have already given birth in UN-run schools where tens of thousands of displaced people have sought shelter. “These women are in danger, and the babies are in danger right now,” she said.

(AP Photo/Hatem Ali)   \n         Israel Palestine War:  Israeli warplanes are striking targets across Gaza ahead of an expected ground offensive in the besieged Hamas-ruled territory. Fears of a widening war have grown as Israel struck targets in the occupied West Bank, Syria and Lebanon and traded fire with Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group. Two aid convoys arrived in the Gaza Strip over the weekend through the Rafah crossing from Egypt. Israel said the trucks carried food, water and medical supplies. Israel has not allowed in fuel, which is critically needed for water and sanitation systems and hospitals.  \n             The war, in its 17th day Monday, is the deadliest of five Gaza wars for both sides. The Palestinian Health Ministry said Sunday that at least 4,651 people have been killed and 14,254 wounded in the territory. In the occupied West Bank, 96 Palestinians have been killed and 1,650 wounded in violence and Israeli raids since Oct. 7. More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed, mostly civilians who died in the initial Hamas rampage into southern Israel. In addition, 222 people including foreigners were believed captured by Hamas during the incursion and taken into Gaza, Israel’s military has said. Two of those have been released. Currently: \n Premature babies hooked up to incubators are at risk of dying because of dwindling fuel in the Gaza Strip \n Biden walks tightrope with support for Israel as allies and the left push for restraint \n A second convoy of trucks carrying desperately needed aid reaches Gaza \n Blinken and Austin say the U.S. is ready to protect American forces should the war escalate \n Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war \n Here’s what’s happening in the latest Israel-Hamas war: GAZA’S HEALTH MINISTRY APPEALS FOR BLOOD DONATIONS AS SHORTAGES WORSEN DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip:  As conditions rapidly worsen, Gaza’s Hamas-run Health Ministry appealed on Monday for blood donations for hospitals in the besieged territory that are suffering from dire shortages of blood and medical supplies. \n             \n           The ministry urged residents to rush to hospitals and blood banks across Gaza for blood donations and called for the International Committee of the Red Cross to bring blood to the territory. IRELAND CALLS FOR AN IMMEDIATE CEASE-FIRE BRUSSELS : Ireland is calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza so that civilians can get access to desperately needed aid and supplies. Irish Foreign Minister Micheal Martin said “this is a matter of the utmost urgency. The loss of life is enormous, is at a scale that has to be stopped.” Speaking Monday in Luxembourg at a meeting of European Union foreign ministers, Martin called for food, water and medical supplies to be allowed into Gaza at an “accelerated and comprehensive scale.” “We understand Israel’s need to deal with Hamas, because it was an appalling attack. But the degree of suffering now -– the innocent civilians in Gaza suffering -– is just not acceptable at all,” he said. IRAQ SAYS IT WILL PURSUE MILITANTS WHO ATTACKED BASES HOUSING US TROOPS BAGHDAD:  Iraq’s army spokesperson says the state will go after militants who have carried out attacks against army bases housing U.S. troops in the country. Maj. Gen. Yahya Rasoul said in a statement Monday that military advisers from the U.S.-led coalition are in the country “at the invitation of the government” and their mission is to train Iraqi forces. Rasoul said the prime minister has ordered the country’s security agencies to go after those who carried out attacks and prevent any attempt to harm Iraq’s national security. Over the past week, several bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq came under rocket and drone attacks that were believed to have been carried out by Iran-backed groups. There are about 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq, whose main mission to train Iraqi forces and prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group. EUROPE MINISTERS DISCUSSING GETTING AID INTO GAZA BRUSSELS:  European Union foreign ministers are meeting Monday to discuss ways to help vital aid get into Gaza, particularly fuel, after two convoys entered over the weekend. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that “in normal times, without war, 100 trucks enter into Gaza every day. So it’s clear that 20 is not enough.” Borrell said the emphasis must be on getting power and water-providing desalination plants running again. “Without water and electricity, the hospitals can barely work,” he told reporters in Luxembourg, where the meeting is taking place. He said the ministers will also look at ways to resolve the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians longer term. “The great powers have forgotten about the Palestinian issue, thinking it was going to be solved alone, or it doesn’t matter. Yes, it matters,” Borrell said. ISRAEL SAYS 2ND BATCH OF HUMANITARIAN AID ENTERED GAZA Israel says Sunday that a second batch of humanitarian aid was allowed into Gaza, at the request of the U.S. and according to instructions from other political officials. On Saturday, 20 trucks entered in the first shipment into the territory since Israel imposed a complete siege two weeks ago. Sunday’s batch included only water, food, and medical equipment, with no fuel, Israel said. U.S. President Joe Biden and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel “affirmed that there will now be continued flow of this critical assistance into Gaza,” the White House said in a statement after a phone call between the leaders. The Israeli military said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was “under control,” even as the U.N. called for 100 trucks a day to enter. Hospitals say they are scrounging for generator fuel in order to keep operating life-saving medical equipment and incubators for premature babies. On Sunday, Associated Press journalists saw seven fuel trucks head into Gaza. Juliette Touma, spokeswoman for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, and the Israeli military said those trucks were taking fuel that had been stored on the Gaza side of the crossing deeper into the territory, and that no fuel had entered from Egypt. UNRWA SAYS THERE WILL BE NO HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE WITHOUT FUEL AMMAN, Jordan:  The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees says it will run out of fuel in Gaza in three days. “Without fuel, there will be no water, no",

        "text": "Palestinians inspect the remains of a mosque destroyed in Israeli strikes, as the conflict between Israel and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas continues, in the northern Gaza Strip October 22, 2023. REUTERS/Anas al-Shareef.   \n         JERUSALEM/GAZA:  Israel’s military said on Monday its ground forces mounted limited raids into Gaza and airstrikes targeted Palestinian militants assembling to repulse any wider Israeli invasion, as each side prepares for the next stage of the escalating war.  \n             Palestinian group Hamas said on Sunday its fighters had engaged an armoured force infiltrating a southern area of Gaza and destroyed some Israeli military equipment before returning to base. There was no Israeli comment on such losses. How soon Israel might launch a full-scale invasion is not clear, and neither side can know exactly what to expect when it does. The Middle East’s most powerful military faces a group that has built up a powerful arsenal with Iran’s help, fighting in a crowded urban setting and using a vast tunnel network it has built that Israeli troops have dubbed the “Gaza Metro”. In a televised briefing describing Israel’s latest moves on the ground, Israel’s chief military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari also said 222 people had now been confirmed as taken hostage during the Oct. 7 cross-border onslaught by Hamas. \n             \n           “During the night there were raids by tank and infantry forces. These raids are raids that kill squads of terrorists who are preparing for the next stage in the war,” he said, describing incursions that went “deep” into Gaza. “These raids also locate and search for anything we can get in terms of intelligence on the missing and the hostages.” Hagari said such interventions helped understand where “the terrorists are assembling, the terrorists are getting organised in anticipation of the next stages of the war. And our role is to reduce these threats.” Stoking expectations of a full-scale ground offensive by Israeli forces massed around Gaza, he said the military’s operational readiness was improving and being enhanced “all the time”. Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, said in a statement on Sunday that its forces had engaged with a force infiltrating east of Khan Younis in southern Gaza. “Fighters engaged with the infiltrating force, destroying two bulldozers and a tank and forced the force to withdraw, before they returned safely to base,” the statement said. INCONCLUSIVE WARS Since cross-border attacks by Hamas on Israeli communities on Oct. 7 killed 1,400 people, Israel has amassed tanks and troops near the fenced border around Gaza for a planned ground invasion. Israel has already launched intensive airstrikes on Gaza, where at least 4,600 people have been killed. Israel says it wants to wipe Hamas “off the face of the earth” after several inconclusive wars since the group seized power in the enclave in 2007, after Israel withdrew its forces from the narrow strip of land in 2005. The Israeli military said on Monday that in the past 24 hours it had struck more than 320 targets in Gaza, including a tunnel housing Hamas fighters, and command and lookout posts. Israel has said its military campaign will exceed any previous moves against Hamas, but the Palestinian group has proved capable of surprising Israel in the past and will be fighting in a dense urban setting with powerful weapons. Based on what happened in Israeli incursions in 2008 and 2014, Israel’s bunker buster bombs and hi-tech Merkava tanks will be up against a vast network of deep tunnels, booby-traps and arms including Russian-made Kornet anti-tank missiles.

Speaking to reporters in tezpur, Rajnath Singh said, “The whole world should unite against terrorism. Care should be taken so that innocent people do not get affected because of it.” During his visit to the Northeastern state, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh interacted with Armed Forces personnel deployed in the region during ‘Barakhana’ organised in Tezpur.  \n             Rajnath Singh reached Tezpur in Assam ahead of his visit to Arunachal Pradesh to celebrate Dussehra with troops and perform Shastra Puja with them. Earlier today Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a crucial telephonic conversation with King Abdullah II of Jordan to address the escalating situation between Israel and Hamas. The leaders shared their concerns over terrorism and the loss of civilian lives in the war. Both leaders underscored the need for concerted efforts to achieve an early resolution to the security and humanitarian challenges that have arisen as a result of the war. \n             \n           As the war entered its 17th day, Israel’s military ramped up its aerial offensive against Hamas. At least 436 people were killed in overnight strikes in Gaza, CNN quoted the Palestinian health ministry. At the Cairo Peace Summit, held two days back, Jordan’s King Abdullah said that the forced or internal displacement of Palestinians would be a war crime. On October 19, PM Modi for the first time spoke to the President of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas on Thursday and reiterated India’s long-standing principled position on the issue.PM Modi also expressed his condolences at the loss of lives at Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza. As many as 1,400 Israelis have died in the onslaught of the Hamas terror organisation. More than 5,000 people have been killed in Gaza since October 7, CNN quoted Palestinian health officials as saying.",

        "text": "Hamas Frees Two Israeli Women in Latest Gaza Hostage Release After Egyptian-Qatari Diplomacy (AP)   \n         Tel Aviv:  Hamas has released two elderly Israeli women, who were held hostage by the Palestinian militant group during the October 7 surprise attacks. The hostages were turned over to the International Committee of the Red Cross and were on their way home, the ICRC said in a statement. The women had been seized along with their husbands, who weren’t released, according to the Associated Press.  \n             An Israeli military spokesman in a statement confirmed the release of the two women, identified as Nurit Cooper (80) and Yocheved Lifshitz (85), to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The ICRC took them to the Rafah border, where they were handed over to Israeli officials. Hamas spokesman, Abu Obaida, in a statement, said: “We decided to release them for humanitarian reasons and health grounds. He claimed that they released the hostages despite more than eight violations of the procedures by Israel that were agreed upon. Their release came three days after Hamas militants released an American mother and her daughter on Friday in a deal mediated by Qatar and Egypt. \n             \n           “While I cannot put into words the relief that she is now safe, I will remain focused on securing the release of my father and all those — some 200 innocent people — who remain hostages in Gaza,” Lifshitz’ daughter, Sharone Lifschitz, said in a statement. Hamas apparently received nothing in exchange for the release of the two hostages, who were freed days after an American woman and her teenage daughter. Hamas and other militants in Gaza are believed to have taken roughly 220 people, including an unconfirmed number of foreigners and dual citizens. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas. Iranian-backed fighters around the region are warning of possible escalation, including the targeting of U.S. forces deployed in the Mideast, if a ground offensive is launched in Gaza. The U.S. has told Iranian-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon and other groups not to join the fight. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire almost daily across the Israel-Lebanon border, and Israeli warplanes have struck targets in the occupied West Bank, Syria and Lebanon in recent days. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said there has been an uptick in rocket and drone attacks by Iranian-backed militias on U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria, and the U.S. was “deeply concerned about the possibility for any significant escalation” in the coming days. He said U.S. officials were having “active conversations” with Israeli counterparts about the potential ramifications of escalated military action. The U.S. advised Israeli officials that delaying a ground offensive would give Washington more time to work with regional mediators on the release of more hostages, according to a U.S. official.

        "text": "Another Hamas terrorist said after doing their handler's bidding, they burned down two houses.   \n         Tel Aviv:  The Israel Securities Authority (ISA) released a video clip on Monday, purportedly showing Hamas terrorists confessing their active participation in the deadly terror attacks in southern Israel on October 7. A video file provided by ISA Communications was attached to the statements of the Hamas terrorists, involved in the October 7 attacks, during interrogation, the Authority added.  \n             In the video, the Hamas terrorists are purportedly heard saying that they were promised a stipend for taking civilian hostages from Israel to Gaza. “Whoever kidnaps a hostage and brings them to Gaza is to get a stipend of USD 10,000 and an apartment,” a Hamas terrorist is purportedly heard saying in the video. They are also heard saying that they were specifically instructed by their handlers to abduct elderly women and children. \n             \n           They said they were also asked to “cleanse the houses and kidnap as many prisoners as possible,” one of the terrorists said. “Her (a victim’s) dog came out and I shot him,” the terrorist is heard saying further in the video, adding, “Her body was lying on the floor, I shot her too. The commander yelled at me, saying (that) I was wasting bullets on a corpse.” Another Hamas terrorist said after doing their handler’s bidding, they burned down two houses. “We finished what we came to do and then burned down two houses,” he said. Over the course of the ongoing investigations into the October 7 killings, a number of “themes” (nature and manner of crimes) have come up repeatedly, the ISA said in their statement. While purportedly admitting to clear and explicit instructions received by Hamas to kill and abduct civilians, including the elderly, women and children, the terrorists, in the video clip, also shared other morbid details from of October 7 massacre in southern Israel. Meanwhile, the ISA said the senior commanders of the military wing of Hamas (of the rank of company commander rank and above) stayed behind in safe houses and in hiding while sending their gunmen to fight, die or be arrested in Israel. The Israel Security Forces reaffirmed their commitment to eliminate all terrorists involved in the massacre. “The Security Forces of the State of Israel will settle all accounts with all terrorists who participated in the massacre on 7/10,” the statement said. Launching unprecedented and coordinated attacks, an estimated 2,500 Hamas terrorists crossed over into Israel by land, air and sea, committing chilling acts of terror on civilians in southern Israel. The attacks left 1,400 people, the majority of whom were civilians, dead, according to reports. Some of these terrorists took at least 222 civilians hostage and brought them to Gaza, according to The Times of Israel.",

        "title": "Is Israel’s Iron Dome Missile Defense System Ironclad?",
        "description": "The Iron Dome is a series of batteries that use radars to detect incoming short-range rockets and intercept them.",
        "text": "IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said on Wednesday that Iran directly aided Hamas ahead of the October 7 attack on southern Israel.   \n         Jerusalem:  Since Israel activated the Iron Dome in 2011, the cutting-edge rocket-defense system has intercepted thousands of rockets fired from the Gaza Strip. The system has given residents a sense of security, and Israelis can often be seen watching the projectiles flying through the skies and destroying their targets overhead. But the current war with Gaza’s militant Hamas group might be its stiffest challenge yet. In just two weeks, Hamas has fired 7,000 rockets toward Israel, according to the Israeli military. That is more than any of the previous four wars fought between Israel and Hamas since the militant group seized power in Gaza in 2007.  \n             On Oct. 7 alone, the first day of fighting, Hamas launched at least 2,000 rockets, according to data from West Point. Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group has also fired hundreds of rockets along Israel’s northern front since the fighting began. Most of the rockets have been intercepted. But some have managed to get through, killing at least 11 people and hitting buildings as far away as Tel Aviv, according to Israeli officials. Here is a look at the accomplishments — and limitations — of the Iron Dome. \n             \n           HOW DOES THE IRON DOME WORK? The Iron Dome is a series of batteries that use radars to detect incoming short-range rockets and intercept them. Each battery has three or four launchers, 20 missiles, and a radar, according to Raytheon, the U.S. defense giant that co-produces the system with Israel’s Rafael Defense Systems. Once the radar detects a rocket, the system determines whether the rocket is headed toward a populated area. If so, it launches a missile to intercept and destroy the rocket. If the system determines the rocket is headed to an open area or into the sea, it is allowed to land, thus conserving missiles. According to the military, all interceptions occur in Israeli airspace. The military declined to comment on how many Iron Dome batteries are currently deployed. But as of 2021, Israel had 10 batteries scattered around the country, each able to defend a territory of 60 square miles (155 square kilometers), according to Raytheon. The Iron Dome is part of a larger multi-layer air-defense system that includes the Arrow, which intercepts long-range ballistic missiles, and also David’s Sling, which intercepts medium-range missiles such as those believed to be possessed by Hezbollah in Lebanon. Both systems, like the Iron Dome, were jointly developed with the United States. Israel is also developing a laser-based system called the Iron Beam that it says will be able to intercept rockets and other short-range threats at a fraction of the cost of the Iron Dome. Israel says that system, developed with U.S. funding, has not yet been deployed. HOW ACCURATE IS THE IRON DOME? It is roughly 90% effective, according to Rafael. But it can get overwhelmed if a mass barrage of rockets is fired, allowing some to slip through. While it has performed well so far, the risk could be raised if Hezbollah enters the war. Hezbollah has an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles. HOW EXPENSIVE IS THE SYSTEM? Each missile costs an estimated $40,000 to $50,000, according to the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv think tank. The U.S. has invested heavily in the system, helping with development costs and replenishing it during times of fighting. President Joe Biden has said he will ask Congress for $14.3 billion in military aid for Israel. The majority of that would help with air and missile defense systems, according to the White House. “We’re surging additional military assistance, including ammunition and interceptors to replenish Iron Dome,” Biden said.",

        "description": "The soaring death toll from Israel’s escalating bombardment was unprecedented in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict.",
        "text": "A Palestinian carries a child killed in the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip in Rafah, Tuesday, Oct. 24, 2023. (AP Photo/Hatem Ali)   \n         RAFAH, Gaza Strip:  Rapidly expanding Israeli airstrikes across the Gaza Strip killed more than 700 people in the past day as medical facilities across the territory were forced to close because of bombing damage and a lack of power, health officials said Tuesday.  \n             The soaring death toll from Israel’s escalating bombardment was unprecedented in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It could signal an even greater loss of life in Gaza once Israeli ground forces backed by tanks and artillery launch an expected offensive into the territory aimed at crushing Hamas. Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been under increasing bombardment and running out of food, water and medicine since Israel sealed off the territory following the devastating Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants on towns in southern Israel. On Tuesday, Israel said it had launched 400 airstrikes over the past day, killing Hamas commanders, hitting militants as they were preparing to launch rockets into Israel and striking command centers and a Hamas tunnel shaft. The previous day, Israel reported 320 strikes. Witnesses and health officials said many of the airstrikes hit residential buildings, some of them in southern Gaza where Israel had told civilians to take shelter. \n             \n           An overnight strike hit a four-story residential building in the southern city of Khan Younis, killing at least 32 people and wounding scores of others, according to survivors. The fatalities included 13 from the Saqallah family, said Ammar al-Butta, a relative who survived the airstrike. He said there were about 100 people there, including many who had come from Gaza City, which Israel has ordered civilians to evacuate. “They were sheltering at our home because we thought that our area would be safe. But apparently there is no safe place in Gaza,” he said. Another airstrike hit a bustling marketplace in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing several shoppers and wounding dozens, witnesses said. Men used sledgehammers to break up concrete and dug with their bare hands through the jagged wreckage to save anyone they could – or at least recover the dead who had been buying meat and vegetables when the explosion hit. A man buried up to his chest in rubble looked up at his rescuers with wide eyes, his face coated in dust from the blast. An oxygen mask was placed on his face as they spent 15 minutes working to free him. Gaza’s Hamas-run Health Ministry said the attacks killed at least 704 people over the past day, including 305 children and 173 women. More than 5,700 Palestinians have been killed in the war, including some 2,300 minors, the ministry said, without giving a detailed breakdown. The figure includes the disputed toll from an explosion at a hospital last week. Most of the Palestinians killed since Oct. 7 were in the north and central areas of the enclave that Israel had told them evacuate, the ministry said. The fighting has killed more than 1,400 people in Israel — mostly civilians slain during the initial Hamas attack. As the death toll in Gaza spiralled, facilities to deal with the casualties were dwindling. A total of 46 out of 72 primary health-care facilities, and 12 out of 35 hospitals, stopped",

        "text": "Israel-Hamas War: Missile Misfires, Strikes Egyptian Border Town Of Taba, Many Injured    \n         Tel Aviv:  Amid ongoing war between Israel and terrorist group Hamas, US President Joe Biden said Israelis can make their own decision as he was asked whether the US was urging Israel to delay its ground invasion in Gaza. As the conflict entered 19 days, the Israel Defence Forces on Tuesday announced that they were ready to ‘invade’ Gaza, as reported by The Jerusalem Post. In a statement, IDF chief-of-staff, Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi said, “I want to be clear, we are ready to invade.”  \n             “At this stage, there are tactical and strategic factors which are allowing us more time to improve and to exploit every minute to be more ready,” the IDF chief said and added that the IDF was in the process of deciding on the ‘exact timing’ of the ground invasion of Gaza in coordination with the country’s political echelons. On the delay in the counter-invasion of Gaza after the Hamas terror attacks on Israel on October 7, the IDF chief-of-staff was quoted by the Jerusalem Post as saying, “At this stage, there are tactical and strategic factors which are allowing us more time to improve and to exploit every minute to be more ready.” He added that with “every minute that passes”, they are “attacking the enemy more”. \n             \n           “With every minute that passes for the other side, we are attacking the enemy more, killing its fighters, killing its commanders, destroying its infrastructure, and collecting more intelligence for the next moves,” he added. “We are keeping him in tension,” Halevi said, adding that the longer Hamas waits for the Israeli invasion, the more stressed it will become, the Jerusalem Post reported. Meanwhile, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) on Tuesday said under the intelligence guidance of the Shin Bet, it thwarted terrorists of the Hamas terror organization. “The Air Force under the intelligence guidance of the Shin Bet thwarted terrorists of the terrorist organization Hamas tonight, among them: – Abd al-Rahman, deputy commander of the Nuzirat Battalion, participated in the murderous raid on Kibbutz Bari. – Khalil Mahjaz, deputy commander of the Shati Battalion. – Khalil Tethari, deputy commander of the Sheik Radwan Battalion,” the Israeli Air Force posted from its official handle on X. Earlier, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shared on X that Israel has only one task at hand, which is to crush Hamas and it won’t stop till the objective is accomplished. “With the fighters in the field, we have only one task — to crush Hamas, and we will not stop until we complete the task,” the Israeli PM stated. Moreover, according to a report in The Times of Israel, infiltration alarms were sounding in Netiv Ha’asara, a kibbutz just north of Gaza, after similar soundings earlier in Zikim and Karmia. While residents were largely evacuated, those choosing to stay back were told to stay at home and lock their doors, according to the report.",

        "description": "Macron’s visit comes more than two weeks after Hamas members stormed into Israel, killing at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians, including about 30 French citizens.",
        "text": "Macron Warns Far-Right, Hard-Left Policies Could Lead To 'Civil War' Ahead Of Snap Polls \n   \n         Jerusalem:  The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has proposed widening the international coalition against Islamic State to fight the Palestinian militant group Hamas as he made a visit to Israel. Macron emphasised that France and Israel shared terrorism as their “common enemy” as he spoke alongside the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. “France is ready for the international coalition against ISIS–in which we are engaged in our operations in Iraq and Syria–to also fight against Hamas,” he told reporters.  \n             Macron also warned against the risks of a regional conflict, stressing the fight against Hamas “must be without mercy but not without rules”. Thirty French citizens were killed by Hamas militants in their attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. The French president, who met families of French victims at Tel Aviv airport, said freeing nine French hostages was the first priority for France. “They must all be freed,” he said. He also called for a “decisive relaunch” of the Middle East peace process. “The Palestinian cause must be heard with reason,” he said, adding that the stability of the region would only be guaranteed if the Israeli response was “obviously security orientated and implacable in the face of terrorist groups, but also political”. He said it was necessary “to accept the legitimate right of the Palestinians to have access to a territory and a state in peace and security” alongside Israel. \n             \n           Earlier, Macron told President Isaac Herzog in Jerusalem that France stood “shoulder to shoulder” with Israel. Beyond showing solidarity, Macron wanted to make “proposals that are as operational as possible” to prevent an escalation, to free hostages, and guarantee Israel’s security and work towards a two-state solution, presidential advisers said. He will push for a humanitarian truce, they added. Macron’s visit comes after European Union foreign ministers on Monday struggled to agree on a call for a “humanitarian pause” in the war between Israel and Hamas to allow much more aid to reach civilians. Mahmoud Abbas’s office said Macron would meet the Palestinian leader in Ramallah, in the West Bank. ‘Soft power faded’ Macron’s ability to influence events in the region appears limited by what some analysts say is a shift towards a more pro-Israel Anglo-American line, in contrast with the traditionally distinctive and more pro-Arab French Gaullist approach. “France’s soft power south of the Mediterranean has considerably faded,” said Karim Emile Bitar, a Beirut-based foreign policy expert at French think tank IRIS.”We’re under the impression that nothing distinguishes France from other Western countries now,” he said.The French government’s decision to adopt a blanket ban on pro-Palestinian protests, before it was struck down by courts, is one reason Macron has lost credit in the Arab world, he said. French officials contest the idea that Macron’s policy is biased. They say Macron has constantly reaffirmed the rights of Palestinians and the position of a two-state solution.Macron’s visit will also have a special resonance at home, where France’s large Muslim and Jewish communities are on tenterhooks following the killing of a teacher by an Islamist militant that French officials have linked to the events in Gaza. The French leader will have to tread a fine line during his tour of the region, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict having stoked tension at home and with France’s fractious opposition ready to pounce on any faux pas. The coalition fighting Islamic State was formed in September 2014 and has supported local partners “to deliver the military defeat of Daesh in Iraq and Syria” and “works to advise, assist and enable” them, including with reconnaissance and intelligence, it says on its website.

        "description": "Israel Hamas Conflict has turned into a war and has entered its fourth week. Amid the attacks, it has been announced by a Palestinian spokesperson that there has been a 'total collapse' of the health system in Gaza.",
        "text": "Gaza Strip Medical System Collapses Totally   \n         New Delhi:   Israel and Palestine  have been at opposite ends of diplomatic relations for decades and the conflict between the two nations has been going on for a very long time. On October 7, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, firing thousands of rockets and sending its forces into Israeli territory, to which Israel responded with massive airstrikes and punitive measures, including a siege on the enclave with supplies of water, electricity, fuel, and other necessities being cut off. The ongoing  Israel-Hamas conflict  has so far killed nearly 5,800 Palestinians in the  Gaza Strip  and more than 1,400 people in Israel. As always, the war has had and continues to have devastating effects with loss of life and property; with continuous attacks, both Gaza and Israel have their complaints and issues. According to a Palestinian spokesperson, the medical system in the Gaza Strip has ‘collapsed completely’.  \n             ‘Total Collapse’ Of Medical System In Gaza: Palestinian Spokesperson A Palestinian spokesman has announced the “total collapse” of the health system in the Gaza Strip due to power outage and the exhaustion of fuel needed to operate generators in hospitals. Ashraf Al-Qudra, spokesman for the Gaza-based Health Ministry, told a press conference on Tuesday that Israeli attacks had so far killed 65 medical staff, destroyed 25 ambulances, and made 12 hospitals and 32 health centres in the Palestinian enclave inoperable, Xinhua news agency reported. “We fear that more (hospitals and health centres) will be out of service in the coming hours due to the attacks and running out of fuel,” said the spokesman. Fuel Shortage In Hospitals May Kill Newborn Babies It was reported a few days ago that many newborn premature babies are at risk due to the fuel shortage in the hospitals in the Gaza Strip. “The responsibility on us is huge,” Iyad Abu Zahar, Hospital Director of Al-Aqsa Hospital said. Doctors treating premature babies across Gaza are grappling with similar fears. At least 130 premature babies are at “grave risk” across six neonatal units, aid workers said. The dangerous fuel shortages are caused by the Israeli blockade of Gaza, which started – along with airstrikes – after Hamas militants attacked Israeli towns on October 7. At least 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza are unable to access essential health services, and some 5,500 are due to give birth in the coming month, according to the World Health Organisation. “If the generator stops, which we are expecting in the coming few hours due to the heavy demands of different departments in the hospital, the incubators in the intensive care unit will be in a very critical situation,” he said. Guillemette Thomas, medical coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in the Palestinian territories, said some of the babies could die within hours, and others in a couple of days, if they don’t receive the special care and medication they urgently need. \n             \n           “It’s sure that these babies are in danger,” she told The Associated Press. “It’s a real emergency to take care of these babies, as it is an emergency to take care of the population of Gaza who are suffering from these bombings since the past two weeks.” The hospital must care for patients in northern and central Gaza since several hospitals shut down, he said, forcing it to more than double its patient capacity. That also puts a strain on the limited electricity. (Inputs from IANS)",

It is then,  Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  declared war against Palestine and  Gaza  and started retaliation attacks.

The nonprofit has demanded the UN chief’s resignation over his remarks. The Combat Antisemitism Movement in a statement said that it was unbelievable and unconscionable as how out of touch with reality Guterres was. CAM CEO Sacha Roytman Dratwa Statement CAM CEO Sacha Roytman Dratwa said: “Over the last couple of weeks, our generation has had a chance to reflect and better understand how the Holocaust was allowed to happen by the silence and complicity of global decision-makers and opinion-shapers in the face of Nazi-style atrocities. The fact that the so-called leader of the most prominent international institution has engaged in victim-blaming shows how he clearly has different rules for Jews among all the other peoples of the world.” Sacha Roytman Dratwa further says, “He sees the blood of masses of Jews spilled and can only think of the political ramifications. Would he have said that the Holocaust didn’t happen in a vacuum, which is a repugnant but sadly increasing global sentiment? These comments are just a thin whisper away and hold the Jewish people uniquely responsible for their own massacres, rapes, beheadings, and kidnappings.” CAM joins the growing number of people and institutions calling for Gutteres’ immediate resignation as UN Secretary-General, she said. \n             \n           (Inputs from IANS)",

        "description": "Israel Palestine Conflict has turned into a war as both nations are busy attacking each other. After the Iron Dome, Israel has now used another lethal weapon system called 'Iron Sting'. What is Iron Sting, how is it used, and what all information about it is available, know everything..",
        "text": "Israel Uses For First Time, Iron Sting   \n         New Delhi:   Israel and Palestine  have been at war since October 7; it is soon going to be a month and the attacks do not seem to end anytime soon. It was  Hamas  who first attacked Israel on October 7, suddenly but soon after, Israel was ready with its counter-attacks which have continued. The nation is going strong in terms of ‘wiping off’ Hamas joints and places; the country first used the  ‘Iron Dome’  Defence System that made quite a few headlines and now its using the  ‘Iron Sting’ Weapon System . More about the ‘Iron Sting’ has been disclosed by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) via a video. What is the ‘Iron Sting’, how is it being used by Israel against Hamas and how dangerous and ‘lethal’ is the weapon system, know everything..  \n             What Is ‘Iron Sting’? ‘Iron Sting’ is a weapon system which was invented by the Elbit Systems and was disclosed by the Israeli Defence Forces and Defence Ministry of Israel, for the first time in 2021. Described as an ‘innovative and accurate mortar bomb’, the Iron Sting is a part of a range of several weapons which are utilised to counteract to the multiple threats in the Middle-East. This system was first revealed by the IDF on Sunday when it was used to strike down rocket launchers of the Hamas Terrorists, in the Gaza Strip. As mentioned earlier, Iron Sting is an ‘innovative and accurate mortar bomb’ which is built to be used in both open spaces and dense urban environments; the system specifically targets what needs to be destroyed and thus limits the possibility of attack or hurt the non-combatants. \n יחידת מגלן בשיתוף חיל-האוויר, סיכלה עשרות מחבלים באמצעות מגוון אמצעי לחימה, ביניהם פצצת מרגמה (פצמ״ר) חדשנית ומדויקת, הנקראת “עוקץ פלדה”. \n צפו בתיעוד מתקיפת משגר רקטות באמצעות “עוקץ פלדה”  pic.twitter.com/ucphdgboJN \n — Israeli Air Force (@IAFsite)  October 22, 2023 More About ‘Iron Sting’ According to a report by The Jerusalem Post, the weapon includes a mortar of 120mm, it has GPS facilities and for hitting targets with utmost precision, it uses laser guidance. The range of this weapon is 1-12 KM. The Iron Sting Weapon System was showcased when in action, by the Israeli Defence Forces, in a video footage. It has also been said that the aim of designing the system is to revolutionize ground warfare, provide battalions with accurate, organic and highly effective firepower. The testing of this system was completed in 2021 and in a press release, then-Defence Minister Benny Gantz said that the system is set to address specific needs of the IDF by adapting combat capabilities to confront adversaries concealed within civilian, urban areas while adhering to legal and moral standards set by State of Israel. \n             \n           Commander Of Commando Brigade, Col. Omer Cohen Statement Col. Omer Cohen, Commander of the Commando Brigade was quoted as saying by The Jerusalem Post, “Thanks to the precision, lethality, and expertise of fighters, the Maglan unit in cooperation with the Air Fore took out dozens of terrorists with a variety of means, one of which is the precision mortar “Iron Sting”. From the beginning of the war, the Commando Brigade fought fiercely against the enemy’s brutal attack and eliminated over 100 terrorists in the Gaza Strip. Regular and reservist Maglan, Egoz and Duvdevan units will get to any place and any enemy and eliminate them. Together we will win; I am sure of our soldiers and trust them.”",

        "description": "Ambassador Naor Gilon said Israel conveyed to relevant Indian authorities to declare Hamas as a terrorist organisation following its surprise assault on the Jewish nation on October 7.",
        "text": "Israel Ambassador to India Naor Gilon speaks to the media on the Israel-Palestine conflict, in New Delhi. (File Photo: ANI)   \n         Israel-Hamas War Updates:  Israeli ambassador Naor Gilon on Wednesday urged India to proscribe Gaza-based militant group Hamas as a terrorist organisation. Interacting with journalists here, the Israeli envoy thanked India for its “100 per cent” support to Israel in its anti-terror operations against Hamas and stated that time has come for New Delhi to declared the militant group as a a terror outfit.  \n             “It is time for India to declare Hamas as terrorist organisation in India,” Gilon said, adding many countries have already done that. Gilon said Israel conveyed to relevant Indian authorities to declare Hamas as a terrorist organisation following its surprise assault on the Jewish nation on October 7. The ambassador hinted that the matter had been taken up earlier as well. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among first world leaders to condemn the terror attack… India is a very important moral voice in the world and the important countries for us are with us,” Gilon said. \n             \n           “India is solidly supporting us in our counter-terror operations,” he said. The latest conflict has been triggered by the unprecedented and multi-pronged attacks against Israel by Hamas militants from Gaza on October 7. Israel launched a massive counter offensive in Gaza to avenge the attacks. “For Israel, it is a war to survive in the Middle East,” Gilon said, asserting that Israel is determined to destroy Hamas. He said the purpose of the Israeli action against Hamas is to ensure that the brutality that was perpetrated by the organisation is not repeated. Israel-Hamas war Israel is currently embroiled bloody conflict with Hamas militants who control the Gaza strip. \nSince the start of hostilities, more than 5,700 Palestinians have been killed in the counter-offensive launched by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) in retaliation to the October 7 attacks. According to official Israeli sources, at least 1,400 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed in Israel. On Tuesday, rapidly expanding Israeli airstrikes across the Gaza Strip killed more than 700 Palestinians as medical facilities across the territory were forced to close because of bombing damage and a lack of power. Gaza’s Hamas-run Health Ministry said the attacks killed at least 704 people over the past day, including 305 children and 173 women. Nearly 2,300 minors have been killed in the Israeli offensive, the ministry said, without giving a detailed breakdown. The figure includes the disputed toll from an explosion at a hospital last week.

        "description": "Health officials said the death toll was soaring as Israeli jets pounded Gaza overnight into Wednesday.\r\nThe territory's Health Ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, said more than 750 people were killed over the past 24 hours.",
        "text": "Russia, China Veto US-Backed Resolution On Worsening Humanitarian Crisis In Gaza At UN   \n         RAFAH, Gaza Strip:  The U.N. warned on Wednesday that it is on the verge of running out of fuel in the Gaza Strip, forcing it to sharply curtail relief efforts in the territory blockaded and devastated by Israeli airstrikes since Hamas militants launched an attack on Israel more than two weeks ago.  \n             The warning came as hospitals in Gaza struggled to treat masses of wounded with dwindling resources. The U.N.’s top official faced backlash from Israel after saying the Hamas massacre of Israelis on Oct. 7 that sparked the fighting did not “take place in a vacuum.” Health officials said the death toll was soaring as Israeli jets pounded Gaza overnight into Wednesday. \nThe territory’s Health Ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, said more than 750 people were killed over the past 24 hours. The Associated Press could not independently verify the death toll, and it was not known if the count included any militants. \n             \n           The Israeli military said its strikes killed militants and destroyed tunnels, command centers, weapons storehouses and other military targets. It accuses Hamas of magnifying the suffering of Gazan civilians by hiding its fighters among them. Hamas and other militants have launched unrelenting rocket barrages into Israel since the conflict started. The rising death toll in Gaza — following a reported 704 killed the day before — was unprecedented in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Even greater loss of life could come if Israel launches an expected ground offensive aimed at crushing Hamas. The Gaza Health Ministry says more than 6,500 Palestinians have been killed in the war. The figure includes the disputed toll from an explosion at a hospital last week. The fighting has killed more than 1,400 people in Israel — mostly civilians slain during the initial Hamas attack, according to the Israeli government. Hamas also holds some 222 hostages in Gaza. The warning by the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, over depleting fuel supplies raised alarm that the humanitarian crisis could quickly worsen. Gaza’s population has been running out of food, water and medicine, too, under Israel’s seal. About 1.4 million of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents have fled their homes, with nearly half of them crowded into U.N. shelters. In recent days, Israel let a small number of trucks with aid enter from Egypt but barred deliveries of fuel – needed to power generators — saying it believes Hamas will take it. UNRWA has been sharing its own fuel supplies so that trucks can distribute aid, bakeries can feed people in shelters, water can be desalinated, and hospitals can keep incubators, life support machines and other vital equipment working. If it continues doing all of that, fuel will run out by Thursday, so it is deciding how to ration it, UNRWA spokeswoman Tamara Alrifai told The Associated Press. “Do we give for the incubators or the bakeries? Do we bump clean water, or do we send trucks to the borders?” she said. “It is an excruciating decision.” More than half of Gaza’s primary healthcare facilities and roughly a third of its hospitals have stopped",

        "text": "Russia, China Veto US-Backed Resolution On Worsening Humanitarian Crisis In Gaza At UN   \n         New Delhi:  Russia and China vetoed a U.S.-drafted U.N. Security Council resolution on the war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The draft aimed to address a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, calling for pauses the violence to allow aid access. The United Arab Emirates also voted no, while 10 members voted in favor and two abstained.  \n             The council then voted on a Russian-drafted resolution that called for a humanitarian ceasefire. Only Russia, China, the UAE and Gabon voted in favour of the draft, while nine members abstained (Albania, Brazil, Ecuador, France, Ghana, Japan, Malta, Mozambique, Switzerland) and the US and Britain voted no. A resolution needs at least nine votes and no vetoes by the US, France, Britain, Russia or China to be adopted. The votes came after the council twice voted unsuccessfully last week — only five members voted in favour of a Russian draft resolution on October 16 and then the US vetoed a Brazilian draft text on October 18, which had received 12 yes votes. The US proposed its own draft text on Saturday that initially shocked some diplomats with its bluntness in stating Israel has a right to defend itself and demanding Iran stop exporting arms to militant groups. \n             \n           It then toned down the overall draft, removing direct references to Iran and to Israel’s right to self-defence. But Russia announced on Tuesday that it could not support the US plan for action and put forward its own text. Israel has vowed to wipe out the Hamas Islamist group that rules Gaza, after its gunmen burst through the barrier fence surrounding the enclave on October 7 and rampaged through Israeli towns and kibbutzes, killing 1,400 people. Israel has since pounded Gaza from the air, imposed a siege and is preparing for a ground offensive. Palestinian authorities say more than 6,500 people have been killed in the enclave. The UN says about 1.4-million are homeless",

IDF tanks & infantry struck numerous terrorist cells, infrastructure and anti-tank missile launch posts. The soldiers have since exited the area and returned to Israeli territory.” \n             \n           Israeli PM Netanyahu Promises Ground Incursion To Destroy Hamas Reiterating his words, “Israel is in a battle for its existence”, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that his goal against the Hamas war is “saving the nation” and promises that a ground incursion to destroy Hamas in Gaza will start soon, The Times of Israel reported on Wednesday.He says Israel is getting ready for a ground operation, but will not share when or how. He says he will not share the range of considerations involved.”We are preparing for a ground incursion. I won’t specify when, how, how many. I also won’t detail the range of considerations, most of which the public is not aware of. And that’s the way it is supposed to be. This is the way, so that we protect our soldiers’ lives.” In an address to the nation, PM Netanyahu said, “Israel is in the midst of a fight for our existence. The war’s two aims are “to eliminate Hamas by destroying its military and governance capabilities, and to do everything possible to get our hostages back.” According to The Times of Israel, PM added, “All Hamas members are dead men walking — above and below ground, inside and outside Gaza. Together with Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, Minister Benny Gantz, the security cabinet, the chief of staff and heads of the security organizations, we are working around the clock in order to achieve the war aims until victory, and doing so without political considerations. “The goal is “saving the nation, achieving victory.” Thousands of terrorists have been killed, he says, “and that is only the beginning.”Netanyahu says there was a unanimous decision about the timing of the ground incursion. “The timing of the operation was determined unanimously by the war cabinet and the chief of staff,” he says. “We will extract the full price from those murderers, those perpetrators of atrocities… from Hamas-Daesh,” in the ground invasion, he says, The Times of Israel reported. He again called on Gazan noncombatants to head to southern Gaza. He said the huge pain of the loss of 1,400 people in Hamas onslaught is not forgotten, referring to “our brothers and sisters who were slaughtered in cold blood and who fell in heroic battles” against the predators. He added the days of mourning will be called in memory of those killed in the assault. And he vows that the devastated southern kibbutzim and communities will be rebuilt. The prime minister stresses that that government ministries are coming up with plans to take care of the displaced in Israel, and to take care of the rest of the population “just like we did during COVID.”",

        "description": "Israel also said it had also carried out around 250 airstrikes across Gaza in the last 24 hours, targeting tunnel shafts, rocket launchers and other militant infrastructure belonging to Hamas.",
        "text": "Palestinians evacuate two wounded boys out of the destruction following Israeli airstrikes on Gaza City, Wednesday, Oct. 25, 2023. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have decided to stay in their homes in northern Gaza despite Israeli warnings that they are facing grave danger if they don't move to an evacuation zone in the southern part of the territory. (AP Photo)   \n         Israel-Hamas War Update:  Israeli troops and tanks briefly raided northern Gaza overnight, the military said Thursday, engaging with Hamas fighters and targeting anti-tank weapons in order to “prepare the battlefield” before an expected ground invasion.  \n             The raid came after after more than two weeks of devastating airstrikes in the small, densely-populated territory — with more than 250 in the past 24 hours — and as the U.N. and other world leaders warn of a dire humanitarian crisis getting worse. Israel has imposed a suffocating siege on Gaza since Hamas’ bloody rampage and hostage-taking across southern Israel ignited the war. Residents are running out of food, water and medicine, and U.N. workers have barely any fuel left to support their relief missions across Gaza, where more than 1 million Palestinians have been displaced. The rising death toll in Gaza is unprecedented in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza said Thursday more than 7,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, a figure that could not be independently verified. Even greater loss of life could come if Israel launches a ground offensive aimed at crushing Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007 and survived four previous wars with Israel. \n             \n           Israeli airstrikes in the southern city of Khan Younis leveled more than eight homes belonging to an extended family, killing at least 15 people. Ambulances raced to the scene as dust from the collapsing buildings hung in the air. The blast zone was a chaotic wasteland of crumbled concrete and twisted metal. Rescuers carried wounded people covered in gray dust. The body of a boy was dug out from beneath a concrete slab, where his head had come to rest next to the foot of another person entombed in the wreckage. The Israeli military says it only strikes militant targets and accuses Hamas of operating among civilians in an attempt to protect its fighters. Palestinian militants have thousands of rockets into Israel since the war began. One struck a residential building in the central city of Petah Tikva, without wounding anyone. \nHamas’ military wing said Thursday that Israeli bombardment has so far killed about 50 of the at least 224 hostages the militants abducted during its Oct. 7 assault. There was no immediate comment from Israeli officials, who have denied previous, similar claims. The conflict has threatened to ignite a wider war across the region. Hezbollah, an Iranian-funded ally of Hamas operating out of Lebanon, has repeatedly traded fire with Israel along the border. Israel has carried out airstrikes in Lebanon, Syria and even the occupied West Bank. The United States has sent to the region two aircraft carrier strike groups with a number of ships, along with additional fighter jets and other weaponry and personnel. Israel has vowed to crush Hamas’ capacity to govern Gaza or threaten Israel again, while also saying it doesn’t want to reoccupy the territory from which it withdrew soldiers and settlers in 2005. That could prove a daunting challenge, since Hamas is deeply rooted in Gaza, with political and charity organizations as well as a formidable armed wing. Benny Gantz, a retired general and a member of Israel’s war Cabinet, said any possible ground offensive would be only “one stage in a long-term process that includes security, political and social aspects that will take years.” “The campaign will soon ramp up with greater force,” he added. During the overnight raid, soldiers killed fighters and destroyed militant infrastructure and anti-tank missile launching positions, the military said. It said no Israelis were wounded. There was no immediate confirmation of any Palestinian casualties. Israeli Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, a military spokesman, said the limited incursion was “part of our preparations for the next stages of the war.” Israel also said it had also carried out around 250 airstrikes across Gaza in the last 24 hours, targeting tunnel shafts, rocket launchers and other militant infrastructure. Its reported targeting could not be independently verified. The Gaza Health Ministry says more than 7,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war in less than three weeks, a figure that includes the disputed toll from an explosion at a hospital. That is more than three times the number of Palestinians killed in the six-week-long Gaza war in 2014. The ministry’s toll includes more than 2,900 minors and more than 1,500 women. On Wednesday, the wife, son, daughter and grandson of Wael Dahdouh, a veteran Al-Jazeera correspondent in Gaza, were killed in an Israeli strike. Dahdouh and other mourners attended the funerals on Thursday wearing the blue flak jackets used by reporters in the Palestinian territories. The fighting has killed more than 1,400 people in Israel, mostly civilians slain during the initial Hamas attack, according to the Israeli government. The warning by the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, over depleting fuel supplies raised alarm that the humanitarian crisis could quickly worsen. Israel is still barring deliveries of fuel — needed to power generators — saying it believes Hamas will take it for military use. About 1.4 million of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents have fled their homes, with nearly half of them crowded into U.N. shelters. Hundreds of thousands remain in northern Gaza, despite Israel ordering them to evacuate to the south, saying those who remain might be considered “accomplices” of Hamas. In recent days, Israel has let more than 70 trucks with aid enter from Egypt, which aid workers say is insufficient and only a tiny fraction of what is needed. “This is … a drop in the ocean,” said William Schomburg, an official with the International Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza. “We are trying to establish a pipeline.” More than half of Gaza’s primary health care facilities and roughly a third of its hospitals have stopped",

        "text": "Israelis take cover as a siren warns of incoming rockets fired from Gaza strip, during the funeral of the Israelu man Sagiv Ben Svi, killed by Hamas militants while attending music festival. (AP Photo)   \n         Tel Aviv:  Hamas’s armed wing on Thursday said that ‘almost 50’ Israeli hostages held by its operators in the Gaza Strip have been killed since Israel began bombarding the Palestinian territory. Hamas spokesperson, Abu Ubaida has in a post in the Telegram channel on Thursday said, “Al Qassam Brigade estimates that the number of Zionist prisoners killed in the Gaza Strip as a result of Zionist killings and massacres reached approximately 50 people.” However, there are reports and statements of certain Israeli intelligence operatives that Hamas has executed 50 hostages and have put the blame on Israel.  \n             Hamas had earlier too made similar claim. One week after Hamas’s deadly attack on southern Israel, the terrorist organization claimed that Israeli air strikes killed nine hostages, including four foreign nationals. The statement by Hamas came after Israel said its tanks and infantry launched an overnight raid into Hamas-controlled Gaza. Several militant targets were attacked as a wider ground incursion loomed after more than two weeks of war. Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said it killed deputy head of Hamas intelligence, Shadi Barud, in a strike in the Gaza Strip. IDF accused Barud of planning the October 7 Hamas attacks in southern Israel. The news comes hours after its biggest ground incursion yet into Gaza, with armored bulldozers and tanks. \n             \n           With the looming ground attack, Iran’s foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian warned if Israel’s retaliation against Hamas militants in Gaza does not end then the US will “not be spared from this fire”. “The Islamic Republic of Iran stands ready to play its part in this very important humanitarian endeavor, along with Qatar and Turkey. Naturally, the release of the 6,000 Palestinian prisoners is another necessity and responsibility of the global community,” Amirabdollahian was quoted by Reuters. Israel-Hamas war: What we know so far \n Israel said it conducted a rare “targeted” raid into northern Gaza using tanks overnight before it left the area as part of what it called “preparations for the next stages of combat.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said the country was “getting ready” for a ground invasion, which has been widely expected. \n The United Nations has warned that hospitals in Gaza are on the brink of closing and that its humanitarian efforts may be forced to pause because of a lack of fuel in the enclave. \n President Joe Biden called on Israel to consider a “pause” in its military offensive against Hamas militants to allow aid to enter Gaza as the humanitarian crisis there worsens. \n International calls for a cease-fire have been rejected by Israel, which also angrily denounced U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres over comments about the conflict. \n The Israeli military said it hit 250 targets in Gaza in the last 24 hours — the latest day of an intensive bombing campaign the country says is necessary for its own defense. \n More than 7,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials. In Israel, about 1,400 people have been killed, including 309 members of the military, the Israel Defense Forces said. \n At least 224 people were taken hostage during the Oct. 7 terrorist attack — many of them foreigners.",

Daniel Hagari said on Wednesday that Iran directly aided Hamas ahead of the October 7 attack on southern Israel.   \n         Tel Aviv : The Israeli Defence Forces said that it launched a drone strike against a Hezbollah cell in southern Lebanon, The Times of Israel reported. The Hezbollah cell was reportedly getting ready to launch an anti-tank guided missile attack against a border army position.  \n             The IDF has increased airstrikes against terrorists from Hezbollah who are preparing missile and rocket attacks on northern Israel in recent days. In the midst of the Gaza Strip conflict, the terror group has so far identified 46 members who were killed by Israeli attacks in southern Lebanon. The IDF has also released video of the most recent attack, The Times of Israel reported. The Israel Defence Forces had confirmed a day before that another terror cell in Southern Lebanon was struck near the northern community of Zar’it. According to the IDF, a drone strike and artillery bombardment were both directed at the cell. \n             \n           The head of Lebanon’s Hezbollah also met with top leaders of Palestinian terrorist groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad on Tuesday, according to the Times of Israel. The Israeli publication posted an image tweeted on social media X to show Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, with Hamas deputy chief Saleh al-Arouri, and Islamic Jihad chief Ziad al-Nakhala. The screenshot of the tweet published in the daily read, “Among other topics, discussions regarding the appropriate measures that Resistance Axis members must take to reach a definite victory in Gaza and Palestine took place.” The “Axis of Resistance”, according to the New York Times report is the term used for a regional network of militias in the alliance of Iran, Palestinian militant groups, Syria, Lebanon’s Hezbollah, and other factions. Since the October 7 attack by Hamas terrorists on Israel from Gaza, Hezbollah has been operating freely against Israel along Lebanon’s border with Israel, firing rockets and anti-tank missiles at Israeli towns and army positions and opening fire at troops on a near-daily basis. The IDF has responded by striking the terror group’s cells and posts in southern Lebanon, the Times of Israel said. IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said on Wednesday that Iran directly aided Hamas ahead of the October 7 attack on southern Israel. “Iran directly aided Hamas before the war, with training, supplying weapons, money, and technological know-how,” Hagari said in a press conference. “Even now, Iranian aid to Hamas in the form of intelligence and online incitement against the State of Israel, continues,” the IDF spokesperson was quoted by Times of Israel. Previously, Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Hossein Amir-Abdollahian warned that fighting against Israel might open on “other fronts” if Israel continues its bombardment of Gaza.",

Erdan informed the members that the victim seen in the video was not Israeli or Jewish, but an agricultural worker from Thailand. “One can see a terribly injured civilian – bloodied, yet alive – laying on the ground as a Hamas savage screaming Allahu Akbar repeatedly pummels the man’s neck with a garden hoe in order to decapitate him,” Erdan said at the UN podium.  \n             Notably, the UN General Assembly began a two-day meeting on the Middle East yesterday. The assembly is set to vote today on a resolution drafted by Arab states regarding a ceasefire in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. “The October 7th Massacre and what ensued has nothing to do with the Palestinians, nothing. It has nothing to do with the Arab-Israeli conflict or the Palestinian question. This is not a war with the Palestinians. Israel is at war with the genocidal jihadist Hamas terror organization only. It is the law-abiding democracy of Israel against modern-day Nazis,” Erdan said adding that Hamas has only one goal, which is to murder every single Jew. Israeli Diplomats Placed Print Outs With QR Code At Members’ Seat Each seat in the United Nations headquarters hall with a printout with a QR code titled “Free Gaza from Hamas, scan to see Hamas’ atrocities,” placed there by Israeli diplomats. The QR code linked to a collection of photos and videos from the October 7 attack. \n             \n           Israel Vowed To Eliminate Hamas  In response to the attack that claimed the lives of 1,400 people, Israel has declared its intent to eliminate Hamas, the governing authority in Gaza. Israel has conducted airstrikes on Gaza, enforced a blockade on the territory, and is preparing for a ground invasion. According to Palestinian authorities, the conflict has resulted in more than 7,000 casualties. Jordan’s Foreign Minister Accused Israel Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, who was speaking on behalf of Arab states, accused Israel of “making Gaza a perpetual hell on earth – the trauma will haunt generations to come,” adding that the impact on Palestinian civilians was immense. “I don’t have videos to show you, we respect the dead too much,” Safadi said. Palestinian UN Envoy Said Some Countries Applying Double Standard Advocating for a ceasefire, Palestinian UN representative Riyad Mansour asserted that some nations, which he chose not to identify, were applying an evident double standard. “How can representatives of states explain how horrible it is that 1,000 Israelis were killed, and not feel the same outrage when 1,000 Palestinians are now killed every single day?” Mansour asked the assembly. “Why not feel a sense of urgency to end their killing?”",

According to reports, the area which came under attack is located some 130 km from the Gaza Strip. A witness in Taba confirmed hearing an explosion and seeing smoke rising, Reuters reported, but the news agency was not immediately able to identify the blast’s source.  \n             Colonel (Rtd) Yitchak Bar Shabby of the Israel army told IANS that it was likely to have been fired by Hamas. He however did not rule out the involvement of the Iran-backed Houthi militia. Taba, in Egypt’s Sinai peninsula, is popular with tourists. It is about a three-hour drive from Egypt’s Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh.The Taba explosion highlights the risks facing Egypt and other countries in the region as fighting intensifies between Israel and Hamas.

Israeli military conducts ‘targeted raids’ inside Gaza Strip For a second straight night, Israeli troops conducted “targeted raids” inside the Gaza Strip before withdrawing from the Hamas-controlled enclave, the military said in a statement on Friday. A video published by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) showed tanks and armoured vehicles moving on a road near agricultural land as well as strikes on buildings and open areas, reports CNN. The raid, which included aircraft and artillery strikes in the Shaja’iyah neighborhood, targeted Hamas infrastructure including “anti-tank missile launch sites, military command and control centers, as well as Hamas terrorists”, the IDF said. On Thursday, the IDF had said that it carried out a “targeted raid” in the northern Gaza Strip as “part of preparations for the next stages of combat”, in which the Jewish nation is planning a ground offensive in Gaza, reports Xinhua news agency. During the raid, soldiers located and struck “numerous” militants, infrastructure and anti-tank missile launch posts and “operated to prepare the battlefield”, it added. Israel has vowed to wipe out Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, in response to its October 7 deadly terror attacks and kidnap rampage in which 1,400 people, mostly civilians, were killed and more than 220 taken hostage. In a televised address on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that Israeli is “preparing for a ground incursion,” into Gaza following nearly three weeks of airstrikes on the coastal strip.

        "text": "India Abstains From UN Vote On Israel Which Didn't Mention Hamas Attack; Voices Concern About Crisis    \n         New Delhi:  India on Friday abstained from voting on a resolution in the United Nations that called for an immediate humanitarian truce in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, as it did not make any mention of the terrorist group Hamas.  \n             The resolution calls for an “immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce” in Gaza. It demands that all parties adhere to international humanitarian law and ensure “continuous, sufficient and unhindered” provision of essential supplies and services into the Gaza Strip. It also calls for the “immediate and unconditional release” of all civilians that are held captive while demanding their safety, well-being, and humane treatment in accordance with international law. India’s opposition to the resolution was because it failed to condemn Hamas for its terrorist attack and the Assembly rejected an amendment supported by New Delhi that would have named the terror group. India’s Deputy Permanent Representative Yojna Patel said after the vote, “The terror attacks in Israel on October 7 were shocking and deserve condemnation.”  “The world should not buy into any justification of terror acts. Let us keep aside differences, unite and adopt a zero tolerance approach to terrorists,” she added. India backed the amendment to the resolution moved by Canada that named Hamas and condemned its 7/10 attack, but it failed to pass, getting only 88 votes, while there were 54 votes against it, with 23 abstentions. \n             \n           Why India refused to vote Yojna Patel said, “Terrorism is a malignancy and knows no borders, nationality or race.” The Hamas attacks were “on a scale and intensity that is an affront to basic human values,” she added. “Violence as a means to achieve political objective objectives, damages indiscriminately, and does not pave the way for any durable solutions.” “We hope that the deliberations of this Assembly will send a clear message against terror and violence and expand prospects for diplomacy and dialogue while addressing the humanitarian crisis that confronts us,” she said. “We urge the parties to de-escalate, eschew violence and work towards creating conditions for an early resumption of direct peace negotiations. We hope that the deliberations of this assembly will send a clear message against terror and violence and expand prospects for diplomacy and dialogue, while addressing the humanitarian crisis that confronts us,” India said. Patel also spoke of the toll the conflict in Gaza has taken on civilians and said, “This humanitarian crisis needs to be addressed.” “India is deeply concerned about the deteriorating security situation and astounding loss of civilian lives in the ongoing conflict,” she added. \n #IndiaAtUN \n Ambassador  @PatelYojna , Deputy Permanent Representative, delivered the explanation of India’s vote at the 10th  #UNGA  Emergency Special Session today \n Statement:  https://t.co/6tOLVQnNv4   pic.twitter.com/phbvs5GiP8 \n — India at UN, NY (@IndiaUNNewYork)  October 27, 2023 “Casualties in the ongoing front conflict in Gaza are a telling, serious and continuing concern; civilians especially women and children are paying with their lives,” she said. She also reiterated India’s support for a two-state solution that would have Israel and Palestine living side-by-side as independent, sovereign states. Countries who voted for and against UN Resolution The resolution that passed was proposed by Jordan on behalf of the Arab group and Pakistan, Bangladesh and China were among the co-sponsors. One-hundred and twenty countries voted in favor of the non-binding resolution introduced by Jordan, while just 14 voted against, including the United States, Austria, Croatia, Czechia, Fiji, Guatemala, Hungary, Israel, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Gineau, Paraguay and Tonga. Forty-five countries abstained, including Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Greece, India, Iraq, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, South Korea, Sweden, Tunisia, Ukraine and the UK. Pakistan’s Permanent Representative Munir Akram spoke against the amendment before the vote asserting that it lacked “equity and balance and fairness”. If Hamas should be named, so should Israel, he said, adding that the resolution Islamabad co-sponsored was “circumspect” in not naming either of them. Many countries that voted for the amendment switched to voting for the resolution even without the amendment or abstained, enabling its passage. Britain and France were among the Western countries that made the switch and voted for the resolution. \n USA was one of just 14 countries to vote against a General Assembly Resolution calling for “an immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities.”  pic.twitter.com/mowPZhbk8C \n — Mark Leon Goldberg (@MarkLGoldberg)  October 27, 2023 France’s Permanent Representative Nicolas de Riviere explaining the change said that it sought to enable aid for the civilians of Gaza. He said, “Nothing could justify the suffering of civilians. All of the victims of war are worthy of compassion, all of the lives are equally worthwhile. There’s no hierarchy.” “We have to work collectively to set up humanitarian truce, which could lead eventually to a ceasefire because the situation in Gaza is catastrophic,” he added. Iraq, which voted against the resolution, later said that it was done in error and that it backs it. On the 21st day of the conflict, the 193-member world body adopted the resolution by a vote of 120-14 with 45 abstentions after rejecting a Canadian amendment backed by the United States. India was among the countries that abstained from the vote.",

(AP Photo/Jeenah Moon)   \n         NYC Grand Central Terminal:  New York City’s famed Grand Central Terminal witnessed a massive demonstration during the evening rush hour on Friday as a sea of hundreds of protesters filled its main concourse chanting slogans and unfurling banners demanding a cease-fire as Israel intensified its bombardment of the Gaza Strip. At least 200 of the demonstrators wearing black T-shirts saying “Jews say cease-fire now” and “Not in our name,” were detained by New York Police Department (NYPD) officers and led out of the train station, their hands zip-tied behind their backs. The NYPD said the protesters were taken briefly into custody, issued summonses, and released, and that a more exact number of detentions would be available Saturday morning.  \n             Some protesters hoisted banners as they scaled the stone ledges in front of leaderboards listing departure times. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority asked commuters to use Penn Station as an alternative. After the sit-in was broken up by police, the remaining protesters spilled into the streets outside. “Hundreds of Jews and friends are taking over Grand Central Station in a historic sit-in calling for a ceasefire,” an advocacy group Jewish Voice for Peace said on social media. The scene echoed last week’s sit-in on Capitol Hill in Washington, where Jewish advocacy groups, including Jewish Voice for Peace and If Not Now, poured into a congressional office building. More than 300 people were arrested for illegally demonstrating. \n             \n           Meanwhile, Israel stepped up airstrikes across the Gaza Strip on Friday, knocking out the internet and largely cutting off communication with the 2.3 million people inside the besieged Palestinian enclave. Gaza’s Hamas-run Health Ministry says more than 7,300 people have been killed, more than 60% of them minors and women. The Israeli military’s announcement it was “expanding” ground operations in the territory signaled it was moving closer to an all-out invasion of Gaza, where it has vowed to crush the ruling Hamas militant group after its bloody incursion in southern Israel three weeks ago. More than 1,400 people were slain in Israel during the attack, according to the Israeli government, and at least 229 hostages were taken into Gaza. The UN General Assembly (UNGA) approved a nonbinding resolution calling for a “humanitarian truce” in Gaza leading to a cessation of hostilities. It was the first United Nations response to Hamas’ surprise October 7 attacks and Israel’s ongoing military response. (With AP inputs)",

        "description": "Although India abstained from casting a vote for a non-binding Jordanian resolution, it voted in favor of the Canada-led amendment to the draft resolution on the Gaza crisis, which failed to pass at the UNGA as it did not achieve a two-thirds majority.",
        "text": "India's Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Yojna Patel (Image: ANI)   \n         New York:  During the special session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) that took place on Friday, India emphasized the need for “explicit condemnation of the terrorist attacks by Hamas on October 7,” according to sources familiar with the matter. The UNGA session revolved around addressing a critical issue related to the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.  \n             At the heart of this diplomatic effort, the UNGA adopted a resolution on the same day. This resolution called for an “immediate, durable, and sustained humanitarian truce” between Israeli forces and Hamas militants in Gaza. The primary objective of this truce is to mitigate the hostilities and provide humanitarian relief to the affected population in the region. UNGA Adopts Resolution Moved By Jordan The adopted resolution moved by Jordan, however, did not include any explicit condemnation of the terrorist attacks of October 7. However, an amendment was moved to include this aspect prior to the vote on the main resolution, the source added. UNGA Update: India’s Stance On Israel-Gaza War Although India abstained from casting a vote for a non-binding Jordanian resolution, it voted in favor of the Canada-led amendment to the draft resolution on the Gaza crisis, which failed to pass at the UNGA as it did not achieve a two-thirds majority. India’s vote on the resolution was guided by India’s steadfast and consistent position on the issue. “Our Explanation of Vote (EOV) reiterates this comprehensively and holistically,” sources familiar with the matter told news agency ANI. \n             \n           There can be no equivocation of terror. The EOV categorically states, “The terror attacks in Israel on October 7 were shocking and deserve condemnation. Our thoughts are also with those taken hostages. We call for their immediate and unconditional release.” The EOV strongly conveyed India’s concerns about the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza: “Casualties in the ongoing conflict in Gaza are a telling, serious, and continuing concern. Civilians, especially women and children, are paying with their lives. This humanitarian crisis needs to be addressed. We welcome the international community’s de-escalation efforts and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza. India too has contributed to this effort.” Further added, “We are deeply concerned at the deteriorating security situation and astounding loss of civilian lives in the ongoing conflict. The escalation of hostilities in the region will only exacerbate the humanitarian crisis. It is necessary for all parties to display the utmost responsibility.” India Calls For A Negotiated Two-state Solution to Israel-Palestine Crisis India’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Yojna Patel, said in her speech that explained India’s vote, “India has always supported a negotiated two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine issue leading to the establishment of a sovereign, independent, and viable state of Palestine living within secure and recognized borders, side-by-side in peace with Israel. For this, we urge the parties to de-escalate, eschew violence, and work towards creating conditions for an early resumption of direct peace negotiations.” In the absence of all elements of India’s approach not being covered in the final text of the Resolution, India abstained in the vote on its adoption, according to the source. However, it is pertinent to note that India was in favour of the Canadian resolution which specifically condemned the terrorist attacks by Hamas. UNGA Update: World’s Stance On Israel-Gaza War The Jordanian-led draft resolution was adopted by the General Assembly with 120 votes in favor, 14 against, and 45 abstentions. The 45 nations that abstained from voting on the resolution included Iceland, India, Panama, Lithuania, and Greece. The adoption of the Jordanian resolution is the first formal response of the United Nations to the escalation of violence in Israel and Palestine since the Hamas terror attacks of 7. The voting at UNGA comes at a time when Israel has announced expanding ground operations in Gaza. (With inputs from agencies)",

After Elon Musk acquired Twitter last year and renamed it ‘X’, experts said that the platform has become not just unreliable but actively promotes falsehoods. Earlier, X CEO Linda Yaccarino said that X has removed hundreds of Hamas-affiliated accounts, stating “There is no place on X for terrorist organisations”. “X is committed to serving the public conversation, especially in critical moments like this and understands the importance of addressing any illegal content that may be disseminated through the platform. There is no place on X for terrorist organisations or violent extremist groups and we continue to remove such accounts in real-time, including proactive groups,” said the social media platform’s CEO, Linda Yaccarino.

A sea of people participated in the protest march at New York City’s famed Grand Central Terminal on Friday, demanding a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Protestors were seen holding placards and chanting ‘ceasefire.’ The Grand Central Terminal was shut down due to the protest, as confirmed by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).  \n             Initially, access was limited, but later the MTA decided to close the terminal after the protest intensified. The MTA announced on its website, ‘Grand Central Terminal is closed until further notice due to a protest,’ and requested commuters to consider other stations and anticipate additional travel time.

According to Gaza’s Hamas-run Health Ministry, more than 7,300 people have lost their lives in these attacks, with over 60% of the casualties being minors and women, reported Associate Press. The Israeli military recently announced that it was “expanding” ground operations in the territory, indicating a move closer to a full-scale invasion of Gaza. This comes after their earlier incursion into southern Israel three weeks ago, which resulted in over 1,400 deaths in Israel and the taking of at least 229 hostages into Gaza, as reported by the Israeli government. The U.N. General Assembly approved a nonbinding resolution that called for a “humanitarian truce” in Gaza, with the aim of achieving a cessation of hostilities.

Amid harrowing incidents of kidnapping, being held hostage, torture and death, the  Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu  has said that the second stage of war against Hamas is beginning.  \n             Second Stage Of War Has Begun: Israel PM Netanyahu Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday said that the second stage of the war against Hamas started with the entrance of more ground forces into Gaza on Friday night, The Times of Israel reported. He said that Israel’s goal is to “defeat the murderous enemy and to ensure our existence in our land. His statement comes after the Israel Defence Forces chief has said that the military is carrying out ground operations in the Gaza Strip at present which serve to achieve all the war’s objectives, The Times of Israel reported. Israeli Soldiers’ Goal Is ‘To Defeat Murderous Enemy, To Ensure Our Existence In Our Land’ Netanyahu said that the soldiers are part of a legacy of Jewish warriors that he stressed goes back 3000 years. He said that they have one goal, “To defeat the murderous enemy, and to ensure our existence in our land.” While addressing a press conference in Tel Aviv, he stressed that Israel’s war aims are clear – “destruction of Hamas’s military and governing capabilities; and returning the hostages home.” He said that the decision to start the ground incursion was made unanimously by the war cabinet and the security cabinet, according to The Times of Israel report. He stated, “Our commanders and soldiers fighting in enemy territory know that the nation and the national leadership stand behind them.” He said that the soldiers he has met in the field are determined to make Hamas pay for its actions on October 7. Netanyahu said, “They are determined to eradicate this evil from the world, for our existence and, I add, for all of humanity.” He said, “We always said, ‘Never Again’. Never Again’ is now.” Israel’s PM said his heart is broken after meeting families of kidnapped and pledged to utilize every opportunity to “return our kidnapped brothers and sisters to their families’ embrace.” He called their abduction a “crime against humanity.” \n             \n           ‘Those Who Dare To Accuse Our Soldiers Of War Crimes, Are Hypocrites And Liars’ Benjamin Netanyahu called those who “dare to accuse our soldiers of war crimes” hypocrites and liars. Calling IDF “the most moral army in the world,” he said that the “IDF does everything to avoid harm to non-combatants.” He called on the people of northern Gaza to relocate to the southern Gaza Strip. Netanyahu accused Hamas of war crimes and added that it “uses citizens as human shields” and hospitals as terror headquarters and takes fuel meant for hospitals to supply its war. He said, “Israel is fighting not only its war but humanity’s war against the barbarians,” The Times of Israel reported. He further said, “Our allies in the Western world, and our partners in the Arab world, know that if we do not win, they are next in line in the campaign of conquest and murder from the axis of evil.” He stated that the initial stage was a massive air campaign to allow Israel’s ground forces “to go in as safely as possible.” He stated that Israel destroyed countless headquarters and terrorist infrastructure. This Is Israel’s Second War Of Independence, Says PM Netanyahu Calling it Israel’s “second war of independence”, Netanyahu emphasised that the war will be “long and hard and we are ready.” He said that Israel would fight to defend the homeland and they would not withdraw. He said, “We eliminated countless murderers, including mass murderers. We destroyed countless headquarters and terrorist infrastructure. We are only at the beginning.” He said that Israel would destroy the enemy “above ground and below the ground” and called the war one of “light over darkness, life over death. This is the mission of our lives and my life.” Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu Meets Families Of Hostages On Saturday, Benjamin Netanyahu met representatives of families whose loved ones have been held captive in Gaza. After meeting them, Netanyahu said that Israel “will exercise exhaust every possibility” to bring about their return, The Times of Israel reported. He told the families that freeing the hostages was a chief goal of the war. He said, “The key is the level of pressure.” Netanyahu said, “The greater the pressure, the greater the chances [of freeing the captives]”, The Times of Israel reported. He also told them that there was no avoiding a major ground incursion, including to ratchet up pressure on Hamas. (Inputs from ANI)",

        "text": "'There's Going To Be A Terrorist Attack…' Florida Gov Warns Us Over Open Borders. | Photo: Twitter   \n         Florida:  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has expressed concerns about potential security risks associated with illegal border crossings into the United States. During the Sin City breakfast event, he discussed the possibility of a terrorist attack being linked to individuals who have entered the country illegally. “There’s going to be a terrorist attack in this country that we’re going to be able to trace to somebody coming across the border,” he cites. “Things like terrorism are still very real. It’s even more real when you have an open border that almost eight million people have come across. Do you not think our enemies are exploring that border?” DeSantis added. The event was Sin City breakfast event was sponsored by Never Back Down, a SuperPAC supporting DeSantis presidential campaign.  \n             The Florida Governor further extended his unwavering support for Israel and his strict opposition to the resettlement of Gaza refugees in the United States. Notably, the proposal for the resettlement of refugees from the Gaza Strip has garnered support from some left-wing Democrats. “You have people like AOC and the left-wingers that want the United States to bring in hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Gaza Strip,” he said. I have said we will bring in zero from the Gaza Strip to the United States,” DeSantis added. \n             \n           As the 2024 presidential election season unfolds, DeSantis emphasided the emerging security concerns and increasing partisan divisions. The Florida Gov. also expressed, “They elected Hamas in Gaza. A lot of them were cheering in the streets when the attacks happened. They weren’t Hamas members; they were just normal people, and I remember from 9/11 in 2001, Palestinian Arabs cheering when the twin towers were brought down. That was the worst terrorist attack we ever had, and they were out celebrating.” As the 2024 GOP presidential primary neared the November election, DeSantis found himself falling behind the former President, Donald Trump, who maintained a significant lead in the polls. Trump consistently enjoyed a double-digit advantage over the Florida governor.",

        "description": "Convention Centre Kalamassery Explosion: Till yesterday, there had been one death in the blasts but now there has been a rise in the death toll and one of them is a 12-year-old girl who succumbed to her injuries in the early hours of Monday.",
        "text": "Ernakulam Convention Centre Explosions In Kerala Death Toll Rises Photo PTI   \n         New Delhi:  In Kalamassery, Ernakulam distict of Kerala, a prayer meeting of the Jehovah Community was going on when there were explosions and a fire; injuring several people and also killing a lady. The investigation on these blasts is going on and it was also suspected that it might be a terror attack. The attack comes days after Hamas leader Khaled Mashal virtually participated in an event in Kerala and addressed a protest programme which had been organised by an Islamist group against Israel’s war. In the latest update,the death toll from the blasts at the Christian religious gathering near this port city of Kerala has risen to three, according to an official statement.  \n             Kerala Blasts: 12-Year-Old Girl Succumbs To Her Injuries It was earlier reported that a woman had died in the accident but due to the fire and not the blasts; now, according to the latest report, a 12-year-old girl, identified as Libina from Malayattoor in Ernakulam district, has also succumbed to her injuries in the early hours of Monday at the Kalamassery Government Medical College Hospital. In the statement issued by the hospital’s medical board, the girl was admitted to the hospital on Sunday morning with severe burns covering 95 per cent of her body. Despite receiving ventilator support, her condition continued to deteriorate, leading to her death at 12.40 am, it said. Explosion At Convention Centre In Kalamassery, Death Toll Rises To 3 This marks the third casualty from the blasts at the convention centre. Two women who were part of the gathering had lost their lives on Sunday and now this 12-year-old also lost her life. Weirdly, all three deceased are women. In this unfortunate accident, over 50 individuals were injured, some seriously, during the multiple blasts at the international convention centre in Kalamassery where the followers from the minority Christian group, Jehovah’s Witnesses, had gathered for the final day of a three-day-long prayer meeting. A few hours after the incident, a man claiming to be a member of Jehovah’s Witnesses, surrendered before police in Thrissur district of the state, saying that he carried out the multiple blasts. Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan has also called for an all-party meeting today at 10:00 AM and a 20-member probe team has also been announced by the Chief Minister. In the preliminary invesigation, it has been revealed that the cause of the explosion is an Improvised Explosive Device (IED). A bomb disposal unit of the National Security Guard (NSG) was also sent from Delhi to Kerala and both Mumbai and Delhi Police have been put on high alert.",

        "text": "Kerala Blasts CPI(M) Says Connection With Palestine Must Be Investigated   \n         New Delhi:  Days after the virtual participation of  Hamas leader Khaled Mashal  in an event in Kerala, addressing a protest programme which had been organised by an Islamist group against Israel’s war; there have been two blasts and a fire during a prayer meeting in a  convention centre in Kalamassery, Ernakulam district of Kerala . Till now, three females including a 12-year-old girl have been killed while several others are injured and are being treated in the hospitals. An investigation has begun in this regard,  Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan  has called for an  All-Party meeting  and has also announced a 20-member team for probe; preliminary investigation says that the blasts have been caused by an  IED Device . Amid the discussions and debates regarding the cause of the explosions, the  Communist Party of India (Marxist)  state secretary  M V Govindan  has said that the incident has to be investigated if it has a connection with the Palestine issue.  \n             CPI(M) On Kerala Blasts’ Connection With Palestine “Kalamassery incident should be seen as a very serious incident. In today’s time when the world is expressing solidarity with Palestine, the people of Kerala are standing for the people of Palestine. Whoever takes a stand, capable of diverting attention from it will be dealt with seriously. The state government and the democratically aware people should stand together and condemn this,” M V Govindan said. “We have to investigate if it has a connection with the Palestine issue. When we politically analyse, in such a situation an incident like this is part of terror activity. It should be very seriously investigated. We cannot call it an accident when there are parts of bomb found there. Let’s not approach with a preconceived notion. Let them investigate,” M V Govindan added. Kerala Blasts: Injured, Death Toll The blast killed at three people and left several injured, with six remaining in critical condition. The incident led to heightened security in crowded places in the national capital. The hospitals in Kochi were crowded with distressed and appalled family members as several injured people were undergoing treatment. Man Surrenders Himself, Takes Responsibility Of Blasts A man identified as Dominic Martin, meanwhile, surrendered himself at the Kodakara police station in Thrissur, claiming responsibility for a series of blasts that also left several injured. The police, however, said that they are yet to verify Martin’s claims. In his initial statement on the explosions, Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan had said, “What happened in Kalamassery is very unfortunate. Currently, 41 people are hospitalised, 27 people admitted in Ernakulam Medical College…4 people discharged. 2 people have died, and 5 are critical. A special team led by ADGP Law and Order will be investigating this incident. 20 members will be in the investigating team.” \n             \n           (Inputs from ANI)",

        "description": "External Affairs Minister Jaishankar met families members of Indian nationals who have been sentenced to death in Qatar and assured that 'highest importance to the case'.",
        "text": "Minister of External Affairs of India, Dr S. Jaishankar.   \n         New Delhi:  External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar met with the families of eight Indians who have been sentenced to death in Qatar. In a statement posted on X (formerly Twitter), he emphasized that the government gives the ‘highest importance to the case’ of the detained Indians. Last week, a court in Qatar sentenced eight former Indian Navy personnel to death on charges of alleged spying for Israel, as reported by news agency Reuters, citing sources in India and the Arab nation who are privy to the matter.  \n             “I fully share the concerns and pain of the families,” Jaishankar said in his post. “I underlined that the government will continue to make all efforts to secure their release and will coordinate closely with the families in that regard. \n Met this morning with the families of the 8 Indians detained in Qatar. \n Stressed that Government attaches the highest importance to the case. Fully share the concerns and pain of the families. \n Underlined that Government will continue to make all efforts to secure their release.… \n — Dr. S. Jaishankar (@DrSJaishankar)  October 30, 2023 The Qatari intelligence agency arrested these Indian nationals in August 2022, but charges against them were not officially revealed by either New Delhi or Doha. \n             \n           It is noteworthy that the EAM’s “highest importance” statement comes after the External Affairs Ministry’s earlier statement wherein it stated that India will continue to “extend all consular and legal assistance” to the detained Indians and shall take up the verdict with Qatari authorities as well. What We Know So Far The eight Indians have the option to appeal their death sentences, as previously conveyed by a source familiar with the case to Reuters. However, both the Indian and Qatari foreign ministries have refrained from commenting on the claims made by these sources to Reuters. There has also been no immediate response from the Prime Minister’s office in Jerusalem, which oversees Israel’s intelligence services. According to media reports, the Navy veterans faced espionage allegations related to a submarine program on Israel’s behalf. Qatari authorities have additionally alleged that they possess electronic evidence related to this matter.” These changes help maintain consistency and clarity in the text. Who Are These Navy Veterans The former Indian Navy officers who are facing the death penalty in Qatar are Captain Navtej Singh Gill, Captain Birendra Kumar Verma, Captain Saurabh Vasisht, Commander Amit Nagpal, Commander Purnendu Tiwari, Commander Sugunakar Pakala, Commander Sanjeev Gupta, and Sailor Ragesh. They were arrested by the Qatar intelligence agency on August 30, 2022. Despite their attempts, their bail pleas were dismissed multiple times by Qatari authorities.",

        "description": "The Israeli advances put their forces on both sides of Gaza City and the surrounding areas of northern Gaza.",
        "text": "On Tuesday, Israel Defence Forces in a statement on X said another barrage of rockets just launched at Tel Aviv and central Israel.   \n         KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip:  Israeli troops and armor pushed deeper into northern and central Gaza on Monday, as the U.N. and medical staff warned that airstrikes are hitting closer to hospitals where tens of thousands of Palestinians have sought shelter alongside thousands of wounded. Video obtained by the Associated Press showed an Israeli tank and bulldozer in central Gaza blocking the territory’s main north-south highway, which the Israeli military earlier told Palestinians to use to escape the expanding ground offensive.  \n             When asked whether forces had positioned on the road, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said “we expanded our operations” but would not comment on specific deployments. The video shows a car approaching an earth barrier across the road. The car stops and turns around. As it heads away, the tank appears to open fire, and an explosion engulfs the car. The Gaza Health Ministry later said three people were killed. The Israeli advances put their forces on both sides of Gaza City and the surrounding areas of northern Gaza, in what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a “second stage” in the war ignited by Hamas’ brutal Oct. 7 incursion. Casualties on both sides are expected to rise sharply as Israeli forces and Palestinian militants battle in dense residential areas. \n             \n           Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians remain in the north and would no longer be able to escape if the north-south highway is blocked. Around 117,000 displaced people are staying in hospitals in northern Gaza, alongside thousands of patients and staff, hoping they will be safe from strikes, according to U.N. figures. Most residents heeded Israel’s orders to flee to the southern part of the besieged territory, but many stayed in part because Israel has also bombarded targets in so-called safe zones. The death toll among Palestinians passed 8,000, mostly women and minors, the Gaza Health Ministry said. The toll is without precedent in decades of Israeli-Palestinian violence. More than 1.4 million people in Gaza have fled their homes. Over 1,400 people have died on the Israeli side, mainly civilians killed during Hamas’ initial attack, also an unprecedented figure. Israeli forces appeared to be driving deeper into Gaza from the north. Video released Monday by the military showed armored vehicles moving among buildings and soldiers taking positions inside a house. The military said Monday that overnight its troops had killed dozens of militants who attacked from inside buildings and tunnels, and that strikes had destroyed a building Hamas was using as a staging post. It said that in the last few days, it had struck more than 600 militant targets, including weapons depots and anti-tank missile launching positions. The reports of targeting could not be independently confirmed. Hamas’ military wing said its militants clashed with Israeli troops who entered the northwest Gaza Strip with small arms and anti-tank missiles. Palestinian militants have continued firing rockets into Israel, including toward its commercial hub, Tel Aviv. Also Sunday, the largest convoy of humanitarian aid yet — 33 trucks — entered southern Gaza from Egypt. Relief workers say the amount is still far less than what is needed in the territory, where the population of 2.3 million people has been running low on food, water, medicine and fuel after weeks under Israeli siege. On Saturday, crowds of people broke into four U.N. facilities and took food supplies in what the U.N called a sign that civil order was starting to break down amid increasing desperation. Israel’s siege has pushed Gaza’s infrastructure nearly to collapse. With no central power for weeks, hospitals are struggling to keep emergency generators running to operate incubators and other life-saving equipment. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, has been trying to keep water pumps and bakeries running. Last week, U.N. officials said hunger was growing. The increase in aid trucks came after U.S. President Joe Biden emphasized to Netanyahu “the need to immediately and significantly” increase the entry of humanitarian aid, the U.S. said. Israel also opened two water lines in southern Gaza within the past week, according to the Israeli military body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs. The Associated Press could not independently verify that either line was",

        "title": "Israeli Troops Push Deeper Into Gaza And Free Captive As Fears Rise For Palestinian Civilians",
        "description": "The military said a female soldier captured during Hamas' wide-ranging Oct. 7 attack inside Israel had been released during its ground operation.",
        "text": "John Kirby's remarks come after Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu pushed back on criticism about civilian casualties and said Hamas was preventing civilians from moving to the safe zone in southern Gaza.   \n         KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip:  Israeli troops and tanks pushed deeper into Gaza on Monday, freeing a soldier held captive by Hamas militants and advancing on two sides of the territory’s main city. The U.N. and medical staff warned that airstrikes have hit closer to hospitals where tens of thousands of Palestinians have sought shelter alongside thousands of wounded.  \n             The military said a female soldier captured during Hamas’ wide-ranging Oct. 7 attack inside Israel had been released during its ground operation — the first such rescue since the weekslong war began. The statement provided few details, but said Pvt. Ori Megidish “is doing well” and has met with her family. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed her home in a brief statement, saying “our forces” had freed her from Hamas. He said the “achievement” by Israel’s security forces “illustrates our commitment to free all the hostages.” Hamas and other militant groups are believed to be holding some 240 captives, including men, women and children. Netanyahu has faced mounting pressure to secure their release even as Israel wages a punishing war it says is aimed at crushing Hamas and ending its 16-year rule over the territory. \n             \n           Hamas, which has released four hostages, has said it would let the others go in return for thousands of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, including many implicated in deadly attacks on Israelis. Israel has dismissed the offer. Earlier Monday, Netanyahu had said that the ground invasion “creates opportunities to release hostages.” Hamas released a short video Monday purporting to show three other female captives. One of the women delivers a brief statement — likely under duress — criticizing Israel’s response to the hostage crisis. It was not clear when the Hamas video was made. The Associated Press usually refrains from reporting details of hostage videos because they show individuals speaking under duress and are often used for propaganda purposes. The military has been vague about its operations inside Gaza, including the location and number of troops. Israel has declared a new “phase” in the war but stopped short of declaring an all-out ground invasion, even as it has deployed tens of thousands of troops to the border. The movements of recent days, including larger ground operations both north and east of Gaza City, point to a focus on the city. Israel says much of Hamas’ forces and militant infrastructure, including hundreds of miles (kilometers) of tunnels, are in Gaza City, which before the war was home to over 650,000 people, a population comparable to that of Washington, D.C. Casualties on both sides are expected to rise sharply if Israeli forces expand their ground operation and end up battling Palestinian militants in dense residential areas. Though Israel ordered Palestinians to flee the north, where Gaza City is located, and move south, hundreds of thousands remain, in part because Israel has also bombarded targets in so-called safe zones. Around 117,000 displaced people hoping to stay safe from strikes are staying in hospitals in northern Gaza, alongside thousands of patients and staff, according to U.N. figures. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, says nearly 672,000 Palestinians are sheltering in its schools and other facilities across Gaza, which have reached four times their capacity. The death toll among Palestinians passed 8,300, mostly women and children, the Gaza Health Ministry said Monday. The figure is without precedent in decades of Israeli-Palestinian violence. More than 1.4 million people in Gaza have fled their homes. Over 1,400 people have died on the Israeli side, mainly civilians killed during Hamas’ initial attack, also an unprecedented figure. Video circulating on social media showed an Israeli tank and bulldozer in central Gaza blocking the territory’s main highway, which the Israeli military in recent weeks has suggested Palestinians use to evacuate to the south. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who remain in the north would no longer be able to escape if the road is blocked. The video, taken by a local journalist, shows a car approaching an earth barrier across the road. The car stops and turns around. As it heads away, a tank appears to open fire, and an explosion engulfs the car. The journalist, in another car, races away in terror, screaming, “Go back! Go back!” at an approaching ambulance and other vehicles. The Gaza Health Ministry later said three people were killed in the car that was hit. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, declined to comment on where Israeli forces are deployed. He said additional infantry, armored, engineering and artillery units had entered Gaza and the operations would continue to “expand and intensify.” The military said troops have killed dozens of militants who attacked from inside buildings and tunnels. It said that in the last few days, it had struck more than 600 militant targets, including weapons depots and antitank missile launching positions. Palestinian militants have continued firing rockets into Israel, including toward its commercial hub, Tel Aviv. Hamas said its fighters clashed with Israeli troops who entered the northwest. It was not possible to independently confirm battlefield claims made by either side. Meanwhile, crowded hospitals in northern Gaza came under growing threat. Gaza’s Health Ministry shared video footage that appeared to show an explosion and a column of smoke near the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital for cancer patients. The hospital director, Dr. Sobhi Skaik, said it had sustained damage in a strike that endangered patients. All 10 hospitals operating in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders, the U.N.’s office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs said. Staff have refused to leave, saying evacuation would mean death for patients on ventilators. Strikes hit within 50 meters (yards) of Al Quds Hospital after it received two calls from Israeli authorities on Sunday ordering it to evacuate, the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service said. Some windows were blown out, and rooms were covered in debris. It said 14,000 people are sheltering there Israel says it targets Hamas fighters and infrastructure and that the militants operate among civilians, putting them in danger. Beyond the fighting, conditions for civilians in Gaza are continually deteriorating as food, medicine and fuel run dangerously low amid a weekslong Israeli siege. On Sunday, the largest convoy of humanitarian aid yet — 33 trucks — entered the territory from Egypt. Relief workers say the amount is still far less than what is needed for the population of 2.3 million people. The siege has pushed Gaza’s infrastructure nearly to collapse. With no central power for weeks and little fuel, hospitals are struggling to keep emergency generators running to operate incubators and other life-saving equipment. UNRWA has been trying to keep water pumps and bakeries running. The fighting has raised concerns that the violence could spread across the region. Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah have engaged in daily skirmishes along Israel’s northern border. In the occupied West Bank, Israel said its warplanes carried out airstrikes Monday against militants clashing with its forces in the Jenin refugee camp, the scene of repeated Israeli raids. Hamas said four of its fighters were killed there. As of Sunday, Israeli forces and settlers have killed 123 Palestinians, including 33 minors, in the West Bank, half of them during search-and-arrest operations, the U.N. said.

        "title": "US Says Israel Certainly Making Efforts To Minimise Humanitarian Casualties In Gaza",
        "description": "John Kirby that Netanyahu brings up the issue of civilian casualties in Gaza in conversations with US President Joe Biden.",
        "text": "John Kirby's remarks come after Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu pushed back on criticism about civilian casualties and said Hamas was preventing civilians from moving to the safe zone in southern Gaza.   \n         Washington : Amid intensified war between Israel and Hamas, the White House National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby on Monday (local time) said that he thinks Israel is “certainly” making an effort to minimize humanitarian casualties in Gaza.  \n             He said this while addressing a press briefing on Monday (local time), and added that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has spoken about the efforts that they are making to try to avoid civilian casualties. He noted that there have been civilian casualties amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas and added that the Israel Defence Force’s goal is to go after Hamas terrorists and not after civilians. Asked whether US President Joe Biden feels that Israel abides by the rule of war, Kirby said, “Without getting into, reacting to events on the ground in real-time, which we are just not going to do, this is a conversation we consistently have had with our Israeli counterparts. As you rightly know, that was part of the discussion yesterday with the prime minister, and you heard the prime minister today speaking in Tel Aviv about the efforts that they’re undertaking to try to avoid civilian casualties, and I think that they certainly are making that effort.” “It doesn’t mean that there haven’t been civilian casualties tragically, there have been many, thousands of them, but unlike Putin in Ukraine, and unlike what Hamas did on October 7, killing civilians is not a war aim of the Israeli Defence Forces. Their war aim is to go after Hamas terrorists, terrorists I might add, that are using innocent Palestinians as human shields,” he added. \n             \n           John Kirby that Netanyahu brings up the issue of civilian casualties in Gaza in conversations with US President Joe Biden and that both leaders “recognize that as democracies, it’s important to abide by the law of war, to protect innocent life and to and to try to minimize civilian casualties.” In response to a question on why Biden is repeatedly calling for fighting the war in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law, he said, “Because it is something that even the Prime Minister brings up in the conversation. They both recognize that as democracies, it’s important to abide by the law of war, to protect innocent life and to try to minimize civilian casualties. It’s not a lecturing, it’s a reminder from two leaders of two vibrant democracies, that this is what separates us from folks like Hamas.” He noted that there is not a single conversation that the US has not had with Israeli counterparts to better understand what efforts they are making to minimize civilian casualties. He said that the US is leading the effort to try to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza. “There’s not a single conversation we haven’t had with our Israeli counterparts to better understand what they’re doing to try to minimize civilian casualties and again, as friends can and friends should do with one another, to make sure that we’re on the same page about that,” he said. “And the United States is literally leading the effort to try to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza and if it wasn’t, quite frankly, for American leadership, I don’t think you’d see in fact, I know you wouldn’t see the increase of the aid getting in. Again, we know that there’s a lot that needs to be done. But, it’s because of the American leadership on the ground and American convening power that we are able to get that aid in and …We are really working very hard at this. Every single innocent life lost is a tragedy. Everyone whether it is a Palestinian life lost or an Israeli life lost, everyone should be prevented. There is no reason for these families to keep grieving and we are going to keep doing everything we can to work with Israeli counterparts on the minimisation of civilian casualties,” he added. John Kirby’s remarks come after Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu pushed back on criticism about civilian casualties and said Hamas was preventing civilians from moving to the safe zone in southern Gaza, The Times of Israel reported. While addressing a press briefing, Netanyahu said, “Not a single civilian has to die. Hamas has to merely let them go to the safe zone.” He noted, “Hamas is preventing them from leaving, keeping them in the areas of conflict.” He said the question should be directed to Hamas and added that Israel is “going out of our way” to avoid civilian casualties. “We cannot give immunity to these terrorists… these savages. We have to do everything we can to minimize civilian casualties. But we cannot give up the fight… This is a battle of civilization against barbarians,” he said, according to The Times of Israel report. He spoke about the Royal Air Force bombing of a Gestapo headquarters in Copenhagen in 1944. He said, “The British pilots missed” and hit a children’s hospital nearby which he said caused the death of 84 children. Netanyahu said, “That is not a war crime. That is not something you blamed Britain for doing. That was a legitimate act of war with tragic consequences that accompany such legitimate actions,” The Times of Israel reported. He noted, “And you didn’t tell the Allies, don’t stamp out Nazism because of such tragic consequences… They knew that the future of our civilization was at stake. Well, I’m telling you right now that the future of our civilization is at stake. We have to win this war. We’ll do it by minimizing civilian casualties. And may we succeed.” (With inputs from ANI)",

        "text": "'Not Only False, It Is Outrageous': Netanyahu Rejects Genocide Charges Against Israel   \n         Tel Aviv:  Israel is in the midst of war with the goal of destroying the military and governing capabilities of Hamas, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, adding that the country is doing this “systematically.” Netanyahu said that Israel Defence Forces has expanded its ground incursion in the Gaza Strip. “The first blocking stage is over. The 2nd stage, pounding them from the air is continuing all the time. The 3rd stage – the IDF has expanded its ground incursion inside the Gaza Strip. It is doing so in measured, very powerful, steps making methodical, step-by-step progress.”  \n             He stated that Israel is working to have active deterrence on the northern front. He further said, “I reiterate to Nasrallah: You will be making the mistake of your lives if you decide to fully intervene in the campaign. You will receive a blow that you cannot even imagine.” Netanyahu said that Israel is continuing the efforts to free the hostages and stressed that this campaign will take time. He noted that there will be “losses, difficulties and surprises.” However, Hamas in the end “will be crushed.” According to Israel’s Prime Minister’s Office statement on X, Netanyahu said, “We are continuing the efforts to free the hostages, both with the manoeuvre, which is even creating possibilities of securing release that we will not miss. This campaign will take time.” \n             \n           “There will be pitfalls. There will be difficulties. There will be losses.

We have set the clear goal of destroying Hamas’s military and governing capabilities. We are doing this systematically. https://t.co/THIGdVJNaE \n — Prime Minister of Israel (@IsraeliPM)  October 30, 2023 He stressed that Israel for this needs patience and time and ensuring diplomatic support. Netanyahu said that he is in daily contact with US President Joe Biden and his team is talking with their counterparts constantly.” He said, “We have made it clear that we are fighting not only our war, but their war as well; because if Hamas is not defeated, then the axis of evil will win. And if the axis of evil wins, the free world will lose.” He added, “This effort is also a humanitarian effort. This is true in and of itself, and because it assists our forces. We are trying to move the population to the southern Gaza Strip.” Netanyahu said that Israel has made a safe zone and it is there Israel wants to direct the humanitarian assistance. He said that Israel is doing this in coordination with the US and stressed that the process will take time. At the start of the cabinet meeting, he said that Israel had formed a national emergency government for the war. He noted, “The nation is more united now than it has ever been. There is a fighting spirit among the soldiers; I visit them.” He spoke about meeting Israel Police Unit 33 – the Gidonim. Netanyahu said, “This morning, I was with the Gidonim. Before that, I have been with all of the forces. One simply needs to see them imbued with fire because they understand that we are fighting for our existence, and it is this unity that will be decisive.” Israel Air Forces said that IDF forces have been continuing their ground operations in the Gaza Strip for the past few hours. Meanwhile, The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) on Monday said that a soldier captured by the Hamas terror group has been rescued during ground operations and she is now with her family. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has congratulated the IDF and Shin Bet for this “important achievement” and stressed that the release of the soldier showcases their commitment to the release of all the abductees. According to IDF, Pvt Ori Megidish was abducted by Hamas on October 7. Taking to X, IDF stated, “She is home. PVT Megidish was abducted by Hamas on October 7. Tonight, she was released during ground operations. Ori is now home with her family.” Netanyahu called terrorists of Hamas “monsters” and stated that Israel would continue to hunt them down. He hailed the Shin Bet security agency and IDF for rescuing the soldier captured by Hamas.",

These are meant to protect us from the airplanes,” he said. In the meantime, Hamas militants in Gaza retaliated against the air strikes by Israeli troops into the Gaza Strip’s main city as the war intensified into what the Israeli administration called the ‘second phase’. \n             \n           As per the latest data released by the Gaza health ministry, over 8,300 people died since the war began, of which 3,457 were minors. Earlier in the day, White House National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby on Monday (local time) said that he thinks Israel is “certainly” making an effort to minimize humanitarian casualties in Gaza. While addressing a press briefing on Monday (local time), he said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has spoken about the efforts that they are making to try to avoid civilian casualties. He noted that there have been civilian casualties amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas and added that the Israel Defence Force’s goal is to go after Hamas terrorists and not after civilians. Asked whether US President Joe Biden feels that Israel abides by the rule of war, Kirby said, “Without getting into, reacting to events on the ground in real-time, which we are just not going to do, this is a conversation we consistently have had with our Israeli counterparts. As you rightly know, that was part of the discussion yesterday with the prime minister, and you heard the prime minister today speaking in Tel Aviv about the efforts that they’re undertaking to try to avoid civilian casualties, and I think that they certainly are making that effort.” “It doesn’t mean that there haven’t been civilian casualties tragically, there have been many, thousands of them, but unlike Putin in Ukraine, and unlike what Hamas did on October 7, killing civilians is not a war aim of the Israeli Defence Forces. Their war aim is to go after Hamas terrorists, terrorists I might add, that are using innocent Palestinians as human shields,” he added. John Kirby that Netanyahu brings up the issue of civilian casualties in Gaza in conversations with US President Joe Biden and that both leaders “recognize that as democracies, it’s important to abide by the law of war, to protect innocent life and to and to try to minimize civilian casualties.” In response to a question on why Biden is repeatedly calling for fighting the war in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law, he said, “Because it is something that even the Prime Minister brings up in the conversation. They both recognize that as democracies, it’s important to abide by the law of war, to protect innocent life and to try to minimize civilian casualties. It’s not a lecturing, it’s a reminder from two leaders of two vibrant democracies, that this is what separates us from folks like Hamas.”",

The incident was reported when Louk attended a rave party close to the Gaza border when Hamas terrorists attacked and killed about 260 people.  \n             “Unfortunately we received the news yesterday that my daughter is no longer alive,” Louk’s mother Ricarda told the German outlet RTL. Louk’s family was informed of her death overnight. After the news of Louk’s death, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that it is terrorism and Israel has the right to defend itself. Taking to social media, the German Chancellor wrote, “The news of Shani Lok’s death is terrible. She was brutally murdered like many others. This represents all the barbarity of the Hamas attack, which must be punished. “This is terrorism and Israel has the right to defend itself,” he added. \n             \n           Notably, it was because of her distinctive tattoos and dyed hair, that her mother Ricarda Louk first became concerned about her daughter after seeing her in videos that were becoming viral on the internet. The videos, which went viral on social media immediately, featured a face-down, half-naked woman lying seemingly unconscious in the back of a pickup truck in Gaza filled with armed men, according to The Times of Israel. Although it was apparent at the time that Louk had passed away, the family remained optimistic and held hope. According to The Times of Israel, the family of Shani Louk, received a letter from the Israeli ZAKA rescue service Sunday night saying that a bone from the base of her skull, without which a person cannot survive, had been recovered. They added that it had been genetically tested and determined to have belonged to her. On October 7, Hamas initiated a major attack on the southern region of Israel. Since the assault, Hamas has kidnapped over 200 civilians from Israeli border towns and dragged them across the Gazan border. These include several foreigners and dual citizenship holders. In response, Israeli forces have stepped up their ground offensive in Gaza as part of the military response to the Hamas attacks that officials say killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians, with another 239 people taken hostage.",

        "description": "Last week, the Biden administration seized Kremlin-run websites and charged two RT employees with covertly paying a Tennessee company nearly $10 million for its content.",
        "text": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to visit Israel today, August 17.   \n         The US State Department on Friday announced fresh sanctions on Russian state media, accusing a Kremlin news outlet of working for the Russian military and running fundraising campaigns to pay for sniper rifles, body armour and other equipment for soldiers fighting in Ukraine, an official statement said. While the outlet, RT, has previously been sanctioned for its work to spread Kremlin propaganda and disinformation, the new allegations suggest its role goes far beyond influence operations.  \n             Instead, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that RT is a key part of Russia’s war machine and its efforts to undermine its democratic adversaries. “RT wants its new covert intelligence capabilities, like its longstanding propaganda disinformation efforts, to remain hidden,” Blinken told reporters. “Our most powerful antidote to Russia’s lies is the truth. It’s shining a bright light on what the Kremlin is trying to do under the cover of darkness.” \n             \n           RT has also created websites posing as legitimate news sites to spread disinformation and propaganda in Europe, Africa, South America and elsewhere, officials said. They say the outlet has also expanded its use of cyber operations with a new unit with ties to Russian intelligence created last year. The sanctions announced on Friday target RT’s parent organization, TV-Novosti, as well as a related state media group called Rossiya Segodnya and its general director Dmitry Kiselyov. A third organisation and its leader, Nelli Parutenko, were also sanctioned for allegedly running a vote-buying scheme in Moldova designed to help Moscow’s preferred candidates in an upcoming election. Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova suggested the sanctions against RT were unnecessary because it has already been sanctioned. “I think a new profession should appear in the United States — a specialist in sanctions already imposed against Russia,” she wrote on her Telegram channel. Russia’s global propaganda work is receiving extra scrutiny in the months leading up to the US election. The crowd-sourcing effort ran on Russian social media platforms and sought to raise funds for military supplies, some of which were procured in China, officials said. There were no obvious connections between RT and the fundraising campaign, or any indication that Chinese officials knew their products were being sold to Russia. The list of supplies also included night-vision equipment, drones, radios and generators. RT’s actions show “it’s not just a firehouse of disinformation, but a fully fledged member of the intelligence apparatus and operation of the Russian government,” said Jamie Rubin, who heads the State Department’s Global Engagement Centre. Last week, the Biden administration seized Kremlin-run websites and charged two RT employees with covertly paying a Tennessee company nearly $10 million for its content. The company then paid several popular far-right influencers, whose content often mirrored Russian talking points. Two of the influencers said they had no idea their work was being supported by Russia. This summer, intelligence officials warned that Russia was using unwitting Americans to spread its propaganda by disguising it in English on sites popular with Americans. Officials say Russia seeks to divide Americans ahead of the election as a way of reducing support for Ukraine. Russia’s influence operations also appear designed to support former President Donald Trump, who has criticised Ukraine and the NATO alliance while praising Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

Many of the injured suffered critical wounds to their face, eyes, and limbs and have been hospitalised, the report said. The wave of explosions lasted around an hour after the initial detonations, which took place about 3:45 p.m. local time (1345 GMT). It was not immediately clear how the devices were detonated. Lebanese internal security forces said a number of wireless communication devices were detonated across Lebanon, especially in Beirut’s southern suburbs, leading to injuries. Groups of people huddled at the entrance of buildings to check on people they knew who may have been wounded, the report said.

Hezbollah fired missiles at Israel immediately after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas gunmen on Israel. Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire constantly ever since, while avoiding a major escalation as war rages in Gaza to the south.

        "description": "A pager, also known as a beeper, doesn't really work like your typical phone. It's a wee gadget that runs on batteries and uses radio signals.",
        "text": "Image: Screenhgrab/X   \n         The deadly blasts of pagers used by Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon has turned the spotlight back onto these early-era communication devices. The shocking incidents claimed at least nine lives, and left over 2,700 people, among whom was Tehran’s envoy in Beirut, injured as numerous pagers exploded across the country.  \n             The responsibility for these fatal occurrences is firmly placed on Israel by the Hezbollah, a group backed by Iran, but no official word has been released. Israel, however, remains tight-lipped on the matter. Lebanese press has theorized that a possible hack by Israeli intelligence agencies into the pagers could have caused the batteries to overheat excessively, triggering the blasts. What is a Pager? A pager, also known as a beeper, doesn’t really work like your typical phone. It’s a wee gadget that runs on batteries and uses radio signals. It lets the person know when a message comes through with a beep or a buzz. Depending on the kind of pager you’ve got, it can do a few different things. Some will show you numbers, like a phone number to call back, while others can even handle text messages, like a reminder to “Call Home.” History of Pager in India In the heart of the ’90s, just as India’s economic liberalization was taking off post 1991, the pager made its entrance into the Indian market. Now, the narrative was different as compared to the West, where pagers were primarily considered tools for people in courier services. But in India, it was quite the contrary! Owning a pager in India was a mark of prestige. The speedy adoption of these devices boldly underlined the vast potential India held in the telecom sector. \n             \n           Why is Hezbollah still using It? Pagers are still preferred in regions where cell phone signals falter, preserving the message secrecy. In contrast to today’s GPS and Bluetooth equipped smartphones, people preferring not to be tracked find pagers a worthy alternative, and this is the reason why pagers are still being used by members of Hezbollah are still using it.",

(AP Photo/Hussein Malla)   \n         The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was braced for a response after Hezbollah accused Israel of being behind a wave of exploding pagers that killed at least nine and injured thousands. Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, the IDF’s Chief of Staff, on Tuesday, insisted Israel remains ready “for attack and defence in all arenas” without mentioning the pager attacks which occurred across Lebanon and in parts of Syria. “We will update immediately on any change to (Home Front Command guidelines),” the IDF added.  \n             Lebanon and Hezbollah have both accused Tel Aviv of being behind the attack, with the Lebanese Prime Minister labelling it as “criminal Israeli aggression” and a “serious violation of Lebanese sovereignty”. Hezbollah, whose fighters were injured and killed in the attack, also said it holds the “Israeli enemy fully responsible for this criminal aggression”. “This treacherous and criminal enemy will certainly receive its just punishment for this sinful aggression,” they said in a statement. The US said it was investigating the attacks and denied claims made in Iranian media that it had advanced knowledge of the explosions. “The US was not aware of this incident in advance and, at this point, we’re gathering information,” the State Department said. \n             \n           The White House has urged restraint from Hezbollah and Iran, whose ambassador to Beirut, was hurt in the attack.

The sources, who spoke anonymously, said that “the planes on Thursday dropped about 150 air-to-ground missiles”, adding that the casualties and damage caused by the intensive raids, “the most violent since October 8”, are not yet known, Xinhua news agency reported.  \n             The Israeli military stated that the Air Force had targeted “100 rocket launchers, comprising roughly 1,000 barrels.” Following several hours of intense strikes that started in the afternoon, the Israeli military announced shortly before midnight that the operation had concluded. Lebanese sources reported that approximately 50 Katyusha rockets were fired from southern Lebanon into northern Israel, news agency IANS reported. The exchange of fire took place following two consecutive days of deadly explosions involving pagers and communication devices across Lebanon, reportedly carried out by Israel. These incidents resulted in at least 37 deaths and 2,931 injuries. \n             \n           These developments represent the latest escalation in the ongoing conflict along the Israel-Lebanon border, which began on October 8, 2023, when Hezbollah launched rockets at Israel in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. This prompted retaliatory Israeli artillery fire and airstrikes into southeastern Lebanon. The conflict has already resulted in significant casualties and displaced tens of thousands on both sides.",

        "text": "Israel pledges to \"eliminate Hezbollah threat\" following assassination of top commander   \n         Tel Aviv:  Israel vowed to “remove the threat” of Hezbollah’s capabilities and continue its operation to protect its people. This comes hours after Israel Defense Forces (IDF) neutralized the head of Hezbollah’s Operations Unit, Ibrahim Aqil. In a statement shared on X, the IDF confirmed that it had killed senior Hezbollah military figure Ibrahim Aqil. The IDF soldiers also eliminated several senior operatives from Hezbollah’s Operations Staff and commanders from the Radwan Unit.  \n             It said that Ibrahim Aqil and Radwan commanders were planning Hezbollah’s “Conquer the Galilee” attack plan. Taking to X, the IDF stated, “Ibrahim Aqil, the head of Hezbollah’s Operations Unit and the Commander of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan forces, was eliminated in a targeted in an intelligence-based strike in Beirut earlier today. During the strike, senior operatives in Hezbollah’s Operations Staff and commanders from the Radwan Unit were eliminated alongside Aqil.” “Ibrahim Aqil and the Radwan commanders who were eliminated today were planning Hezbollah’s ‘Conquer the Galilee’ attack plan, in which Hezbollah intended to infiltrate Israeli communities and kidnap and murder innocent civilians in a similar manner to the October 7 Massacre. The IDF will continue to remove the threat of Hezbollah’s capabilities and will continue to operate in all arenas to protect Israeli civilians,” it added. \n             \n           IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that Hezbollah has fired over 8,000 rockets, missiles and explosive UAVs at Israeli civilians, forcing more than 60,000 Israelis to evacuate from their homes. Calling Hezbollah a terrorist organisation, Hagari said, “Hezbollah is an internationally recognised terrorist organization. It is a threat to the people of Israel, the people of Lebanon, the Middle East and the entire world. Since October 8, the Hezbollah has fired over 8,000 rockets, missiles and explosive UAVs at Israelis civilians, forcing over 60,000 Israelis to evacuate from their homes. Just today. Hezbollah fired over 200 rockets at Israel.” He also confirmed the killing of Ibrahim Aqil in a targeted strike in Beirut. He called Aqil a principal member of Islamic Jihad, which he called Hezbollah’s terrorist cell that claimed the bombings of the US Embassy in Beirut in 1983. Announcing the killing of Aqil, he said, “The Israel Defence Forces has a duty to defend the people of Israel and ensure their safe and secure return to their homes in northern Israel. Today, in pursuit of that goal, the IDF conducted a targeted strike in Beirut on senior terrorist Ibrahim Aqil, the head of Hezbollah’s Operations Unit and the Commander of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan forces. I can now confirm that Ibrahim Aqil was eliminated together with other senior terrorists in Hezbollah Radwan forces.” “Ibrahim Aqil had the blood of many innocent people on his hands. Israelis. Americans. French, Lebanese and more. During the 1980s, Aqil was a principal member of Islamic Jihad organisation, Hezbollah’s terrorist cell, that claimed the bombings of the US Embassy in Beirut in April 1983, which killed 63 people, and the US Marine barracks bombing in October 1983, which killed 241 US personnel. Ibrahim Aqil also directed the kidnapping of Americans and Germans in Lebanon,” he added. Hagari further said that Aqil and the commanders of the Radwan forces at the time of the strike were gathered underground under a residential building in Beirut’s Dahiyeh. He said that they were planning more terrorist attacks against Israelis. Admiral Daniel Hagari said, “At the time of the strike. Aqil and the commanders of the Radwan forces were gathered underground under a residential building in the heart of the Dahiyeh in Beirut, hiding among Lebanese civilians, using them as human shields. They were in the middle of planning more terror attacks against Israeli civilians. We are determined to fulfill our mission protecting the people of Israel and fulfilling our goal of bringing our hostages home and ensuring and enduring defeat of Hamas in Gaza.” Earlier on September 19, Israel Defence Forces (IDF) launched targeted strikes against Hezbollah terrorist capabilities and infrastructure in Lebanon, aiming to bring security to northern Israel to enable the return of residents to their homes and achieve war goals. Recently, the Israel Defense Forces, commonly known as IDF, posted on X, announcing their plan of focusing attention on Hezbollah territories in Lebanon. Their goal is to dismantle Hezbollah’s terrorist infrastructure and significantly reduce its capabilities. It’s no secret that Hezbollah misuses civilian spaces as cover, building tunnels under them, and also uses civilians as a protective shield. This action has, unfortunately, turned southern Lebanon into a battleground. In order to secure northern parts of Israel, IDF’s operations are geared towards ensuring citizens can safely return to their homes whilst achieving military goals. Defence Minister of Israel, Yoav Gallant, on September 18 expressed the dawn of a “new era” in the ongoing conflict, highlighting a strategic attention shift towards the north. Venting in an X post, Gallant said, “A new era in this war has begun – there is a redirection of resources and forces to the northern terrain. Our primary goal is simple: Get folks from northern Israel back home safely. This, undoubtedly, requires some alterations to the existing security landscape.” (with ANI inputs)",

        "text": "Wayanad-born man linked in pager blasts case? Norway, Bulgaria, Lebanon cops on massive hunt - what probe reveals   \n         The incident in Lebanon involving pagers rigged with explosives, which resulted in nearly 20 deaths and injured thousands of Hezbollah members, has garnered significant attention from intelligence agencies worldwide. The event not only provided crucial intel for Israel but also set off a global investigation into how Israeli spy agencies managed to plant explosives in the pagers. Amid the unfolding investigation, the name of Rinson Jose, a Kerala-born individual who is now a Norwegian citizen, has emerged. Rinson Jose, originally from Wayanad in Kerala, reportedly owns a company in Bulgaria that has been linked to the supply of the pagers to the militant group Hezbollah. This revelation has led to further scrutiny of his business activities.  \n             \n \n \n \n Rinson Jose, aged 37, is noted to have a professional background in the digital field, with interests in automation, marketing, and artificial intelligence (AI), as mentioned on his LinkedIn profile. The investigation into his involvement has intensified, with authorities keen to understand the extent of his company’s role in this complex and deadly operation.     \n Where is Rinson Jose? \n Rinson Jose, who moved to Norway for higher studies and has worked in digital customer support for DN Media, is currently on an overseas work trip and has been unreachable for the past few days. His relatives, including his twin brother in London, expressed concern over his lack of contact, emphasizing their trust in his character and suggesting he may have been inadvertently caught up in the recent events surrounding the pagers and the explosions in Lebanon.  \n Jose’s family is worried as they have also been unable to reach his wife in Oslo. They believe he is a straightforward person and would not engage in any wrongdoing. \n             \n            \n “We speak daily over the phone. However, for the last three days, we have had no contact with Jose. He is a straightforward person and we trust him fully. He will not be part of any wrongdoing. He may have been trapped in these blasts,” Thankachen, a relative of the 37-year-old, told the news agency IANS on Friday.  \n Companies involved in the pager blasts \n The investigation into the explosion of pagers in Lebanon has uncovered a complex network of companies and alleged espionage activities. Preliminary findings indicate that the pagers were supplied to Hezbollah by Norta Global Limited, a Bulgarian company owned by Rinson Jose. Registered in April 2022, Norta Global Ltd is currently under scrutiny by the Bulgarian State Security Agency, which is collaborating with the Interior Ministry to determine the company’s involvement in the bombings.  \n Further complicating matters, it appears that the pagers were not directly imported into Bulgaria. Reports suggest that BAC Consulting, a shell company based in Hungary and believed to be associated with the Israeli spy agency Mossad, acted as an intermediary. Hungarian authorities had previously expressed concerns about BAC Consulting, noting that it lacks a physical office or manufacturing facility.  \n BAC Consulting is said to have facilitated the production of thousands of pagers for the Taiwanese company Gold Apollo, with some of these pagers reportedly intended for Hezbollah earlier this year. The use of shell companies is thought to be a strategy to obscure the identities of those behind the operations.  \n While international media have speculated about Mossad’s involvement in these activities, Israel has yet to officially comment on the situation.",

The death toll far surpassed that of Beirut’s devastating port explosion in 2020, when hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse detonated, killing at least 218 people and wounding more than 6,000. \n             \n           In a recorded message, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Lebanese civilians to heed Israeli calls to evacuate, saying “take this warning seriously.” “Please get out of harm’s way now,” Netanyahu said. “Once our operation is finished, you can come back safely to your homes.” The Israeli military said Monday evening it had carried out a targeted strike in Beirut. It did not give details. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported the Beir al-Abed neighborhood in southern Beirut was hit with three missiles. Hezbollah’s Al-Manar TV said six people were wounded. The area was cordoned off and journalists were not allowed access. Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad told a news conference in Beirut the earlier strikes hit hospitals, medical centers and ambulances. The government ordered schools and universities to close across most of the country and began preparing shelters for people displaced from the south. The Israeli military announced it hit some 800 targets, saying it was going after Hezbollah weapons sites. Some strikes struck residential areas in the south and the eastern Bekaa Valley. One hit a wooded area as far away as Byblos in central Lebanon, more than 80 miles (130 kilometers) from the border north of Beirut. The military said it was expanding the airstrikes to include areas of the valley along Lebanon’s eastern border with Syria. Hezbollah has long had an established presence in the valley, where the group was founded in 1982 with the help of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari repeated warnings urging residents to immediately evacuate areas where Hezbollah is storing weapons, including in the valley. The warnings left open the possibility some residents could live in or near targeted structures without knowing they are at risk. Israel’s military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said Israel was preparing its “next phases” of operations against Hezbollah, and that its airstrikes were “proactive,” targeting Hezbollah infrastructure built over the past 20 years. Halevi said more details would be released in the near future, and that the goal was to allow displaced Israelis to return to their homes in northern Israel. (With AP inputs)",

        "text": "Israel plans to intensify attacks on Lebanon after Monday's airstrike killing 356 (Photo Credit- IANS)   \n         Jerusalem:  As the Israel- Palestine war escalates, Israel officially announced its preparation for “the next phases” of the military operation. O n Monday, Israel launched its deadliest airstrike on Lebanon killing at least of 356 people and injuring over 1,246 others. As per the Xinhua news agency reports,  t he death toll from the Israeli airstrikes on Monday included 24 children and 42 women, with many victims still unidentified.  Israel’s sweeping airstrikes across Lebanon have raised the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to a new peak.   \n             This latest surge in hostilities comes on the heels of last week’s mysterious explosions targeting pagers and walkie-talkies throughout Lebanon, which left several dead and a nation on edge.  The rapid succession of events has catapulted the long-simmering tensions to unprecedented levels, raising fears of a broader regional conflagration.  Herzi Halevi, Israel’s military chief, announced on Monday evening that the country was preparing for “the next phases” of its military operation, as the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) targeted approximately 1,100 sites in southern and eastern Lebanon.  “This morning, the IDF launched a proactive offensive operation,” Halevi said during a situational assessment at the IDF Headquarters Underground Operations Center in Tel Aviv.  “We are targeting combat infrastructure that Hezbollah has been building for the past 20 years,” Halevi noted, adding, “We are striking targets and preparing for the next phases.”  Also on Monday, Israeli airstrikes in Beirut targeted Ali Karki, a senior Hezbollah commander, who was called by Israeli media the “last deputy” of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Hezbollah later said he was “in full health and has moved to a safe place.”  \n             \n           Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was acting to change the “security balance” in the north. He also issued a stark warning to Nasrallah during a security assessment meeting on Monday, stating that “everyone is in the crosshairs.”  Widespread destructions caused in Lebanon amid Israeli airstrikes The strikes have caused widespread destruction and displacement in Lebanon, with residents fleeing from cities such as Tyre, Nabatieh, and Iqlim al-Tuffah towards Beirut and Mount Lebanon.  Syrian media reported a significant movement of people fleeing from Lebanon into Syria at the Syrian-Lebanese border.  Jordan’s Civil Aviation Regulatory Commission announced that it has suspended flights of Jordanian airlines to Beirut until further notice, citing increasing regional tensions and the need to ensure safety and security in civil aviation.  Hezbollah’s brutal response to Israeli Airstrikes In response to the Israeli attacks, Hezbollah fired over 180 rockets toward northern Israel throughout Monday, the Israeli military reported. Israel’s aerial defence systems intercepted some projectiles, while others fell within Israeli territory, causing fires.  The Magen David Adom rescue service reported that five people were injured by shrapnel.  Hezbollah said in a statement that it had bombed several Israeli military targets, including the reserve headquarters of the Israeli army’s northern corps and Rafael’s military-industrial complexes north of Haifa, “with dozens of missiles.” Defence Minister Yoav Gallant urged the public to remain calm in anticipation of potential escalated attacks by Hezbollah in the coming days. “These are days in which the Israeli public will have to show composure,” he noted in a video statement.  The Israeli Defence Ministry also announced a “special” security situation across the entire country on Monday night, amid concerns that Hezbollah might broaden the range of its retaliatory attacks.  The attacks have prompted condemnations from both regional and international communities.  Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the Israeli attacks, describing them as “a war of extermination” during a cabinet meeting. He called on the United Nations and the international community to “stand up and deter aggression.”  The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also condemned the Israeli attacks, describing them as a “flagrant violation of international law” and a threat to regional stability driven by the “far-right goals of the Israeli government”. Nations raise concerns over Israel’s attack  Egypt on Monday condemned Israel’s attacks on Lebanon, warning that its military escalation will only aggravate the crisis. In a statement, the Egyptian foreign ministry urged international powers and the UN Security Council to intervene to stop Israel’s escalation in the region.  Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Nasser Kanaani warned of the serious consequences of Israel’s “bids to expand the conflict in the entire West Asia region”, while the Turkish Foreign Ministry stated that the attacks “mark a new phase in Israel’s efforts to drag the entire region into chaos”.  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed “grave alarm” over the escalating tensions in the region and voiced serious concern for the safety of civilians, including UN personnel. He urged immediate de-escalation and a diplomatic solution to the crisis. (With inputs from IANS)",

(AP Photo/Baz Ratner)   \n         Beirut:  The exchange of fire is going on unabatedly between Israel and Hezbollah even as Lebanon saw the deadliest day on Monday, September 23 since the 2006 war between the two parties.  \n             The conflict has worsened on Tuesday, 24 September 2024 as the death toll from a massive Israeli bombardment climbed to nearly 560 people and thousands of residents have been forced to flee from southern Lebanon. In fact, the two sides are on the brink of an all-out war. Families displaced in Beirut and the coastal city of Sidon found refuge in shelters quickly established in schools. As hotels filled up rapidly or charged rates too high for many, those unable to secure shelter resorted to sleeping in their vehicles, public parks, or by the seaside. \n             \n           Issa Baydoun, member of one of the displaced families, said that they fled the village of Shihine in southern Lebanon when it came under bombing and came to Beirut in a convoy of cars with his extended family. They slept in the vehicles on the side of the road after discovering that the shelters were full. “We struggled a lot on the road just to get here,” he said. Baydoun rejected Israel’s contention that it hit only military targets. “We evacuated our homes because Israel is targeting civilians and attacking them,” he said. “That’s why we left our homes, to protect our children.” Numerous sympathizers have posted messages on social media offering vacant apartments or rooms in their homes, and volunteers have established a kitchen at an unused gas station in Beirut to prepare meals for those displaced. Hezbollah announced it had launched missiles at eight locations in Israel overnight, targeting an explosives factory in Zichron, which is 60 kilometers (37 miles) from the border. The Israeli military reported that on Tuesday morning, 55 rockets were launched from Lebanon into northern Israel, causing fires and property damage. They stated that they had conducted numerous airstrikes on Hezbollah targets, including a unit responsible for firing rockets overnight, and that tanks and artillery had engaged targets in the vicinity of the border.

Those families here today and those in Israel.” He also asserted the need to defeat Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon. “This war can come to an end now, all that has to happen is for Hamas to surrender, lay down its arms and release all the hostages. But if they don’t, we will fight until we achieve total victory. There is no substitute for it. Israel must also defeat Hezbollah in Lebanon,” he added. Netanyahu said Israel has brought home 154 of these hostages, including 117 alive, and pledged to not rest until all the hostages are brought home. He pointed out the hostage families in attendance and asked them to stand up. He narrated the stories of each of the hostages represented by their families, including those whose bodies were taken to Gaza. “I can promise you, we will return your loved ones home. We will not spare that effort until that holy mission is accomplished,” he said. At the start of his address, Netanyahu said that he did not intend to participate in the UNGA. However, he decided to come here as he heard the “lies and slanders levelled by many speakers at this podium.” He said, “I didn’t intend to come here this year. My country is in war fighting for its life. But, after I heard the lies and slanders levelled at my country by many of the speakers at this podium. I decided to come here and set the record straight. I decided to come here to speak for my people, for my country, to speak for truth and here is the truth – Israel seeks peace, Israel yearns for peace, Israel has made peace and will make peace again.” “Yet, we face savage enemies who seek our annihilation and we must defend ourselves against these savage murderers. Our enemies seek not only to destroy us. They seek to destroy our common civilisation and return all of us to a dark age of tyranny and terror,” he added.",

        "text": "Tel Aviv:  Israel on Friday conducted a precision strike targeting Hezbollah’s main headquarters, which was concealed beneath residential buildings in Beirut’s Dahieh district. In a post on X(previously Twitter), the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) wrote, “The IDF conducted a precise strike on the Central Headquarters of the Hezbollah terrorist organisation, embedded under residential buildings in the heart of the Dahieh in Beirut.  \n             “Hezbollah has over 150,000 rockets, meant to kill Israeli civilians, some are strategically placed beneath civilian populations.

After almost a year of Hezbollah firing rockets and missiles at Israeli civilians; after almost a year of Israel warning the world and telling them that Hezbollah must be stopped, Israel is doing what every sovereign state in the world would do… taking the necessary action to protect our people so that Israeli families can live in their homes, safely and securely.” An Israeli official, according to a CNN report, revealed that Friday’s explosions in Beirut were aimed at targeting Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. A senior Israeli official said it is “too early to say” whether Friday’s strike targeting Nasrallah was successful. The official added, “it’s a question of time…,” drawing parallels with the operation that eliminated Hamas leader Mohammed Deif in Gaza. The official further said the decision to target Nasrallah was a “very tough call,” and said confirmation could come at any moment, noting it “depends on the intelligence, they usually try to hide it,” CNN reported. When asked whether Nasrallah is alive or dead, a Lebanese security official told CNN, “We wait.” Also, Lebanon’s Health Ministry reported that the Israeli strikes on Beirut’s Dahieh resulted in two casualties and dozens injured. Notably, Israel has continued striking Hezbollah in Lebanon to counter the ‘threats’, the Iran-backed group poses to Israel with repeated strikes in northern Israel, news agency ANI reported. As the conflict heads towards escalation, all major countries have called for a ceasefire and hostage deal, while also stressing for a two-state solution as a means to achieve durable and sustainable peace in the region.

        "description": "Blinken, speaking hours after a major Israeli strike in Lebanon targeted Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, made a forceful plea for diplomacy in the Middle East, saying that while Israel has the right to defend itself, \"the way it does so matters\".",
        "text": "\"She has a backbone like a ramrod, she has a moral compass of a saint,\" said President Biden pitching Kamala Harris. (Photo Credit- IANS)   \n         Washington:  US President Joe Biden has said he is waiting for more information before commenting on Israel’s airstrikes in Beirut, reiterating that the US was not involved in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) operation.  \n             “We’re still gathering information, I can tell you — the US had no knowledge of or participation in the IDF action. We’re gathering more information. I’ll have more to say when we have more information,” Biden told reporters traveling with him in Delaware. CNN reported earlier on Friday that, according to a US official, Israel informed the US of the operation once it was already underway and Israel had planes in the air. “We had no foreknowledge of this and that does not qualify as a heads up,” the official said. An Israeli official told CNN the notification was sent “shortly before” the strike, and the US did not play a role in the operation. Pressed if he believed the strikes — which CNN has reported were targeting Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah — were justified, Biden declined to comment on it. “We have to get more detail, he said. \n             \n           “I don’t know enough to answer that question.” He said he’s “always concerned,” about the conflict escalating tensions in the region. Earlier, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also said on Friday that the US is still trying to learn more about the Israeli strikes in Beirut. “We are still gathering information, making sure that we fully understand what happened, what the intent was — and until we have that information, I can’t address in detail our response to it, so we’ll continue to work on that in the hours ahead,” Blinken said at a news conference on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. The top US diplomat again stressed the need to pursue a diplomatic solution to the tensions in the region and to avoid a wider war. Blinken, speaking hours after a major Israeli strike in Lebanon targeted Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, made a forceful plea for diplomacy in the Middle East, saying that while Israel has the right to defend itself, “the way it does so matters”. “The choices that all parties make in the coming days will determine which path this region is on, with profound consequences for its people, now and possibly for years to come,” Blinken said at a news conference on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. He warned that not pursing diplomacy would lead to “more conflict, more violence, more suffering, and greater instability and insecurity, the ripples of which will be felt around the world”. The top US diplomat claimed that a path to diplomacy still exists, though it “may seem difficult to see at this moment”. “In our judgment, it is necessary and we will continue to work intensely with all parties to urge them to choose that course,” he said. Blinken’s comments also come days after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaled his unwillingness to agree to a ceasefire proposal championed by the US. Blinken also echoed Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin’s recent comments warning other parties in the region such as Iran not to use the escalation between Israel and Lebanon to target US assets in the region.",

        "description": "The attack took place as the IDF intensified its operations against Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed group that has been consistently targeting Israel.",
        "text": "Hezbollah Chief Hassan Nasrallah is believed to have been killed in targeted Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) airstrikes on Hezbollah’s central headquarters in Beirut on Friday, as reported by unnamed Israeli officials. An Israeli official told the  Jerusalem Post , “Hard to believe he [Nasrallah] got out of it alive,” suggesting that Nasrallah was one of the intended targets of the strikes.  \n             Reports also suggest that Zainab Nasrallah, the daughter of Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike targeting Hezbollah strongholds in southern Beirut on the same day. The Israeli news channel  Channel 12  reported her death, although there has been no official confirmation from Hezbollah or Lebanese authorities. Zainab was known for her vocal support of Hezbollah and her family’s sacrifices, having previously spoken about her brother Hadi, who was killed by Israeli forces in 1997, according to the  Jerusalem Post . Is Hassan Nasrallah dead or alive? Though the IDF has not confirmed it, AP quoted sources as saying that it was targeting Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. It is not yet known if he was at the headquarters, and the Hezbollah has not commented on the attacks either. Reuters  quoted a source close to Hezbollah as saying that Nasrallah was unreachable following the airstrikes, but is believed to be alive. Though Iran’s Tasnim news agency has said that Nasrallah is safe, a senior Iranian security official told  Reuters  that Tehran was “checking his status”. \n             \n           The attack took place as the IDF intensified its operations against Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed group that has been consistently targeting Israel. This escalation is part of a limited cross-border conflict between the IDF and Hezbollah that has persisted over the past year, concurrent with the ongoing war in Gaza. IDF’s warning for airstrike \n On Saturday, the IDF warned the residents of neighbourhoods in the Dahieh of Beirut to move away from Hezbollah assets and facilities. “We will continue operating to precisely dismantle Hezbollah’s offensive capabilities. Hezbollah has strategically embedded weapons in civilian areas, putting Lebanese civilians at risk in order to harm Israeli civilians. Our war is with Hezbollah, not the people of Lebanon,” the Israeli military said in a post on X.  \n The strike in Beirut destroyed six buildings, sending massive orange and black clouds of smoke up into the air. Smoke could be seen for miles, and local news showed the destruction—buildings were turned into rubble, with emergency crews working to put out fires in the debris. The explosion was so powerful it shook windows and homes up to 30 kilometers away. \n Netanyahu cuts US visit short after airstrike on Beirut weakens Hezbollah \n Strong airstrike shook Beirut just a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the United Nations General Assembly. During his speech at the UN, Netanyahu stated that Israel would “keep weakening Hezbollah” until its objectives in Lebanon were achieved. Following the airstrike on Wednesday, Netanyahu cut short his U.S. visit and returned to Israel, according to his office.  \n The Times of Israel  reported that the airstrike in Beirut would not have been authorized without “absolute certainty” regarding Hezbollah Chief Hassan Nasrallah’s presence at the targeted site. Amos Yadlin, speaking to  Channel 12 News , claimed to have sources confirming that Nasrallah “is no longer with us,” though Israel has yet to officially confirm this.  \n Hezbollah, which has Iran’s backing, had been firing rockets into Israel since Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel, in a show of support for the Palestinians. It has led to the IDF hitting back with massive airstrikes in Lebanon, in a bid to push Hezbollah away from the border, while continuing its offensive against the Hamas in Gaza.",

        "text": "Who is Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah? Target of Israel's latest air strikes in Beirut, is he dead or alive?   \n         Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has been at the helm of the Lebanese militant group for the past three decades, significantly strengthening its position as one of the most strongest paramilitary organizations in the Middle East. On Friday afternoon, Israeli airstrikes targeted six buildings in Beirut’s southern suburb of Haret Hreik, marking the largest assault in the Lebanese capital amid nearly a year of ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The Israeli military confirmed that the strikes aimed at Hezbollah’s headquarters in Beirut, resulting in many casualties.  \n             While Israeli media reported that Nasrallah was a target of the strikes, this has not been officially confirmed by Israeli authorities. In response, Hezbollah officials have remained silent. However, a source closed with Hezbollah informed  Reuters  that Nasrallah is alive. Furthermore, a senior Iranian security official mentioned that Tehran is currently verifying his status. Who is Hassan Nasrallah? \n Early Life : Born in 1960 into a poor Shiite family in Beirut’s northern suburb of Sharshabouk; later displaced to southern Lebanon. \n Education : Studied theology and joined the Amal movement, a Shiite political and paramilitary organization. \n Founding of Hezbollah : Became one of the founders of Hezbollah, which was formed by Iranian Revolutionary Guard members in 1982 to fight Israeli forces. \n Iranian Influence : Hezbollah was the first group backed by Iran to export its brand of political Islam. \n Leadership Transition : Chosen as Hezbollah’s secretary-general in February 1992, following the death of its leader, Sayyed Abbas Musawi, in an Israeli airstrike. \n Terrorist Designation : The United States designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization in 1997. \n Withdrawal of Israeli Troops : Credited with leading the war of attrition that resulted in Israel’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000 after an 18-year occupation. \n Personal Loss : His eldest son, Hadi, was killed in 1997 while fighting Israeli forces. \n Iconic Status : Gained iconic status in Lebanon and the Arab world post-Israel’s withdrawal, with messages broadcasted through Hezbollah’s radio and satellite TV. \n Involvement in Conflicts : Under Nasrallah’s leadership, Hezbollah fought multiple wars against Israel and participated in the Syrian conflict, supporting President Bashar Assad. \n Strategic Alliances : Established alliances with Shiite leaders in Iran and Palestinian groups like Hamas. \n Cultural Influence : Idolized by Lebanese Shiite followers and respected across the Arab and Islamic world; holds the honorific title of sayyid, indicating his lineage to the Prophet Muhammad. \n Leadership Style : Considered a pragmatist compared to earlier militant leaders, focusing on strategic governance and military engagement. \n Nasrallah’s role in the current conflict A day after the Israel-Hamas war started on Oct. 7, Hezbollah began attacking Israeli military posts along the border calling it a “backup front” for Gaza. In speeches throughout the conflict, he has argued that Hezbollah’s cross-border strikes had pulled away Israeli forces that would otherwise be focused on Hamas in Gaza and insisted that Hezbollah would not halt its attacks on Israel until a cease-fire is reached in Gaza. \n             \n           Nasrallah has maintained a defiant tone, even as tensions rose dramatically in recent weeks with Israel announcing a new phase in the conflict intended to push Hezbollah back from the border to allow thousands displaced from northern Israel to return.",

        "text": "BIG BREAKING: Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah killed in Lebanon airstrikes, confirms Israel   \n         The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) on Saturday claimed that Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah, was killed in a massive airstrike in Beirut, Lebanon. Nasrallah, known for being an elusive figure, has been a key leader of Hezbollah, a militant group and political party in Lebanon that has been involved in numerous conflicts with Israel. The claim by the IDF, if verified, would mark a significant development in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. However, there has been no independent confirmation of Nasrallah’s death yet, and Hezbollah has not released an official statement regarding this claim.  \n             Hezbollah on Saturday said that since Friday night, there has been no communication with the organization’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, AFP reported quoting sources. The source, said, “Contact with Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has been lost since Friday evening.” “The IDF spokesman announces that yesterday, the IDF killed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the terrorist organization Hezbollah and its founders, along with Ali Karchi, the commander of the southern front in Hezbollah, and other commanders in Hezbollah,” the tweet by IDF roughly said. \n דובר צה״ל מודיע כי אתמול, צה״ל חיסל את חסן נסראללה, מנהיג ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה וממייסדיו, ויחד איתו את עלי כרכי, מפקד חזית הדרום בחיזבאללה, ומפקדים נוספים בחיזבאללה >> \n — צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline)  September 28, 2024 \n             \n           “Hassan Nasrallah is dead,” military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani announced on X. Military spokesman Captain David Avraham also confirmed to AFP that the Hezbollah chief had been “eliminated” following strikes Friday on the Lebanese capital. The strike, which also killed Ali Karki, the Commander of Hezbollah’s Southern Front, was carried out by Israeli Air Force (IAF) fighter jets at the group’s Central Headquarters, reportedly located underground beneath a residential building in the Dahieh area. The strike was conducted after Israel had precise intelligence indicating that senior Hezbollah commanders were present at the location, actively planning terrorist activities against Israel.

The strikes, which Israel claimed were aimed at Hezbollah’s headquarters, caused widespread panic as families fled the bombardment in the Dahiyeh suburbs, a densely populated area known for being a Hezbollah stronghold.  \n “Following precise intelligence from the IDF and Israeli security establishment, IAF fighter jets conducted a targeted strike on the Central Headquarters of the Hezbollah terrorist organization, which was located underground embedded under a residential building in the area of Dahieh in Beirut. The strike was conducted while Hezbollah’s senior chain of command were operating from the headquarters and advancing terrorist activities against the citizens of the State of Israel,” IDF said in a statement.  \n Israeli television networks suggested that Nasrallah was the intended target of these airstrikes. However, a source close to Hezbollah earlier stated that Nasrallah was “fine,” indicating he was not harmed. The explosions were described as the most intense in Beirut since the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.  \n In the aftermath of the major raids, Israel issued warnings early Saturday for residents to evacuate the Dahiyeh suburbs, raising concerns of further escalation in the conflict.",

        "text": "This man will lead Hezbollah after death of Hasan Nasrallah in Beirut airstrike (Photo Credit: X@SH_NasrallahEng_   \n         Beirut : The Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah on Saturday announced that its leader, Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah was “martyred in a criminal attack” on the southern suburbs of Beirut, late Friday evening. “Our leadership is committed to continuing the jihad against the enemy and supporting Gaza and defending Lebanon and its steadfast nation,” the organisation said in a statement, news agency IANS reported. Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah’s death creates a significant void within the organization, which has already experienced substantial leadership losses following months of targeted Israeli strikes against its ranks.  \n             \n \n \n \n However, Nasrallah’s death signifies the loss of not just a figurehead but also the individual who represented the Lebanese Shia movement for both its supporters and the broader region. In 1992, Nasrallah ascended to the role of secretary-general of Hezbollah while still in his 30s. Finding a successor of comparable stature will be a challenge for Hezbollah as it prepares for ongoing Israeli assaults and the potential for a ground invasion of southern Lebanon.     \n Following Hassan Nasrallah’s death, these two leaders are possible contenders for Hezbollah’s next chief. Read here.  \n Hashem Safieddine \n According to a report in Al Jazeera, the head of Hezbollah’s executive council and a cousin of Nasrallah, Safieddine is widely regarded as the frontrunner to become the movement’s next secretary-general. Safieddine, who hails from the southern village of Deir Qanoun en-Nahr near Tyre, was born in 1964 into a Shia family. He pursued his theological studies alongside Nasrallah at two key centers of Shia religious education: Najaf in Iraq and Qom in Iran. Both of them became involved with Hezbollah during the organization’s early development. \n             \n            \n Safieddine has strong connections to Iran; his son, Redha, is married to the daughter of Qassem Soleimani, the prominent Iranian general who was killed in a U.S. strike in 2020.  \n Naim Qassem \n At 71 years old, he serves as Hezbollah’s deputy secretary-general and is frequently referred to as the movement’s “number two.” In the 1970s, Qaseem joined the late Imam Musa al-Sadr’s Movement of the Dispossessed, which eventually merged into the Amal Movement, a Shia organization in Lebanon. In 1991, Qassem was elected deputy secretary-general in 1991, under then-Secretary-General Abbas al-Musawi.",

        "text": "New Delhi:  Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah chief since 1992, was killed on Friday, September 27 in an Israeli airstrike that targeted an underground bunker located over 60 feet underground in Beirut, Lebanon. The attack, carried out by the Israeli Air Force, resulted in the death of several senior Hezbollah officials alongside Nasrallah.  \n             Among the assumptions and mystery around his killing, some insider reports suggest that a third country, apart from Lebanon and Israel, had collected detailed information about Nasrallah’s exact location and other vital details leading to the fatal blow to Hezbollah. The insider reports claim that it was an Iranian infiltrator among the militant group who was passing on every detailed information to Israel. It is also being claimed that the same network of Israeli moles that enabled causing explosions in thousands of pagers, walkie-talkies, TV sets, and solar panels inside Lebanon. This cemented the fact that the Israeli intelligence network has penetrated deep inside Lebanon and Hezbollah. According to French newspaper Le Parisien, an Iranian mole had informed Israel about the location of Nasrallah ahead of the strike. Nasrallah had been attending a meeting with several top members of the group when missiles stuck its underground headquarters in Beirut. \n             \n           What has provided credibility to the claim is the further Israeli attacks on dozens of fresh Hezbollah targets in Lebanon on Sunday, 29 September 2024 in which a senior Hezbollah commander Nabil Kaouk was killed. According to other reports, Zainab Nasrallah, the daughter of Hassan Nasrallah, was also killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Beirut on Friday, September 27.",

        "text": "US Approves $20 Billion In Weapons Sales To Israel Amid Threat Of Wider Middle East War   \n         The U.S. has approved $20 billion in arms sales to Israel, including scores of fighter jets and advanced air-to-air missiles, the State Department announced Tuesday. Congress was notified of the impending sale, which includes more than 50 F-15 fighter jets, Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles, or AMRAAMs, 120 mm tank ammunition and high explosive mortars and tactical vehicles and comes at a time of intense concern that Israel may become involved in a wider Middle East war.  \n             However, the weapons are not expected to get to Israel anytime soon, they are contracts that will take years to fulfill. Much of what is being sold is to help Israel increase its military capability in the long term, the earliest systems being delivered under the contract aren’t expected until the 2026 timeframe. “The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to U.S. national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability. This proposed sale is consistent with those objectives,” the State Department said in a release on the sale. The Biden administration has had to balance its continued support for Israel with a growing number of calls from lawmakers and the U.S. public to curb military support there due to the high number of civilian deaths in Gaza. It has curbed one delivery of 2,000-pound weapons amid continued airstrikes by Israel in densely populated civilian areas in Gaza. \n             \n           The contracts will cover not only the sale of new 50 aircraft to be produced by Boeing. It will also include upgrade kits for Israel to modify its existing fleet of two dozen F-15 fighter jets with new engines and radars, among other upgrades. The jets comprise the biggest portion of the $20 billion in sales with the first deliveries expected in 2029.",

During his visit, Blinken will stress the critical importance of all parties in the region avoiding further escalation.  \n             Principal Deputy Spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, Vedant Patel, in a press statement on Friday, “Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken will travel to Israel on August 17 to continue intensive diplomatic efforts to finalise the agreement for a ceasefire and the release of hostages and detainees, through the bridging proposal presented today by the United States, with support from Egypt and Qatar.” The proposal, backed by Egypt and Qatar, also seeks to guarantee the delivery of humanitarian aid across Gaza. “This proposal would achieve a ceasefire in Gaza, secure the release of all hostages, ensure humanitarian assistance is distributed throughout Gaza, and create conditions for broader regional stability,” reads the statement. “Secretary Blinken will underscore the critical need for all parties in the region to avoid escalation or any actions that could undermine the ability to finalise an agreement,” it further said.

We endorsed the joint call from President Biden, President Sisi of Egypt, and Amir Tamim of Qatar to renew talks later this week with the aim of concluding the deal as soon as possible, stressing that there is no further time to lose,” the joint statement read. “All parties must live up to their responsibilities. Additionally, the unfettered delivery and distribution of aid is needed. We expressed our support for the defence of Israel against Iranian aggression and against attacks by Iran-backed terrorist groups,” it added. The conflict in Gaza escalated following the October 7 attack by Hamas, during which approximately 2,500 militants breached the border into Israel from the Gaza Strip, resulting in casualties and hostage-taking. Israel has described its military actions in Gaza as targeting Hamas’ infrastructure, with the aim of dismantling the entire terror group while striving to reduce civilian casualties.

        "text": "TEL AVIV, Israel:  Antony Blinken, the US Secretary of State has landed in the Middle East on what is his ninth diplomatic mission to the region since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Antony Blinken says he hopes for the quick conclusion of a ceasefire agreement hanging in the balance.  \n             Ahead of another significant meeting of ceasefire negotiators in Cairo later this week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel on Sunday. He is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and President Isaac Herzog on Monday. According to the State Department, Blinken will then travel to Egypt on Tuesday to engage with officials there and may visit at least one more country in the region before returning to the United States. A senior official accompanying Blinken stated that his arrival in the region is at a “critical juncture” for the ceasefire discussions. He intends to urge all involved parties to expedite the conclusion of the ceasefire to alleviate civilian suffering in Gaza and avert the spread of the conflict throughout the region. Last week, the trio of mediating countries—Egypt, Qatar, and the USA—announced advancements in a potential ceasefire deal. This agreement would require Israel to cease most military actions in Gaza and free several Palestinian prisoners as a trade for the liberation of hostages held by Hamas. \n             \n           Officials have stated that the USA has put forward proposals to bridge the remaining gaps between Israeli and Hamas positions. Formal responses to the U.S. proposals are anticipated this week, which may result in a ceasefire declaration unless the negotiations fail, as has occurred with several prior attempts to conclude the 10-month-old conflict. Meanwhile, Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of obstructing ceasefire negotiations on Sunday. U.S. President Joe Biden appeared optimistic about reaching an agreement, stating on Friday that “we are closer than we’ve ever been.” Israel has reacted favorably to the bridging proposals, but Hamas has not yet disclosed its response. The Palestinian death toll in Gaza has climbed past 40,000 since the war began, according to the Palestinian health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilian and militant deaths.

The statement marked the first time Netanyahu publicly endorsed the latest US formula.  \n             Blinken termed his meeting with Netanyahu a “very constructive” one and said that the Israeli Prime Minister has confirmed to him that Israel accepts the bridging proposal. “It’s now incumbent on Hamas to do the same. And then the parties, with the help of the mediators – the United States, Egypt, and Qatar – have to come together and complete the process of reaching clear understandings about how they’ll implement the commitments that they’ve made under this agreement,” he said. “But the next important step is for Hamas to say yes and then, in the coming days, for all of the expert negotiators to get together to work on clear understandings on implementing the agreement,” Blinken added. \n             \n           Earlier on Saturday, Israel had cautiously welcomed the new US proposal.

According to the data, pre-Covid tourism stood at 2,333,796 in 2018 and 1,913,702 in 2019 which slumped in the pandemic years.

Wickremesinghe was sworn in as the eighth President of Sri Lanka in July 2022, when then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa resigned from the post. He announced his candidature for the presidential polls in July. In the run-up to the presidential elections, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) – the largest party in parliament – decided to withdraw their backing for President Ranil Wickremesinghe, preferring instead to put forward a candidate of their own. It’s significant to note that the SLPP is firmly associated with the Rajapaksa brothers, known for holding prominent government roles in the past.",

        "text": "US Presidential Elections: Robert F Kennedy Jr Suspends Campaign; Throws Support To Donald Trump   \n         Washington DC : The upcoming presidential elections in the United States are witnessing new twists and turns every day. In the latest surprise, Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Friday (local time) suspended his campaign and extended his support to former President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, the New York Times reported. Kennedy announced this during a speech in Phoenix, stating that he was withdrawing his name. He criticized the Democratic Party, accusing it of “abandoning democracy” and engaging in “continued legal warfare” against him and Trump. Kennedy’s announcement was pre-empted on Friday by his own legal team, in a filing in a Pennsylvania court case challenging his ballot access in the battleground state.  \n             A lawyer for Kennedy wrote that the campaign was dropping its opposition to the complaint “as a result of today’s endorsement of Donald Trump for the office of President of the United States.” Kennedy, 70, the scion of a Democratic political dynasty, ran a campaign that combined populist economic rhetoric, isolationist foreign policy leanings and government skepticism. He found a base of support among Kennedy-curious independent voters and disaffected Democrats and Republicans, according to the NYT. He began his presidential campaign last year as a Democrat, seeking to challenge President Biden for the nomination. But when he found his path there blocked — which he blamed on the Democratic Party — he embarked on an independent campaign that unnerved both major parties, as allies of both Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump feared he could siphon support from their candidates. \n             \n           As Kennedy began to get on state ballots, his poll numbers, once in the double digits, began to soften — a trend that is often seen among third-party and independent candidates as the general election approaches. By the end of August, polls put him at around 5 per cent nationwide. Additionally, his campaign was running out of money, campaign finance filings showed. Kennedy, an environmental lawyer, has emerged over the past two decades as a prominent opponent of vaccine mandates, promoting widely refuted claims that childhood vaccinations cause autism and railing against what he called the “corporate capture” of the federal government by pharmaceutical companies. During his campaign, Kennedy was known for opposing US aid to Ukraine, supporting Israel’s military operations in Gaza, and pushing for tighter border security. His stance on abortion wasn’t fixed; it evolved over time and eventually leaned towards setting restrictions based on the fetus’s viability. Though he tried to link himself with the political legacy of his family, often referring to his father and uncle, Robert F. Kennedy and John F. Kennedy, his family members didn’t reciprocate. Instead, they chose to endorse President Biden and openly criticized Kennedy’s campaign, as noted by the New York Times.",

        "text": "Ramallah : A wounded Palestinian prisoner has died in an Israeli hospital, two Palestinian organisations said. Zaher Raddad, a 19-year-old from the town of Saida in Tulkarm, northern West Bank, passed away in the Israeli Meir Hospital, according to a statement from the Prisoners and Ex-Prisoners Affairs Authority, a part of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, as well as the Palestinian Prisoners Club.  \n             As per the statement released on Sunday. Raddad was arrested on July 23 after being shot by the Israeli army, who then “used him as a human shield during the military operation by placing him at the front of one of their military vehicles in the city.” According to the statement, Raddad’s death brings the total number of prisoners who have died in Israeli prisons since October 7, 2023, to 23. There has been no Israeli statement on the death of Raddad, Xinhua news agency reported. Recently, the violence between Hamas and Israel has surged, causing numerous deaths and widespread destruction. Rocket attacks, airstrikes, and ground assaults have worsened the situation, plunging the region into a deep humanitarian crisis. In response to the violence, the world has condemned the ongoing conflict and urged an immediate ceasefire to save lives. Diplomatic efforts are in motion, aiming for a peaceful resolution and to tackle the core issues faced by both sides. \n             \n           Since October 2023, Israel has been conducting a large-scale military operation against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. This conflict has resulted in the deaths of over 40,000 Palestinians, following an unprecedented attack by Hamas on Israeli towns near the Strip, which claimed the lives of around 1,200 people. As per the news agency IANS report, the statement further detailed that Raddad had been held at Meir Hospital under critical and unstable health conditions, reliant on artificial respiration after undergoing several surgeries. Despite his grave condition, the Israeli authorities continued his detention until his death on Sunday. The two Palestinian organizations condemned the actions of the Israeli occupation as a compounded crime, beginning with Raddad’s arrest and shooting, continuing through his use as a human shield, and extending to his ongoing detention despite his critical health condition. They characterized this incident as part of the unprecedented scale of crimes committed by the Israeli occupation since the start of its genocidal campaign against the people of Gaza and its continued aggression against Palestinians throughout all occupied territories.

        "description": "After witnessing a hundred Israeli combat aircraft zooming over South Lebanon, destroying a multitude of Hezbollah missile setups in a pro-active strike, the Middle East braces itself for an escalated conflict that could potentially rope in Iran along with its backed military factions.",
        "text": "Tensions Soar In Middle East Following Intense Exchange Of Fire Between Israel And Hezbollah | Representative image   \n         The Middle East prepared for the possibility of a broader conflict that could draw in Iran and its allied militias after 100 fighter jets of Israel bombarded over southern Lebanon, destroying thousands of Hezbollah missile launchers in a ‘preemptive strike’. The strike began at around 5 am local time which was, according to the Israeli officials, based on specific intelligence that Hezbollah was planning to fire hundreds and thousands of missile at northern Israel as well as about to launch drone strikes at a key intelligence centre near Tel Aviv in retaliation for the killing of its commander in July.  \n             Israel has declared a 48-hour emergency state, leading to the temporary shutting down of their main airport. This resulted in numerous international flights being cancelled. As a reaction to this, Hezbollah launched over 200 projectiles, which Israel reported caused minimal harm. An Israeli soldier tragically lost his life, not from the direct attack, but due to debris fallout. Meanwhile, Lebanon reported three losses as a result of this event. Had Hezbollah undertaken a strike on central areas in Israel, the skirmishes that have been cycling around the border for the past ten months could have snowballed into a full-blown conflict. “Our hope is that the events of last night do not spill out into an escalation that leads to regional war,” US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Sunday during a visit to Canada. \n             \n           Israel has recently let its airport get back to business and loosened up restrictions on public gatherings that were imposed earlier. Israel’s military representative, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, confirmed that no damage was inflicted on any Israeli military bases. On Sunday night, the Israeli army opted against reinstating public safety measures, hinting at a lack of concern for any immediate risks of additional attacks. Furthermore, negotiations scheduled on Sunday for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian paramilitary group in Gaza, went on as planned. Hamas’ delegation has recently left Cairo and according to their leader and spokesman, Osama Hamdan, there’s a bit of a hiccup in the peace process. It appears Israel has put forth new ceasefire conditions. Hamdan also had a bone to pick with President Joe Biden’s administration, accusing it of creating a smokescreen of false hopes by hinting at a possible agreement just for political clout. The conversation will continue, albeit at a slower pace, in the following days with the intention of lessening the gap between the various factions. According to a report by the Associated Press citing an anonymous US authority, the talks have been encouraging so far, with participants working towards finding a workable deal. The Consequences Mike Singh, who is at the helm of the Washington Institute, suggested that the Israeli-Hezbollah incident shows more promise in aiding, rather than muddling, the cease-fire talks. The incident allows Israel to expressly communicate its readiness to raise the stakes if pushed, with the US firmly in its corner. The message resonates clearly, signaling a stern warning for Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran if they persist in rejecting a possible deal. Hezbollah, on the other hand, responded with attacks on Israel, asserting it was payback for the death of their leader Fuad Shukr. They went as far as launching a considerable amount of missiles and drones that targeted multiple military bases and installations in Israel’s north. The main target of the dreadful attack was the Mossad intelligence service which is based in Glilot, Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah said Sunday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu chaired a security cabinet meeting on Sunday and said he was “determined to do everything to defend our country, to return the residents of the north securely to their homes, and to continue upholding a simple rule: Whoever harms us – we will harm them.” Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani, who stands as a representative for the Israeli forces, pointed out that there was a phone call exchanged between Yoav Gallant, the Israeli Defense Minister, and Lloyd Austin, the Defense Secretary of the US, over the weekend. He remained reserved about whether the US was given a heads-up before Sunday’s attack, only revealing it was an operation executed by Israel.",

        "description": "According to a senior US official familiar with the Cairo negotiations, the talks to strike a deal for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages had made progress over the weekend.",
        "text": "After a massive exchange of fire between Israel and the Iran-backed group Hezbollah over the weekend, the White House said that the negotiators continue to work to strike a deal for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages.   \n         USA : The White House said on Monday that the negotiators continue to work to strike a deal for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages, CNN reported.  The talks had made progress over the weekend, according to a senior US official familiar with the talks in Cairo, where mediators discussed “final details” of a potential agreement including the names of prisoners that would be exchanged as part of the pact.  \n             While such progress does not guarantee a final agreement anytime soon, negotiators in the Egyptian capital are now discussing the “nuts and bolts” of a deal, the official said. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Monday that all sides, including Hamas, are represented in the talks and that the discussions have been able to move on with more specificity as they work to hammer out a deal.  However, Bassem Naim, a Hamas political bureau member, said Hamas was not participating in negotiations on Monday. Speaking to Al Arabi TV, he reiterated Hamas’s position that it is “ready to negotiate what was agreed upon” in a July 2 proposal but will “not accept the conditions that [Israel Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu added.” \n             \n           Hamas launched a massive terror attack on Israel on October 7 last year, killing 1200 people and holding over 250 hostages, out of which over 100 are still in captivity. In response, Israel launched a strong counteroffensive targeting Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli operation, however, has been criticised for civilian casualties. Over 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli operation, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Netanyahu has insisted that the war in Gaza will continue until a “total victory” against Hamas has been won, even if a deal is reached. That objective has been questioned by many top Israeli officials, including his own defence minister, and family members of captives held by Hamas. Negotiators have worked for months to bridge demands by Netanyahu and Hamas. The remaining sticking points, while significant, are seen as potentially surmountable, CNN reported citing the official. One issue is the Israeli military’s presence on Gaza’s side of the border with Egypt, an area known as the Philadelphi corridor. Hamas opposes Israel’s desire to continue to station troops there in the early phase of a ceasefire deal. The US official said the current proposal calls for an Israeli military withdrawal from “densely populated areas” in Gaza, and that the current debate is focused on what parts of the Philadelphi corridor qualify as densely populated versus unpopulated, where the IDF will maintain a presence in the first phase of an agreement. However, the Hamas negotiating delegation left Cairo on Sunday publicly reiterating the group’s demand that any agreement must include “a permanent ceasefire, a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the freedom of return of residents to their areas, relief and reconstruction, and a serious exchange deal.” The US official said despite public comments by Hamas, “negotiators believe Hamas may be more flexible on an Israeli presence during the first phase of an agreement.”  (With ANI Inputs)",

The incident underscored the importance of this, as the armoured vehicle saved the lives of the staff members and revealed that current coordination mechanisms are ineffective. Dujarric assured that the UN would continue to work with the Israeli  army to ensure that such incidents do not recur.  The international spokesperson stressed the necessity for all parties to respect international humanitarian law at all times, which includes the protection of civilians and the provision of their basic needs, such as food, water, shelter, and health care, wherever they are in Gaza .

Worryingly, three children presenting with suspected acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), a common symptom of polio, have since been reported in the Gaza Strip, news agency ANI reported. Polio, short for poliomyelitis, is a highly contagious viral disease that primarily targets young children. It spreads through contaminated food and water, sometimes leading to paralysis in severe cases. Even with effective vaccines available, polio remains a worry in certain parts of the world. Despite significant advances, many hurdles remain in the battle against polio. Issues like vaccine hesitancy, difficult access to remote areas, and conflicts in certain regions continue to impede vaccination efforts. (With ANI Inputs)",

        "description": "The strike on the UN-run Abu Araban site in central Gaza's Nuseirat camp was the fifth on a school-turned-shelter in eight days.",
        "text": "Israel said the offensive in Rafah is expected to be completed within weeks.   \n         Tel Aviv : On a major development to the Israel-Hamas war, Israeli jets struck several Hamas terrorists using a United Nations school in the central Gaza town of Nuseirat, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed on Sunday. Giving details, the civil defence agency in Hamas-run Gaza said on Sunday that 15 people were killed in a strike on a school sheltering war displaced where the Israeli military said it had targeted “terrorists”.  \n             The strike on the UN-run Abu Araban site in central Gaza’s Nuseirat camp was the fifth on a school-turned-shelter in eight days. According to the army, Hamas used the Abu Oraiban School as a hideout and as a point to direct and launch attacks on Israeli soldiers. Steps were taken to mitigate the risk of collateral damage to civilians, including the use of precise munitions and other intelligence measures. The Abu Oraiban school is operated by the UN Relief and Works Agency. The UNRWA, which supports Palestinian refugees, has been under fire for months, with Israeli officials demanding the agency be stripped of its authority in Gaza and defunded amid revelations that members of the agency’s staff participated in Hamas’s October 7 attacks. The Israeli government is bypassing UNRWA in distributing humanitarian aid. The Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee recently advanced legislation designating UNRWA as a “terror organization,” stripping the agency of its diplomatic immunity, tax-exempt status, and other legal benefits. \n             \n           Israel’s largest bank froze UNRWA’s account in February over suspicious financial transfers that the agency failed to adequately explain. That same month, Israeli forces discovered a Hamas complex located directly under the UNRWA’s Gaza City headquarters and connected directly to the agency’s electricity system. The facility included numerous computer servers belonging to the terror group. More than 100 survivors of Hamas’s October 7 attacks filed a $1 billion lawsuit against UNRWA, accusing the agency of “aiding and abetting” the terror group. The Israel Lands Authority in May ordered UNRWA to vacate its Jerusalem offices over violations of its lease. Palestinian refugees are the only refugee population with its own dedicated UN agency. The rest of the world’s refugees fall under the mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Israeli officials have called for UNRWA to be closed and for Palestinian refugees to be brought under the responsibility of the UNHCR. At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 116 remaining hostages, more than 30 are believed dead. (With Inputs From Agencies)",

He is still experiencing a loose, non-­productive cough and hoarseness, but his symptoms continue to improve steadily,” Dr O’Connor said. His pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate and temperature remain absolutely normal, his oxygen saturation continues to be excellent on room air and his lungs remain clear, Dr O’Connor said. “The president continues to tolerate treatment well and will continue PAXLOVID (anti-Covid pill) as planned. He continues to perform all of his presidential duties,” the doctor said. \n             \n           Biden tested positive for COVID-19 on July 17 which led to halting his campaign at a critical juncture in the presidential election when he was facing increasing pressure about his health and concerns about his viability as a candidate. He returned to his home in Delaware and isolated himself. It’s unclear where and when the president contracted COVID-19. But the sudden diagnosis has placed him behind closed doors at a time when Democratic lawmakers have been clamouring to see him out front.",

        "text": "Kamala Harris' Husband Doug Emhoff Admits Having Extramarital Affair During First Marriage: Report   \n         Washington : US Vice President Kamala Harris is all set to become the Democratic presidential nominee for the US presidential Election 2024. If she wins the US Presidential Elections, Kamala Harris is expected to stick to Joe Biden’s foreign policy playbook on key issues such as Ukraine, China and Iran but could strike a tougher tone with Israel over the Gaza war.  \n             As the most clear frontrunner for the nomination after Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her on Sunday, Harris would bring on-the-job experience, personal ties forged with world leaders, and a sense of global affairs gained during a Senate term and as Biden’s second-in-command. On a range of global priorities, analysts told Reuters that a Harris presidency would resemble a second Biden administration. “She may be a more energetic player but one thing you shouldn’t expect – any immediate big shifts in the substance of Biden’s foreign policy,” Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator for Democratic and Republican administrations, was quoted as saying by Reuters. \n             \n           If she becomes the nominee, Democrats will be hoping Harris will be more effective at communicating her foreign policy goals. In the second half of Biden’s presidency, Harris elevated her profile on issues ranging from China and Russia to Gaza and become a known quantity to many world leaders. Saying that she is “honoured” to have President Joe Biden’s endorsement, US Vice President Kamala Harris said that she “intends to earn and win” the Democratic Party’s nomination for the November presidential polls. Earlier in the day, after announcing his decision to not seek re-election, Biden endorsed Harris as the presidential nominee for the Democratic Party and called on Democrats to “come together and beat” Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. In a statement, Kamala Harris stated, “I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination. Over the past year, I have travelled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead. I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party-and unite our nation–to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda.” “We have 107 days until Election Day. Together, we will fight. And together, we will win,” she added. She expressed gratitude to Biden for his “extraordinary leadership” as US President and his decades of service to the country. “On behalf of the American people, I thank Joe Biden for his extraordinary leadership as President of the United States and for his decades of service to our country. His remarkable legacy of accomplishment is unmatched in modern American history, surpassing the legacy of many Presidents who have served two terms in office,” Kamala Harris stated.

        "text": "Benjamin Netanyahu   \n         Washington : Massive protests erupted in the US as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began speaking to a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday. During his address, more than 5,000 protesters massed on the streets near Capitol Hill, waving Palestinian flags and chanting for United States to stop arming Israel.  \n             During his address, the Israeli Prime Minister also urged the American leaders to provide bipartisan support to the war-ridden country, amid its ongoing conflict with Hamas in Gaza. Some groups of demonstrators attempted to barricade Netanyahu’s potential routes to the Capitol, with one group handing out an effigy of the prime minister in handcuffs and the other group even burning the American flag. During his address to Congress, Netanyahu called out Iran for funding and promoting anti-Israel protests in America. Netanyahu went on to call protesters “Iran useful idiots.” \n             \n           “Our enemies are your enemies. Our fight is your fight, and our victory will be your victory,” Netanyahu strongly emphasised the strategic role of Israel in countering Iran. Netanyahu did not mention a ceasefire by name or discuss the status of the deal that Israel and Hamas have been negotiating for weeks, something the Biden administration desperately wants to get done. However, Benjamin Netanyahu said the war could end if Hamas surrendered its arms and returned hostages. During his remarks, the Israeli prime minister called the Hamas terror attack on October “a day that will forever live in infamy, comparing it to the attacks on Pearl Harbour and 911.” The Israeli PM praised US President Joe Biden for his efforts to free hostages held by Hamas. “I think Biden and I have known each other for 40 years,” Netanyahu said, adding, “I want to thank him for half a century of friendship with Israel.” Moreover, Biden and Netanyahu are scheduled to meet at the White House on Thursday. Netanyahu did not shy away from praising former US president and Republican candidate Donald Trump for his support of Israel. Netanyahu also said he was happy that the former president emerged safe and sound from the shooting in Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, more than 30 members of Congress did not attend Netanyahu’s address, in protest of the Israeli Prime Minister’s approach to the Israel-Hamas war. Elon Musk attended the Netanyahu address in Washington as one of the Israeli Prime Minister’s special guests.",

Vice President Harris touted her “unwavering” support for Israel during her discussions with Netanyahu.  \n             According to CNN, her remarks provided one of the clearest explanations yet of her views on the conflict, as she warned the Israeli government that it matters how the war is conducted. “There has been hopeful movement in the talks to secure an agreement on this deal.

So to everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire and to everyone who yearns for peace, I see you and I hear you,” Harris told reporters in remarks after the meeting, as reported by CNN.

        "text": "US Senator Marco Rubio on Thursday introduced a bill in the Congress which proposes to treat India on par same way like its other allies as Japan, Israel, Korea and NATO allies regarding technology transfers, support India in its response to growing threats to its territorial integrity and bar Pakistan from receiving security assistance if it is found to have sponsored terrorism against India.  \n             “Communist China continues to aggressively expand its domain in the Indo-Pacific region, all while it seeks to impede the sovereignty and autonomy of our regional partners. It’s crucial for the U.S. to continue its support in countering these malicious tactics. India, along with other nations in the region, is not alone,” Rubio said after he introduced the U.S.-India Defense Cooperation Act in the Senate. As the Congress is divided being this is an election year, the bill is unlikely to make much headway, but might be reintroduced in the next Congress given that there is a bipartisan level of support on India-US relationship. The bill notes that the US-India partnership is vital to countering influences from Communist China. In order to strengthen this partnership, it is essential to enhance our strategic diplomatic, economic, and military relationship with New Delhi, it asserts. What Is US Senator Bill On India The bill would set a Statement of Policy that the US will support India in its response to growing threats to its territorial integrity, provide necessary security assistance to India to deter adversaries, and cooperate with India with respect to defense, civil space, technology, medicine and economic investments. \n             \n           When passed into law, it would provide a limited exemption for India from CAATSA sanctions for purchases of Russian equipment that are currently used by the Indian military and set a sense of Congress that expeditious consideration of certifications of letters of offer to sell defense articles, defense services, design and construction services, and major defense equipment to India is consistent with US interests and it is in the interest of peace and stability India to have the capabilities needed to deter threats. It proposes to treat India as if it were of the same status as the US allies such as Japan, Israel, Korea, and NATO allies regarding technology transfers; authorize the Secretary of State to enter into a memorandum of understanding with India to increase military cooperation; expedite excess defense articles to India for two years and grant India the same status as other allies; and expand International Military Education and Training Cooperation with New Delhi. It requires a report to Congress on Pakistan’s use of offensive force, including through terrorism and proxy groups, against India; and bar Pakistan from receiving security assistance if it is found to have sponsored terrorism against India. This is for the first time such an India-centric bill has been introduced in the US Congress that proposes to put India at the same level of that of its treaty ally, exempt it from CAATSA sanctions, and imposes sanctions on Pakistan for promoting terrorism in India.

        "text": "Ancient site in Palestine gets UNESCO tag amid conflict in Gaza, also put on heritage in danger list\n (Image: UNESCO/X)   \n         Amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza, the ancient heritage site of Saint Hilarion Monastery/Tell Umm Amer in Palestine was granted the UNESCO tag. Simultaneously, it was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger through an ’emergency nomination’ during the 46th session of the World Heritage Committee (WHC) in Delhi, hosted by India for the first time. The announcement was made during the plenary meeting of the session, highlighting the site’s inscription on both the World Heritage List and List of World Heritage in Danger. This comes amidst Israel’s military offensive in Gaza following attacks by Hamas militants.  \n             India had earlier called for de-escalation and peace negotiations. The recent UNESCO recognition has raised hopes for safeguarding such heritage sites. In a statement, UNESCO emphasized the importance of protecting the site from danger, acknowledging its historical value and significance. The UNESCO  said that “this decision recognises both the site’s value and the need to protect it from danger”. “In view of the threats to this heritage site posed by the ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip, the World Heritage Committee used the emergency inscription procedure provided for in the World Heritage Convention,” it said. In accordance with the terms of the Convention, “its 195 States Parties are committed to avoid taking any deliberate measures likely to cause direct or indirect damage to this site, which is now inscribed on the World Heritage List, and to assist in its protection”, the world body said. \n             \n           The UNESCO said inclusion on the List of World Heritage in Danger automatically opens the door to “enhanced international technical and financial assistance mechanisms to guarantee the protection of the property and, if necessary, to help facilitate its rehabilitation”. The Monastery of Saint Hilarion/Tell Umm Amer stands as one of the oldest sites in the Middle East, founded by Saint Hilarion and serving as the initial home to the first monastic community in the Holy Land. Positioned at a pivotal juncture where the main trade routes between Asia and Africa intersected, it thrived as a hub for religious, cultural, and economic interactions during the Byzantine era. In a significant development, during its 18th session in December 2023, UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Committee for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict decided to grant ‘provisional enhanced protection’ to the monastery under the 1954 Hague Convention and its Second Protocol. The Palestinian delegation, led by Mounir Anastas, expressed gratitude to UNESCO for this dual inscription, aiming to provide a protective shield and draw global attention to this heritage site amidst conflict-ridden areas. “I am honoured to have this inscription taking place in the greatest democracy in the world. Thank you, India. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all Committee members for their valuable support for this inscription,” Anastas said in his statement made in the session right after the inscription. He also thanked ICOMOS, an advisory body of the UNESCO, and the Secretariat of the UNESCO. “This decision by the World Heritage Committee and the UNESCO is a clear message of hope to our population in Gaza. This is the most important point of this inscription,” Anastas told PTI on the sidelines of the event. (With PTI inputs)",

Issuing a joint statement, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau and New Zealand’s PM Christopher Luxon called for an immediate ceasefire is needed desperately.  \n             “The situation in Gaza is catastrophic. The human suffering is unacceptable. It cannot continue. We remain unequivocal in our condemnation of Hamas for the atrocities of October 7 and ongoing acts of terror.

Expressing concerns about the prospect of further escalation across the region, the leaders said, “We condemn Iran’s attack against Israel of April 13-14, call on Iran to refrain from further destabilizing actions in the Middle East, and demand that Iran and its affiliated groups, including Hizballah, cease their attacks. We also condemn the Houthis’ ongoing reckless acts, including their indiscriminate drone attack in Tel Aviv and ongoing attacks on international shipping.” \n \n \n \n \n \n “This escalation in hostilities only makes a ceasefire in Gaza more urgent. We urge all involved actors to exercise restraint and de-escalate. We support diplomatic efforts to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701. A wider scale war would have disastrous consequences for Israel and Lebanon, and for civilians across the region,” the statement added.",

Herzi Halevi, the Northern Command’s Commanding Officer, the Operations Directorate Head, the Israel Air Force Head, and other members of the General Staff Forum are still conducting a situational assessment of the incident. Additionally, the Northern Command’s Commanding Office, Major-General Ori Gordin, conducted a situational assessment in Majdal Shams, where he also visited the incident area. Following the attack, alarms were activated in the Majdal Shams area in the Northern Galilee at 6:18 pm. The Israel Police reported that they are dealing with a number of scenes where shrapnel fell in the north of the Golan directly after initial reports of the incident, The Jerusalem Post reported.",

        "description": "Over 170,000 volunteers have also signed up to help the Harris campaign with phone banking, canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts.",
        "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris waves upon arrival at Andrews Air Force Base in Md., Saturday, July 27, 2024. Harris is returning to Washington after participating in a political event in Pittsfield, Mass. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough, Pool)   \n         Washington:  Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has raised $200 million since she emerged as the likely Democratic presidential nominee last week, an eyepopping haul in her race against the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump.  \n             The campaign, which announced its latest fundraising total on Sunday, said the bulk of the donations — 66% — comes from first-time contributors in the 2024 election cycle and were made after President Joe Biden announced his exit from the race and endorsed Harris. Over 170,000 volunteers have also signed up to help the Harris campaign with phone banking, canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts. Election Day is 100 days away. “The momentum and energy for Vice President Harris is real — and so are the fundamentals of this race: this election will be very close and decided by a small number of voters in just a few states,” Michael Tyler, the campaign’s communications director, wrote in a memo. \n             \n           Her campaign said it held some 2,300 organizing events in battleground states this weekend as several high-profile Democrats under consideration to serve as Harris’ running mate stumped for her. Harris campaigned in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on Saturday, drawing hundreds to a fundraiser that had been organized when Biden was still at the top of the Democratic ticket. The fundraiser had originally been expected to raise $400,000 but ended bringing in about $1.4 million, according to the campaign. Mandy Robbins, 45, of Decatur, Georgia, drove to one of those organizing events Sunday in the northern suburbs of Atlanta to hear Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a potential Harris running mate. She thought Biden did a “great job” in the White House, but acknowledged she “would not have been nearly this excited” if he remained in the race. “I finally feel hopeful now,” Robbins said. She added, “We can win this with Harris” Beshear spoke from experience to supporters, telling them their work could be the difference in what’s expected to be a close race. Beshear won his 2019 campaign by a margin of about 5,000 votes of 1.41 million ballots cast. He was reelected in November by a relatively comfortable margin. “Every door knock mattered. Every phone call mattered. Every difficult conversation that people had with their uncle at Thanksgiving mattered,” Beshear said of his 2019 race. “Everyone here today that signs up to volunteer … you might be the difference in winning this race for Vice President Harris.” Meanwhile, Trump, running mate Sen. JD Vance and their surrogates stepped up efforts to frame Harris as a far-left politician out of touch with with the American mainstream. Vance said after a stop at a diner in Waite Park, Minnesota, on Sunday that Harris has “got a little bit of a bump from her introduction” but predicted it would soon dissipate. “Look, the people are going to learn her record,” Vance said. “They’re going to learn that she’s a radical. They’re going to learn that she’s basically a San Francisco liberal who wants to take San Francisco policies to the entire country.” Vance was echoing Trump, who in a campaign appearance with Vance in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday, called Harris a “crazy liberal,” accused her of wanting to “defund the police” and said she was an “absolute radical” on abortion. Harris, a vocal proponent of abortion rights, has made clear that she will make Republican-backed efforts to restrict reproductive rights a key plank in her campaign. “There is no liberal horse that she has chosen not to ride,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. “ Trump backer Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., also tried to brand Harris as a full partner for “a lot of the worst decisions of the Biden administration,” including the chaotic August 2021 pullout of U.S. troops led to the swift collapse of the Afghan government and military. Cotton also accused Harris of emboldening Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah by pressing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over civilian casualties in the war in Gaza. Netanyahu met separately with Harris and Biden at the White House on Thursday. Afterward, Harris said she urged Netanyahu to reach a cease-fire deal soon with the militant group Hamas so that dozens of hostages held by the militants in Gaza since Oct. 7 can return home. Harris said she also affirmed Israel’s right to defend itself but expressed deep concern about the high death toll in Gaza and the “dire” humanitarian situation there. Tensions in the Mideast intensified on Saturday after Israeli authorities said a rocket from Lebanon struck a soccer field in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, killing 12 children and teenagers. The strike raised fears of a broader regional war between Israel and Hezbollah, which denied a role in the attack. Trump at his Saturday rally said the Golan Heights incident “will go down as another moment in history created by a weak and ineffective United States president and vice president.” And Vance on Sunday accused Harris of being “a disaster” on the conflict. Still, some Republicans are concerned that Harris’ entrance has given Democrats a spark and that Trump needs to recalibrate. Gov. Chris Sununu, R-N.H., said Harris is in “honeymoon” period that will probably last a month, but he also said that both Trump and Vance should stop the personal attacks against Harris because those will not drive people to vote. Instead, he said they must stick to the issues and “stay away from the insults.” He said Trump missed an opportunity to do that in recent campaign events, but “hopefully they can get back on track.” Sununu, however, acknowledged that ”nobody can get Donald Trump to do anything” he doesn’t want to do. “But hopefully the numbers, the polls, will get Donald Trump to realize what was working and what didn’t,” Sununu said Graham was on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Sununu was on ABC’s “This Week, and Cotton was on CNN’s “State of the Union.”",

        "text": "'Do Not Reflect True...': Hamas Says Biden's Comments On Gaza Peace Talks 'Misleading'   \n         Tel Aviv : Amid intensified war with Hamas in Gaza, Israel said that Hezbollah will “pay the price” after a rocket attack at Golan Heights killed 12 children, for which Tel Aviv blamed the Lebanese group, CNN reported on Sunday. The latest development further sparked fears that an all-out war would envelop the region.  \n             Hezbollah has “firmly” denied the allegations that it was behind the strike, the deadliest to hit Israel or Israeli-controlled territory since the October 7 attacks. Israeli warplanes conducted airstrikes against Hezbollah targets “deep inside Lebanese territory” and along the border overnight Sunday, the Israeli military said in a statement from the military on Sunday morning. But, it was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties from those strikes. Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant pledged a heavy response, during a visit to the town of Majdal Shams near the Syrian and Lebanese borders, where the rocket attack left children and teenagers dead on Saturday. \n             \n           “Hezbollah is responsible for this and they will pay the price,” Gallant said. In an earlier statement from his office, he added: “We will hit the enemy hard.” The Saturday attacks on the region involved “approximately 30 projectiles” crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Israel’s military quickly blamed the Iran-backed group for the attack. According to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, the attack killed 12 children and left 44 people injured. The children killed in the strike had been playing on a soccer field, CNN reported. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday backed Israel’s assessment, saying “every indication” suggested the strike was a rocket fired by Hezbollah. Some 20,000 Druze Arabs live in the Golan Heights, an area Israel seized from Syria in 1967 during the Six-Day War and annexed in 1981. Considered occupied territory under international law and UN Security Council resolutions, the area is also home to about 25,000 Israeli Jewish settlers, according to CNN. Israel and Hezbollah have been trading rocket fire on an almost daily basis since the deadly October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, and those exchanges have become increasingly volatile, sparking fears on several occasions that Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza would spiral into a conflict on multiple fronts across the Middle East. While Hezbollah admitted striking the Golan Heights on Saturday, it rejected responsibility for the attack on Majdal Shams. (With Inputs From ANI)",

        "text": "Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib has called for an investigation into the July 27 attack on the Druze town of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, which claimed the lives of 12 people.  The Golan Heights, partially captured by Israel from Syria, holds significant geopolitical importance.  \n             Following the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, during which Israel gained control of approximately two-thirds of the plateau, Israel annexed the area in 1981. This move has not been recognized by the international community, with the exception of the United States since 2019. Rich in water resources, the Golan Heights overlooks northern Israel’s Galilee region and the Sea of Galilee, while also dominating the route to Damascus on the Syrian-controlled side. As per an AFP report, the Golan, the region’s biblical Hebrew name, or Jawlan in Arabic, has been coveted by empires and foreign rulers for millennia. Throughout history, the region has been occupied by various powers throughout history, including Herod, the Franks, and the Ottomans. It was eventually incorporated into Syria, which gained independence from France in 1946. On June 9, 1967, Israel secured control of the bulk of the territory following fierce battles with the Syrian army, who launched their attacks from lower positions. \n             \n           During the 1973 intense war, Israel seized an additional pocket of approximately 510 square kilometers (nearly 200 square miles). However, under an armistice agreement the following year, this territory was returned to Syria along with a small portion of the area occupied in 1967. The 1974 agreement established a demilitarized buffer zone, and since then, a UN observer force has been monitoring the ceasefire line on the Golan Heights. \n \n \n \n On December 14, 1981, Israel annexed approximately 1,200 square kilometers of the Golan Heights, which also borders Lebanon and Jordan. “Tens of thousands of Syrian as well as Palestinian residents fled or were expelled from the Golan Heights when Israel seized it, though some remained in the Israeli-controlled part,” AFP reported.  \n Israel and Syria have been at odds for decades, maintaining a formal state of war. Over the years, a ceasefire line has kept a strained peace between them. Efforts from the international community to mediate peace between Israel and Syria have been ongoing. However, longstanding disputes and geopolitical tensions have stalled meaningful progress. The war has deeply affected those in the region, leading to displacement, restricted access to basic needs, and economic difficulties.",

        "description": "The Israel Defense Forces said that top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr was killed in an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon on Tuesday, in retaliation for the rocket attack on the Golan Heights that killed 12 children.",
        "text": "Israel Forces Kills Top Hezbollah Commander Fuad Shukr In Beirut In Response To Majdal Shams Attack   \n         Beirut:   Amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas militants, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that they killed top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in a strike in southern Lebanon on Tuesday (local time). The attack was in retaliation for a rocket attack on the Golan Heights, which claimed the lives of 12 children, according to the Times of Israel. Shukr sat on the Jihad Council, Hezbollah’s top military body, and was considered the head of its strategic division. Since the October 7 attack by Hamas, he has been managing Hezbollah’s attacks against Israel, including the deadly strike in Majdal Shams over the weekend that killed 12 children, according to the military.  \n             The IDF says Shukr was “responsible for the majority of Hezbollah’s most advanced weaponry, including precise-guided missiles, cruise missiles, anti-ship missiles, long-range rockets, and UAVs” and for the terror group’s “force build-up, planning, and execution of terror attacks against the State of Israel,” as reported by Times of Israel. “Eliminated: Fuad Shukr “Sayyid Muhsan”, Hezbollah’s Most Senior Military Commander and Hassan Nasrallah’s Right-Hand Man,” the IDF said in a post on X. \n“Shukr has directed Hezbollah’s attacks on the State of Israel since October 8th, and he was the commander responsible for the murder of the 12 children in Majdal Shams in northern Israel on Saturday evening, as well as the killing of numerous Israelis and foreign nationals over the years. He was also responsible for the majority of Hezbollah’s most advanced weaponry, including precise-guided missiles, cruise missiles, anti-ship missiles, long-range rockets and UAVs,” it added. \nUS Vice President Kamala Harris reacted to the development and expressing support to Israel, said that Tel Aviv has the “right to defend itself.” \nShe also affirmed the need to find a “diplomatic solution” to end these attacks. “Israel has a right to defend itself against a terrorist organization, which is exactly what Hezbollah is. But all of that being said, we still must work on a diplomatic solution to end these attacks and we will continue to do that work,” she told reporters, as quoted by Politico. \nMeanwhile, the Iran-backed Houthis and Hamas have both condemned the Israeli strike, in separate statements, CNN reported. \n             \n           “While we affirm our solidarity with Lebanon and its resistance in the face of Zionist arrogance, we appreciate the great role of Hezbollah in supporting the Palestinian people and triumphing over their oppression, at a time when the Arab regimes have abandoned their role and responsibility in defending the Palestinian people and confronting crimes,” a statement read from the Houthi political wing, also known as Ansar Allah. In a different statement, Hamas declared “full solidarity with our brotherly Lebanon and the brothers in Hezbollah.” Hamas also said it considers the Israeli strike a “dangerous escalation.” \nIsrael had blamed Hezbollah for the rocket attack at Golan Heights on Sunday. The Iranian-backed militant group, however, has denied responsibility. \nThe IDF confirmed the strike in Beirut and said it targeted the commander responsible for the Majdal Shams attack. “Initial report, the IDF carried out a targeted strike in Beirut, on the commander responsible for the murder of the children in Majdal Shams and the killing of numerous additional Israeli civilians,” the IDF said in a post on X. “At the moment, there are no changes in the Home Front Command defensive guidelines. If any changes will be made, an update will be released. Details to follow,” it added. Earlier, CNN reported with references from Lebanese media about a tragic event where a woman lost her life due to an Israeli attack. Several others were injured and immediately rushed to three local hospitals for immediate attention. This unfortunate incident is marked as the most significant escalation of Israeli hostility since the rising tension between Israel and the Iranian-backed militant group that started causing the unease post the incidents of October 7th.",

        "text": "Who Was Hezbollah Commander Fuad Shukr, Killed By Israel In An Air Strike In Beirut?   \n         Beirut:  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed that it killed top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in an airstrike in Beirut on Tuesday (local time). The attack came in retaliation for a rocket strike in the Golan Heights, in which as many as 12 children lost their lives, according to the Times of Israel. Shukr was one of the group’s leading military figures, and Hezbollah was established by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards over four decades ago. The top commander, belonging to the Lebanese Shi’ites, is said to have played a key role in the founding of Hezbollah as a resistance movement against the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. He reportedly shared a close bond with Imad Mughniyeh, who was assassinated in Damascus in 2008, according to Hezbollah sources.  \n             Fuad Shukr And 1983 Bombing On Us Marine Barracks In Beirut According to the White House, Fuad Shukr played a crucial role in the 1983 bombing of its Marine barracks in Beirut, which claimed the lives of 241 soldiers. It then put a bounty of $5 million on Shukr’s head, as per U.S. government’s Rewards for Justice website. \nHe was killed in the targeted attack by the Israel Defence Forces in Beirut against the Hezbollah commander. He was responsible for the recent attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that claimed 12 lives of children. However, denied any role in the attack. \nAs per Hezbollah sources, Shukr, also known as Al-Hajj Mohsin, was adviser to Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. He was also the member of the Shura Council, a decision-making body. How Shukr Became Famous In Hezbollah His rise to prominence within Hezbollah is said to have followed the assassination of Mughniyeh, an enigmatic figure noted for his military strategy and marked as one of the top terrorists on the U.S. wanted list. He was accused of directly planning attacks against Western targets, including the notable Marine barracks. Speaking on the series of attacks and hostage scenarios that rattled Lebanon back in the 1980s, Hezbollah’s head honcho, Nasrallah, clarified in a candid 2022 interaction with an Arabic news platform, stating that these acts were carried out by independent groups having no direct ties with Hezbollah. According to insiders within Hezbollah, Shukr fought with Israeli forces amid the 1982 Israeli invasion. In this epic battle, he fighting side by side with experienced Hezbollah commandants Mughniyeh and Mustafa Badreddine. Unfortunately, Badreddine marked his end in Syria back in 2016. \n             \n           In 2017, the American ‘Rewards for Justice’ program publicized a hefty prize for clues that would aid in the apprehension of a top-ranking Hezbollah military leader stationed in South Lebanon. Identified as a key player in Hezbollah’s premier military group, the Jihad Council, he was recognized for his role in the militia’s operations in Syria, particularly during the Civil War’s early phases where Hezbollah backed President Bashar al-Assad. However, Hezbollah refuted the charges against him and another cohort, Talal Hamiyah. The organization dismissed these allegations and the corresponding bounties as unfounded.",
