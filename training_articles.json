        "description": "A usually joyous month is unrecognizable in the enclave, where over 25 people have died of starvation, as families are observing the fast without access to enough food and clean water.",
        "text": "On the eve of  Ramadan , Hussein Owda and seven members of his family sat down for suhour — the meal Muslims eat before fasting from sunrise to sunset. On the table in front of them were just 7 ounces of labneh, or yogurt cheese, and some bread. “We didn’t finish it, because we are used to eating small amounts of food,” Owda, 37, told NBC News   in a telephone interview. The computer engineer, who was displaced to Rafah in southern  Gaza , said he has lost about 65 pounds since the war between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 7.  Owda, like others NBC News spoke to, said he and his family had been forced to fast for about six months. Now that Ramadan has started, the only difference is that the fast is scheduled. The  ninth and most sacred month of the Islamic calendar , Ramadan is when Muslims believe the first verses of the Quran were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. Around the world, millions who are able will fast during daylight hours to try to strengthen their connection to God and practice discipline and compassion for the less fortunate. Self-reflection, gratitude and   celebration among community are at its core. In Gaza, the usually joyous season marked by gatherings over traditional food and congregational prayers is unrecognizable. Homes once decorated with lights have been reduced to rubble, and tables once surrounded by families and laden with food are bare. Amid  a worsening humanitarian crisis  in the enclave, where more than 31,000 people have been killed and over 25  have died of starvation , according to Gaza officials, many Muslims are seeking refuge in God and observing the fast as a testament to their unwavering faith during profound hardship.

Ali Jadallah / Anadolu via Getty Images Looming famine and broken traditions On the first day of Ramadan, Salem Sbeta, 48, and his family traditionally eat chicken and molokhia, a stew made of jute leaves. Shopping and preparations for Ramadan would start a month earlier and include decorating the home and buying ingredients for traditional sweets, like qatayef — sweet stuffed pancakes — to eat after sunset. “Normally we’d all be gathered, the whole family would be with me,” said Sbeta,   who   was displaced from Al Shuja’iyya, a neighborhood of Gaza City, to Rafah. “We’d be in the house, feeling safe. We had electricity, cold water, a fridge, juices. We made coffee.” At the Sbetas’ makeshift home, handmade Ramadan decorations hang from the ceiling, including a paper fanous, a traditional lantern. NBC News This year, handmade Ramadan decorations festoon the makeshift tent shared by nine family members. “Today, of course, as you can see, there’s no gas. We cook on a fire we make ourselves that burns our hands,” he said. Infinitely worse than their surroundings are the missing family members: One son was killed in the violence and another one was wounded. “I used to knock on their doors and say, ‘Get up, it’s time for suhour!’” Sbeta’s wife, Sabah, said tearfully, referring to the meal eaten before sunrise. “I can’t do that anymore.” The family that remains is trying to celebrate. This year, Salem Sbeta was able to provide molokhia for his family for iftar, or breakfast, on the first day of Ramadan.   It cost him the equivalent of $8 for just over 2 pounds; before the war, the same amount would have cost a little over $1 for the same quantity. Sbeta, a chef by trade, has not been able to work since the war started. The situation is even worse in northern Gaza, where many have no choice but to forage for and cook khobiza, a wild plant. Samiya Abed Jamal, who was displaced to the Jabalia refugee camp, said even this isn’t always an option. “We did not eat   suhour, we just drank water and went to bed,” she said. “We do not have bread or flour.” “What can we do?” Jamal asked. Muslims are encouraged to eat especially nutritious food during Ramadan, including fresh fruit and vegetables, beans, eggs, dairy and animal protein. But this year, a rich and diverse diet is impossible for a vast majority of those living in Gaza. More than half a million Gaza residents face starvation , according to the United Nations. Meanwhile, less and less food and emergency assistance is getting into the enclave, with the amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza falling by 50% from January to February, according to UNRWA, the United Nations agency serving Palestinian refugees. Israeli forces have been  accused of opening fire on people waiting for food ,  striking aid distribution sites  and  turning away aid trucks .  The World Food Programme has said  famine is imminent  in northern Gaza. Over 30% of children under the age of 2 currently suffer from acute malnutrition in the area, up from around 16% in January, UNICEF warned on Friday. Ramadan at a soup kitchen Mahmoud Almadhoun ran a cellphone store in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza before the war.   Now the shop lies in ruins, and instead of selling phones, Almadhoun, 32, feeds the hungry at   the Gaza Soup Kitchen, which is funded by a GoFundMe started by his brother who lives in Washington, D.C. In Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, Mahmoud Almadhoun established the Gaza Soup Kitchen, which has been feeding families every day since it began operations in February. Eshak Daour / Gaza Soup Kitchen On the first day of Ramadan, people gathered around the soup kitchen with hopes of securing food for their families. Almadhoun serves around 500 people per day, and crowds begin showing up at the soup kitchen at 11 a.m. to wait for food to be distributed in the evening, he said. “People are in dire need of food in the north. There’s nothing here but khobiza,” Almadhoun said. With such severe shortages, many in the north of the strip eat just one meal a day, said Juliette Touma, UNRWA’s director of communications. “It is very difficult to find the basics, to cook,” she said. “There is no fresh produce, like vegetables and fruit — dairy products are not really available. So, it’s a very hard and a very, very sad Ramadan for the people of Gaza.” Products that are available are very expensive and out of reach for many Palestinians, Touma said. The price of eggs has increased tenfold since the war began, and besides, they often aren’t fresh, which has sickened a number of people, she added. But even if they’re lucky enough to have quality   food this Ramadan, most Gaza residents will not be celebrating at home because the war has displaced an estimated 80% of the population and  destroyed 45% of its buildings .

AFP - Getty Images file The war was triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 multipronged attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and resulted in the abduction of some 240 — around 130 are believed to remain in Gaza. The potential for a cease-fire seems distant as Israeli airstrikes continue in the enclave, with an  expanding military operation into Rafah  appearing  imminent . Moving around the enclave is difficult and dangerous, and visiting family and friends, a hallmark of Ramadan celebrations, is now impossible for many, like Owda. “There’s nothing left,” Owda said. “My home is gone, it was destroyed. My parent’s home is also gone, my sister’s home is gone, my brother’s home is gone, my uncle’s home is gone, my grandfather’s home is gone — there aren’t even any homes left to  visit.” Owda can’t spend time with his uncle and uncle’s family like he did last year because they were all killed in an airstrike. “We don’t even know where they were buried, so I can’t even visit their graves,” he said. A reliance on God Anyone who can’t take part in the fast in a healthy and safe way is exempt from it —  including those who are sick  or malnourished. However, many Muslim Gazans who say they’ve been hungry for months anyway are observing the fast without access to the quality food and clean water they need out of devotion to God. Sabah Sbeta, 45, is grateful for what she has this Ramadan and plans to fast, leaning heavily on the Islamic concept of   tawakkul, a trust in and reliance on God. “Thank God, lord of all the worlds, for everything. Oh, God, there is no objection to your ruling,” she said, uttering a prayer that many Muslims say when going through difficult times. Sbeta is not the only Muslim in Gaza who has relied on her faith amid the ongoing war. Worshippers perform the first taraweeh of Ramadan on the rubble of Al-Farouq Mosque in Rafah on March 10.

As the sunset call to prayer is heard across Gaza, families sit down to break their fast   surrounded by memories of what once was. “We are doing our best just to survive,” Owda said. “We don’t have the luxury of anything else.” “God is sufficient for me, and he is the best disposer of affairs.” Mirna Alsharif Mirna Alsharif is a breaking news reporter for NBC News.",

        "title": "Lakewood shooter ‘donated money to megachurch’ before attack that left son fighting for life",
        "description": "",
        "text": "Lakewood Church shooter Genesse Moreno  reportedly donated money to the Texas megachurch years before she took her seven-year-old son to the religious institution and opened fire inside. On Sunday, the 36-year-old walked into  Joel Osteen’s megachurch  around 1.50pm with her seven-year-old son and armed with an AR-15 rifle.  Inside, she began shooting in the hallway of the building, sending worshippers running for cover. Two off-duty police officers returned fire,  fatally shooting Moreno . Her seven-year-old son was also shot in the head amid the chaos.  Her son was rushed to hospital where he remains in critical condition. Another victim – a 57-year-old man – was also shot in the leg; he has since been released from the hospital. Years before the shooting, however, Moreno’s social media posts have revealed that she once sent money to the megachurch where she then chose to carry out her attack, CNN reported. Genesse Moreno in mug shot   ( Supplied ) In March 2020, she posted a screenshot of a letter from  Lakewood Church  thanking her for her donation. Moreno’s social media accounts have since been taken down.  The Independent  has reached out to the Houston Police Department for more information but has not been able to independently verify the post or the donation. The motive of the shooting remains unclear, but Houston Police Department Commander Christopher Hassig said that Moreno penned “ antisemitic writings ” prior to the shooting and was in the middle of a familial dispute with her ex-husband, whose family is Jewish. “We think this is where this stems from,” he said. The AR-15 used in the attack also had a sticker reading “Palestine” on it, police said. Police said that Moreno had a “documented mental health history” – something that has been echoed by her ex-husband’s family and divorce records. A woman who identified herself on Facebook as Moreno’s former mother-in-law said that Moreno “was taking medication for schizophrenia”. Divorce records from Montgomery County, obtained  by Fox26,  state that Moreno was diagnosed as “schizophrenic” and had a “history of erratic paranoid, stalking behaviour and was diagnosed as exhibiting Munchausen by proxy”. She once stored a loaded gun in her then-three-year-old son’s diaper bag, the records state. Police also said that Moreno went by several “aliases” including some male names.  Criminal records also identify her as Jeffery Escalante — with the middle name Genesse. Despite the male name, authorities said, through “all the investigation to this point, she has been identified the entire time as female”. Thr criminal records, seen by  The Independent , show Moreno had an expansive criminal history spanning from 2005 to 2022, including arrests including for assault, marijuana possession, forgery, theft, and unlawful carrying of a weapon. With the exception of the arrest pertaining to her alleged unlawful carrying of a weapon in 2022, all of the arrests are under the name Jeffery Escalante.",

        "title": "US House still has no Speaker. Here's what happens next",
        "text": "Jim Jordan's quest for the speakership of the House has been off to a rough start While the pick of the majority of House Republicans projected confidence at the beginning of this week, two rounds of balloting have exposed significant resistance to his bid for the gavel. On Tuesday, 20 of his fellow Republicans opted to support someone else. That number grew to 22 with a second vote on Wednesday, plunging his leadership bid into disarray. The Trump-backed congressman had chosen to hold these public votes as part of a strategy to flush out opposition. He hoped to expose the nay votes as just a handful of holdouts and put them on the record, where they would wilt under the spotlight. Instead, the strategy revealed the strength and determination of his opposition. Despite reporting that they have received death threats and faced other less severe means of pressure, Mr Jordan's Republican critics say they are united and undeterred. It sets up a standoff where, at some point, one side will have to give way. So what happens next? The Ohio congressman could continue to press for more Speaker votes. He has Mr Trump and much of the right-wing media ecosystem on his side, and can make life very uncomfortable for Republican politicians who are viewed as insufficiently loyal to the conservative cause. House in disarray as resistance hardens to Jordan Who is Speaker nominee Jim Jordan?  Threats fly as Jim Jordan's bid to be US House Speaker turns ugly Unlike Mr McCarthy, who in January faced an ideologically cohesive group of right-wing conservatives with specific, although difficult to satisfy, demands, Mr Jordan confronts a somewhat disparate group of opponents.  There's a knot of legislators from narrowly won districts in New York who may be fearful that Mr Jordan's brand of confrontational politics will damage their re-election chances. Another group includes key members of the House Appropriations Committee, including its chairwoman, Kay Granger. They might be worried about Mr Jordan's penchant for budget showdowns and resulting government shutdowns undermining their carefully negotiated and constructed government-funding legislation. The rest are an ideological hodgepodge from across the country, whose opposition ranges from tepid to vehement. Mr Jordan and his team will have to try to find ways to cajole or coerce his opponents into yielding while not doing so in a way that alienates his current crop of supporters. It will be no easy task.  Twenty votes is more than Kevin McCarthy, the recently ousted speaker, lost in his first ballot in January, during a process that stretched over several days and through 15 rounds of votes. It seems unlikely that Mr Jordan's fellow Republicans will give him that much time to secure the Speaker's gavel, given the current national and global circumstances. Mr Jordan can only afford to lose four Republican votes.  At some point, if Mr Jordan cannot demonstrate he is making progress towards winning the Speaker vote, Republicans are going to have to start looking for other options. Some have already floated giving Mr McCarthy, who was only narrowly unseated two weeks ago, another chance at the gavel. Since his ouster, no Republican candidate has matched his level of support among House Republicans. Another option being floated is to expand the powers of acting Speaker Patrick McHenry, allowing him to preside over urgent legislative matters, like approving aid to Israel after the Hamas attack. A majority of the House would probably have to approve this step, but some Democrats could go along if the scope of Mr McHenry's powers are clearly defined. They might demand concessions in exchange for their support, as well. Some centrist Republicans have also broached the possibility of working with Democrats to form a coalition that can elect a centrist compromise Speaker. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries has been open to such an effort, although he says that such a move will have to allow Democrats to advance some of their own legislative priorities. Otherwise, Republicans are left hoping that a new candidate can emerge who will pull their party together and willingly accept what Republican congressman Ken Buck of Colorado recently described as the \"worst job in America\".",

        "title": "Energy bills predicted to fall in April to £1,660",
        "text": "Annual energy bills for a typical household are expected to fall by £268 in April, a new forecast suggests. Consultancy firm Cornwall Insight says bills could drop to £1,660 under the official price cap set by the UK's energy regulator Ofgem. The energy price cap limits how much suppliers can charge households for each unit of energy they use. Analysts at Cornwall said a significant decline in wholesale energy prices would lead to the drop in April. The predicted fall comes as millions are set to see bills rise in January when the next price cap comes into force. Energy regulator Ofgem said the typical dual-fuel annual household bill would go up from £1,834 to £1,928 in January, a rise of £94. In its latest forecast, Cornwall said it expected bills to continue to fall throughout the year, falling to £1,590 in July before a slight increase to £1,640 from October. It said the Israel-Hamas conflict, strikes at a liquified natural gas plant in Australia and disruption at a gas pipeline in Finland had so far \"failed to materially impact energy supplies\". These factors, coupled with a relatively mild winter to date, have left European gas storage levels above expectations for the remainder of winter, helping to drive down wholesale prices, Cornwall analysts said. Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at the group, said the dip \"may offer a small light at the end of the tunnel\".  \"The recent stabilisation of international energy markets has trickled down to April's price cap predictions, raising hopes that this downward path will continue throughout the remainder of 2024,\" he said.  Energy bills could rise to cover customers' debts Energy firms must help customers with unpaid bills Calls for targeted energy help for most vulnerable But reflecting on the \"highly volatile\" wholesale energy market and \"unexpected global events,\" Dr Lowrey said \"there are no guarantees the price cap will not rise again\". \"Ongoing consultations on potential changes to the price cap, including the standing charge and bad debt collection\" he said, could impact the overall price cap level too. \"Ultimately, waiting and hoping that we will avoid another global incident that sends energy prices climbing is not a sustainable strategy for government\". The energy watchdog, Ofgem, sets a maximum price that suppliers can charge customers per unit of gas and electricity. The regulator's price cap affects 29 million households in England, Wales and Scotland. Rules are different in  Northern Ireland . Ofgem sets the maximum amount that suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity but not the total bill, so if you use more, you will pay more. To shield people in England, Wales and Scotland from much higher bills last year, the government introduced a £400 discount for each household, but that scheme has now finished. But new Ofgem rules which came in on 14 December, require companies to contact vulnerable customers if they miss two monthly or one quarterly payment and check to see if they are having financial problems with their bills. Energy firms must help by offering affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if appropriate. It comes as households face paying extra on energy bills to cover customers' bad debts under plans by the industry regulator. Ofgem has proposed lifting the energy price cap by £16 between April next year and March 2025. It estimates that debt levels for energy customers has risen to £2.9bn.",

        "title": "The New Hampshire-Canada border is small, but patrols are about to increase in a big way",
        "text": "CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — New Hampshire announced a tenfold increase in patrols along the Canadian border Thursday, with Republican leaders promising to use state and local law enforcement to close what they consider a potentially dangerous gap in public safety. “There’s national security implications to securing the northern border that are becoming more and more obvious every day,” Gov. Chris Sununu said at a news conference. “In light of the terrorist attacks by  Hamas  aimed at innocent Israelis, global tensions and threats are now at an all-time high.” Along with Attorney General John Formella, Sununu outlined how the state will use $1.4 million included in the current state budget to create the Northern Border Alliance Task Force. Formella said the partnership between state, county and local law enforcement will increase border patrol hours from roughly 55 per month to a total of 10,000 hours in the next 18 months. \n     \n\n Statistics from U.S. Customs and Border Protection show that agents in the 295-mile (475-kilometer) sector that includes New Hampshire, Vermont and parts of upstate New York apprehended 5,970 illegal border crossers between Oct. 1, 2022, through Aug. 31, 2023, up from 829 in the same period the year before. The total number apprehended along the entire northern border during that time, 170,565, is a small fraction of those apprehended along the  U.S.-Mexican border  during that same period, 2.1 million. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n             \n                 \n                    RELATED COVERAGE\n                 \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Canada’s Liberal Party to decide on March 9 who will succeed Trudeau as prime minister \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Indiana man who fled to avoid prison sentence for storming Capitol is arrested in Canada \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 US orange juice and steel will be on Canada’s list for retaliation if Trump imposes tariffs \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n New Hampshire borders Canada for less than 60 miles (97 kilometers), and it’s unclear how many illegal crossings happen there. Sununu said action is needed given that encounters with people on the terrorist watch list along the northern border as a whole have increased. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n “We can’t stand by, and we won’t,” Sununu said. “We’re going to do whatever we can to make sure that we’re providing the necessary resources and security for our citizens.” \n     \n\n Last spring, when lawmakers were debating the budget provision, the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire filed a lawsuit seeking release of state-specific data about border crossings. Frank Knaack, the organization’s policy director, said Thursday the $1.4 million would be better invested in housing, broadband and substance use treatment than expanding police power and surveillance under the guise of a border crisis. “Policies like this have been shown in study after study to further undermine police and community trust, which makes our communities less safe,” he said. “Make no mistake: we’ll be watching the actions of law enforcement, including how every dollar is spent, very closely.” Formella said he would provide as much transparency as possible without compromising investigations. The task force, which will include state police, forest rangers, Fish and Game officers and county and local law enforcement, will patrol within 25 miles (40 kilometers) of the border. Members will cooperate with federal officers to enforce federal immigration laws. Most of New Hampshire’s border with Canada is in the town of Pittsburg, where Police Chief Rick Dube said there have been issues, though he declined to describe specific instances. “It’s a cat-and-mouse game. You got to be in the right spot at the right time. They could be in the woods, and it’s so dense up there, they can be 5 feet away from you, 10 feet away from you and you can walk right by them,” he said. “It’s a struggle.”",

        "text": "When it comes to consumer spending bonanzas, Halloween isn’t Christmas but it’s inching closer. Americans are expected to shell out a  record $12.2 billion  on Halloween candy, costumes and decorations, topping pre-COVID levels, according to the National Retail Federation. The previous all-time high was $9.1 billion in 2017. Partly driving the spooky spending spree is a sugar shortage that’s nudging candy prices higher as well as inflation overall. Costumes are projected to bring in the most revenue at $4.1 billion. Amazon Prime Day, the sequel, is here So you thought Amazon Prime Day sales only happened in July. So 2022.

        "description": "",
        "text": "A builder has been forced into hiding after receiving a torrent of abusive messages from people wrongly mistaking him for a man involved in a viral video of an alleged racial attack at  London  Waterloo. Edward Jackson has been 'living in a nightmare' and had to move his family out of their home and call in police after wrongly being identified on social media  for abusing pro-Palestine campaigners .  The 36-year-old said he has faced a relentless campaign of abuse, receiving a barrage of calls, emails and fake reviews for his business. He believes his firm - JT Construction Services - shares a similar name to a company run by one of the suspects who was arrested over the 'racially aggravated' confrontation last week. He said: 'It's been pretty horrific to be honest. I just want everyone to know it's nothing to do with me, I've had to change my website and try and get the message out that it's nothing to do with me.'              Edward Jackson (pictured) was wrongly being identified on social media as one of the four men filmed allegedly abusing pro-Palestine campaigners at London Waterloo          Pictured are four of the men recorded during the alleged encounter at the railway station                   EXCLUSIVE  \n   Mr Jackson, from Sturminster Marshall, Dorset, is the second innocent man to be wrongly accused over the video.  Northampton tradesman Jamie Turner, whose business is JT Landscaping, has also been mistakenly identified on social media. Mr Jackson said the abuse he received started on Sunday night after video of a group of men shouting racist obscenities of pro-Palestine campaigners was posted on X, formerly  Twitter . He said one caller said they would come to his house and 'sort him out' which prompted the married father-of-two to move his family out. He said: 'At 10.30pm Sunday night the phone started going mad. 'I thought it might have been a customer so I answered and I just got a load of abuse, basically telling me I was a racist and they are coming after me and they know where I live and know all about me. 'It got so bad that people started saying they would cut me up and stab me. 'On Monday the phone just didn't stop ringing all day, I had about 80 calls regarding this now and have received a load of fake reviews on Google which is damaging the business. I almost went into hiding and couldn't return to the family home. 'All the fake reviews aren't helping. I'm worried my customers are going to see things and we all jump to conclusions, don't we?  'A lot of the fake reviews were saying stuff like I run off with people's money and I don't pay deposits and leave jobs half done, all comments that look bad on the business.'              Three of the men are pictured during the alleged encounter at London Waterloo               Mr Jackson believes his firm - JT Construction Services - shares a similar name to a company run by one of the suspects (Mr Jackson is pictured by his company van) He posted on the JT Construction Services Facebook page: 'Living in a nightmare the last few days because people in this world can be so cruel. 'Ed's business got caught up in a racial hate for a local Christchurch guy who was involved with the Waterloo racism at the weekend because their companies were similar. 'Please can you share this and get the word out that we have and never be part of something so awful, so we can re-build our business and hopefully feel safe again in our home'.

        "title": "9 are facing charges in what police in Canada say is the biggest gold theft in the country’s history",
        "text": "TORONTO (AP) — Police said nine people are facing charges in what authorities are calling  the biggest gold theft in Canadian history  from Toronto’s Pearson International airport a year ago. Peel Regional Police said Wednesday that 6,600 gold bars worth more than 20 million Canadian dollars ($14.5 million), and CA$2.5 million ($1.8 million) in foreign currencies were stolen. The gold was melted down and used to purchase illegal firearms, police said. Those charged include an Air Canada warehouse employee and a former Air Canada manager who gave police a tour of cargo of the facility after the theft. A jewelry store owner is also charged.  “This story is a sensational one and which probably, we jokingly say, belongs in a Netflix series,” Peel Regional Chief Nishan Duraiappah said. \n    \n     \n\n\n    \n     \n     \n \n     \n         \n                 \n             \n         \n                 \n             \n     \n     \n         \n         \n     \n     \n \n    \n    \n     \n        AP AUDIO: 9 are facing charges in what police in Canada say is the biggest gold theft in the country’s history.\n     \n    \n    \n     AP correspondent Karen Chammas reports on the biggest gold theft in Canadian history. \n    \n Peel Regional Detective Sgt. Mike Mavity said the gold bars, weighing 419 kilograms (923 pounds), and foreign currency, ordered from a refinery in Zurich, Switzerland, were transported in the haul of an Air Canada flight on April 17 last year.  \n     \n\n He said that late afternoon a truck driver arrived at the airline’s cargo warehouse with a fraudulent bill that was provided to an airline warehouse attendant. Mavity said a bill for seafood that was picked up the day before was used to pick up the gold. The duplicate bill was printed off at the Air Canada warehouse, he said.  “They needed people within Air Canada to facilitate this theft,” Mavity said in front of the truck police say was used in the theft.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Mavity said police are searching for the Air Canada manager who gave police a tour of the facility in the days after the theft.

He said they seized six crudely made bracelets made of gold. “I don’t think I ever imagined they would have to deal with the largest gold heist in Canadian history,” said Patrick Brown, the mayor of Brampton, Ontario. “It’s almost out of an ‘Ocean’s Eleven’ movie or CSI.” \n     \n\n Air Canada employee Parmpal Sidhu, 54, from Brampton, Ontario, jewelry store owner Ali Raza, 37, from Toronto, Amit Jalota, 40, a Oakville, Ontario resident, Ammad Chaudhary, 43, from Georgetown, Ontario and Prasath Paramalingam, 35, from Brampton are among those that have been arrested. Mavity said they have been released on bail conditions and will be in court at a later date.  Mavity said the truck driver that allegedly picked up the gold, Durante King-Mclean, a 25-year-old from Brampton, is currently in custody in the U.S. on firearms and trafficking related charges.  Police are searching for former Air Canada manager Simran Preet Panesar, 31, from Brampton as well as Archit Grover, 36, from Brampton and Arsalan Chaudhary, 42, from Mississauga Ontario.  Peel Regional Deputy Chief Nick Milinovich said only CA$90,000 ($65,000) of the more than CA$20 million has been recovered.  U.S. ATF Special Agent, Eric DeGree, said King-Mclean, was arrested in Pennsylvania after a traffic stop and that led to the seizure of 65 illegal firearms that were allegedly destined to be smuggled into Canada. DeGree said he tried to flee after police discovered the firearms in his rental car.  \n     \n\n Brinks, an American cash handling company, arrived at the airport cargo facility the night of April 17 to pick up the gold and were told the gold and currency was missing after a search.  Brinks sued Air Canada over the theft last year. According to the company’s filing last year, a thief walked away with the costly cargo after presenting a fake document at an Air Canada warehouse on April 17.  In a Nov. 8 statement of defense, Air Canada rejected “each and every allegation” in the Brink’s lawsuit, saying it fulfilled its carriage contracts and denying any improper or “careless” conduct. The country’s largest airline also said Brink’s failed to note the value of the haul on the waybill — a document typically issued by a carrier with details of the shipment — and that if Brink’s did suffer losses, a multilateral treaty known as the Montreal Convention would cap Air Canada’s liability.  \n     \n\n In Federal Court filings that claim breach of contract and millions of dollars in damages, Brinks said an “unidentified individual” gained access to the airline’s cargo warehouse and presented a “fraudulent” waybill shortly after an Air Canada flight from Zurich landed at Pearson. The statement of the claim says the staff then handed over 400 kilograms of gold in the form of 24 bars plus nearly $2 million in cash to the thief, who promptly “absconded with the cargo.” DeGree said dozens of firearms were seized, including two fully automatic weapons and five guns that were untraceable. “I’m proud to say that we successfully put an international gun trafficking operation out of business. We kept 65 firearms off the streets of Canada and prevented them from being used in any number of crimes,” DeGree said. Mavity said that “we believe they melted down the gold and with the profits they got from the gold they used to purchase illegal firearms.”",

        "title": "Newspaper headlines: Conflicting Gaza death accounts and police vetting failures",
        "text": "The dramatic political comeback of George Galloway presents Sir Keir Starmer with another headache -  according to the Sun ,  external  in its online coverage.   The paper says the left-wing firebrand and former Big Brother contestant focused on Gaza as he gallivanted through mosques across Rochdale, to seize the support of its Muslim population.   The Times says ,  external  the campaign was one of the most divisive in recent years.   The Guardian uses ,  external  the same word to describe Mr Galloway.  It says he was so confident of victory that shortly after the polls closed, he'd briefed reporters that he'd won comfortably, before announcing plans for a mass rally.  The Daily Telegraph covers the spat ,  external  between Rochdale's new MP and the leader of the Reform Party, Richard Tice - who claims that his candidate and campaigners suffered abuse and death threats.  Mr Galloway rejects the suggestion his supporters engaged in bad behaviour - saying that Mr Tice had \"rather lost his balance\".   The front page picture of  the Guardian captures  ,  external the aftermath of the chaos in Gaza.  It shows three Palestinian men holding a body, which is wrapped in a white sheet.  The paper says there are \"starkly different accounts\" of how the deaths occurred.   The Times believes ,  external  the tragedy will almost certainly end hopes of a six week ceasefire.  In an analysis piece, it says Israel is dependent on the Biden administration for arms and diplomatic support - and the moment where America pushes the brakes seems near. There's widespread condemnation of the errors made by the Metropolitan Police, which led to the appointment of Wayne Couzens to the Diplomatic Protection Squad -- before he kidnapped and murdered the marketing executive, Sarah Everard.  Sarah Vine  in the Daily Mail says ,  external  it would have been hard-wired into Ms Everard's brain that a policeman was someone she could trust and that it sets her blood boiling, that she met a monster.   The Sun is equally condemnatory ,  external  describing officers responsible for vetting recruits as \"simply useless, lazy and lethargic.\" \"Britain's broken borders\" is  the headline in the Mail ,  external .  It says the official reviews which were carried out by the sacked immigration chief, David Neal, expose shocking failings with the migration system - with airport passport checkpoints left unmanned.  In an editorial, the paper accuses the government of trying to bury bad news by releasing the findings when all eyes were trained on the report into Couzens.  The Home Office said the publication was \"itself a demonstration of transparency\". According to the Daily Telegraph ,  external , Vladimir Putin is trying to destabilise Europe by flooding the West with migrants, to try to influence elections.  It says that it's seen intelligence documents suggesting that Russia is using thousands of former militias in Libya to \"weaponise\" immigration.  It says Mr Putin, who is increasingly isolated, is moving migrants to Europe's doorstep, along Russia's eastern borders and through proxies in the south, including Africa.        Several of the papers mark the death of the Hairy Bikers star, Dave Myers, at the age off 66.  The motorcycling chef, who had cancer, is pictured  on the front of the Daily Star ,  external  with his co-star Si King.  It prints the words he used to pay tribute to Dave Myers: \"My best friend is on a journey that, for now, I can't follow.\" Sign up for our morning newsletter  and get BBC News in your inbox.",

        "description": "The First Minister said it was ‘shameful’ that the Foreign Secretary had not included the interests of trapped UK citizens among his objectives.",
        "text": "The  First Minister  has criticised the Foreign Secretary for failing to include helping UK nationals escape from the fighting in  Gaza  as a priority in his approach to the conflict there. In a post on X – formerly Twitter – James Cleverly said his objectives relating to the conflict between  Israel  and  Hamas  were to secure the release of British hostages, stop violence spreading to other parts of the Middle East and ensure emergency aid can get to Gaza. Responding to the post with on of his own,  Humza Yousaf , whose Dundee-based in-laws are currently trapped in Gaza, urged Mr Cleverly to call for a ceasefire and the opening of the Rafah crossing in the south of the Gaza Strip. He said: “Shameful that UK citizens trapped in Gaza don’t even get a mention. {\"data\":{\"id\":\"1715029832277373070\"}} “Might be helpful if you give them at least a passing mention in your discussions. “They’re trapped in a warzone & need you, Foreign Secretary, to demand a ceasefire, and the Rafah crossing opened to let them out.” His comments come after the First Minister said his brother-in-law was refusing to go home and rest – despite working for seven consecutive days as a doctor in Gaza – because people “need me”. In a post on X earlier on Thursday, the First Minister shared a video of bloodied children being treated by medical personnel. In a message, Mr Yousaf said his wife, Nadia El-Nakla, had implored her brother to go home and rest after working for a week straight. The First Minister wrote: “My brother-in-law, a doctor in Gaza, is spending his seventh consecutive day in hospital. {\"data\":{\"id\":\"1714926781625405942\"}} “Nadia spoke to him & said he should go home to rest, his response: ‘I can’t leave my people when they need me’. “Health workers in Gaza are heroes.” It comes after Mr Yousaf told broadcasters, last week, his brother-in-law had been forced to decide who to treat due to a lack of medical supplies. Mr Yousaf and Ms El-Nakla have spoken at length about their fears for family in the region. Ms El-Nakla’s parents, Elizabeth and Maged, visited family in Gaza in the week before the Hamas attack on Israel. On Wednesday, SNP MP Chris Law told the House of Commons that Elizabeth El-Nakla had said her final goodbyes in a call with her daughter and the First Minister that morning. According to the MP, she said: “Last night was the end for me, better if my heart stops and then I will be at peace, I can’t take another night.” Mr Yousaf also used his first address to the SNP conference as leader this week to call for the UK Government to set up a refugee resettlement scheme for those seeking to flee Gaza, stating that Scotland could be the first place to take people in.",

        "title": "How Lebanon’s Hezbollah group became a critical player in the Israel-Hamas war",
        "text": "BEIRUT (AP) — When the Lebanese militia Hezbollah announced last week that its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, would deliver his first public speech since the outbreak of the  Israel-Hamas war , much of the region held its breath. Would Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the Arab world’s most powerful paramilitary force, continue its limited  exchanges of fire  with Israel or throw itself wholeheartedly into the war? In Lebanon, streets emptied as people sat glued to their screens to watch, ready to parse his words along with decision-makers in Israel and across the Mideast. Hezbollah has  traded fire with Israeli troops  along the border since the day after  Hamas’ Oct. 7 surprise attack  in southern Israel sparked war in the Gaza Strip. Both sides have suffered casualties, but the fear is that the  conflict will escalate  and spiral into a regional fight. \n     \n\n Nasrallah nodded to those concerns in  his speech Friday . “Some say I’m going to announce that we have entered the battle,” he said. “We already entered the battle on Oct. 8.” But he stopped short of saying Hezbollah would more fully join the fight. Here’s a look at why Hezbollah and its leader are key players in the trajectory of the Israel-Hamas war. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n WHAT IS HEZBOLLAH?  Shiite Muslim Hezbollah is one of a collection of Iranian-backed groups and governments in the region known as the Axis of Resistance. Founded in 1982 during Lebanon’s civil war, Hezbollah’s initial objective was ending Israel’s occupation of southern Lebanon, which it eventually achieved in 2000. It was the first group Iran invested in to export its brand of political Islamism. In its early days, the group also carried out attacks on U.S. targets, causing Washington to designate it a terrorist organization. “Iran’s support has helped Hezbollah consolidate its position as Lebanon’s most powerful political actor as well as the most equipped military actor supported by Iran in the whole of the Middle East,” Lina Khatib, the director of the SOAS Middle East Institute in London, told The Associated Press. \n     \n\n After a Hezbollah fighters ambushed an Israeli patrol in 2006 and took two Israeli soldiers hostage, Hezbollah and Israel fought a monthlong war that ended in a draw — but not before Israeli bombardment wreaked widespread destruction in southern Lebanon. At the time, Israel’s objective was similar to its current war with Hamas: eliminate Hezbollah. Instead, the group came out stronger — not only an armed force but also a key political party in Lebanon. However, domestic opponents criticized Hezbollah for maintaining its arsenal and dominating the government. Its reputation also suffered when it briefly seized a section of Beirut in May 2008 after the Lebanese government took measures against its private telecommunications network. \n     \n\n WHO IS HASSAN NASRALLAH?  Born in 1960 into a poor Shiite family in the Beirut suburb of Bourj Hammoud and later displaced to south Lebanon, Nasrallah studied theology and joined the Amal movement, a Shiite political and paramilitary organization, before becoming one of Hezbollah’s founders. He became Hezbollah’s leader in 1992 after his predecessor was killed in an Israeli strike. Nasrallah now stands as one of the most powerful political figures in Lebanon.  Idolized by many for presiding over Israel’s withdrawal from the south and leading the 2006 war, his image appears on billboards and on gadgets in souvenir shops in Lebanon, Syria and other countries across the Arab world. But he also faces opposition among Lebanese who accuse him of tying their country’s fate to Iran.  Nasrallah is also considered to be pragmatic, able to make political compromises.  He has lived in hiding for years, fearing Israeli assassination, and delivers his speeches from undisclosed locations. HOW DOES HEZBOLLAH COMPARE TO OTHER IRANIAN-BACKED GROUPS?  Hezbollah is the Arab world’s most significant paramilitary force with a robust internal structure as well as a sizeable arsenal. Israel estimates it has an arsenal of 150,000 precision-guided missiles.  In recent years, Hezbollah sent forces to Syria to help fellow Iranian ally President Bashar Assad against armed opposition groups. It also supported the growth of Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, Yemen and Syria.  Khatib likened Hezbollah to a “big brother” of fledgling Iranian-backed groups that “do not enjoy the same level of infrastructure or discipline.” \n     \n\n WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEZBOLLAH AND HAMAS?  While Hezbollah is bound to Iran by doctrine, its relationship with Hamas is based on pragmatism. The Palestinian militant group was founded in 1987 as an offshoot of the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood movement. Its political and financial backing from Iran and Syria did not pick up until 2006. A schism erupted between Hamas and the Iranian-backed axis over the Syrian civil war, where Hamas for some time backed Syria’s largely Sunni opposition fighters.  Despite differences over Syria, “over the past five years, relations improved at a fast pace,” said Qassim Qassir, a Lebanese analyst close to Hezbollah. \n     \n\n Although many top Hamas officials lived in Qatar and Turkey, which backed the Syrian opposition, the group’s return to the Iranian fold put them in a tricky situation.  Some Hamas officials, including its second-in-command, Saleh al-Arouri, have since moved to Lebanon, where they have Hezbollah’s protection and a presence across Lebanon’s multiple Palestinian refugee camps. HOW FAR IS HEZBOLLAH WILLING TO GO TO PROTECT HAMAS? For Hezbollah, fully entering the Israel-Hamas war would risk dragging Lebanon — beset by economic calamity and internal political tensions — into a conflict it can ill afford, fueling domestic opposition to the group. But staying on the sidelines as Israeli troops take control of  the Gaza Strip  could compromise Hezbollah’s credibility, and a Hamas defeat would be a blow to Iran. Hezbollah’s steady pressure on Israel’s northern border shows support for Hamas and keeps open the threat of a wider intervention. Qassir interpreted the message behind Nasrallah’s speech as: “If you don’t want the regional war to expand, then the war (in Gaza) has to stop.” But it’s unclear how long Hezbollah can maintain this delicate balancing act, with Israel seemingly determined to crush Hamas and the  Palestinian death toll  in Gaza passing 10,000.  “If there is a full collapse in Gaza and things reach a point where they have to be fully involved, then they’re ready,” Qassir said.",

        "text": "The White House on Monday pushed back against claims President Biden apologized for using the term “illegal” to describe  the migrant accused of killing Laken Riley  — just days after the president said he  had “regret” for using the loaded term . \n\n\n\n Biden, 81, had received a deluge of backlash from Democrats — including Nancy Pelosi — after using the word “illegal” when speaking about the 22-year-old nursing student’s alleged killer during his State of the Union address.  \n\n\n\n The president then appeared to backtrack in an interview that aired on MSNBC Sunday, saying he had “regret” for using “illegal” instead of the more neutral “undocumented.” \n\n\n\n But White House deputy spokesperson Olivia Dalton attempted to clarify on Monday, telling a reporter that “the president absolutely did not apologize” despite his expression of regret.  \n\n\n\n “There was no apology anywhere in that conversation,” Dalton told reporters on Air Force One. “He did not apologize. He used a different word.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) prompted him to speak about Riley. \n\n\n\n Dalton then said it was “unconscionable” how “some people” are “playing politics with this young woman’s tragic murder.” She also slammed House Republicans for “standing in the way of a bipartisan border security agreement” due to pressure from GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump.   \n\n\n\n Biden has called on House Republicans  to pass the bipartisan bill that would give him greater authority to deal with the border.

        "title": "Palestinian militants kill 2 alleged informers for Israel and mob drags bodies through camp alleys",
        "text": "JERUSALEM (AP) — Palestinian militants in a West Bank refugee camp shot and killed two alleged collaborators with Israel early Saturday, Palestinian officials said. Mobs then kicked the bloodied corpses and dragged them through alleys before trying to tie them to an electrical tower. The scenes, widely shared on social media, were reminiscent of the chaos  in the occupied West Bank  during two Palestinian uprisings against Israeli rule that erupted in 1987 and in 2000, respectively, each lasting several years. During these periods of heightened conflict, there were frequent  killings of alleged informers,  at times with bodies displayed in public. Saturday’s killings in the Tulkarem refugee camp laid bare the pressures tearing at Palestinian society as  the Israel-Hamas war  worsens what has already been a bloody year for the territory. Deadly Israeli military raids,  settler attacks  and Palestinian militancy in the West Bank have surged since Israel mounted its devastating offensive in Gaza in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7 bloody rampage through southern Israel.  \n     \n\n Over 230 Palestinian have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank in the past seven weeks alone, most of them during Israeli army raids targeting militants. On Saturday, Israeli forces raided the northern Palestinian town of Qabatiya seeking to arrest militants, sparking a firefight and killing a locally prominent doctor, 25-year-old Shamekh Abu al-Rub, Palestinian health officials said. Abu al-Rub was the son of Kamal Abu al-Rub, governor of the Palestinian city of Jenin. \n    \n \n\n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n In the Tulkarem refugee camp, a local militant group accused two Palestinians of helping Israeli security forces target the group in a major army raid that killed three key militants on Nov. 6, a Palestinian security officer said. The two alleged informers were in their late 20s and early 30s, respectively, and one was from the camp, said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. \n     \n\n A second Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity for the same reason, confirmed that Palestinian security forces were aware of the incident. The public prosecutor’s office said it would have details in the coming days about a police investigation into the killings. The local militant group — affiliated with the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, an armed offshoot of the secular nationalist Fatah party — posted a cryptic statement just after the two men were reported killed. “We did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves,” it said.  The family of one of the accused informers sought to distance itself in a statement Saturday, calling its disgraced relative a “malicious finger that we have cut off without regret.”  \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n             \n                 \n                    More Israel-Hamas War coverage\n                 \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Israel and Hamas complete 2nd day of swaps after tense delay, as Gaza cease-fire holds \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                    \n                    \n                       \n                 \n             \n            \n             \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Lebanese residents of border towns come back during a fragile cease-fire between Hamas and Israel \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                    \n                    \n                       \n                 \n             \n            \n             \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Tens of thousands march in London calling for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                    \n                    \n                       \n                 \n             \n            \n             \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n     \n \n\n “We affirm our complete innocence,” the family added, “and we won’t allow anyone to blame us for his guilt.” A Palestinian journalist in the camp, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said residents of the camp beat and stomped on the corpses after the two were shot and killed by militants in the streets. Videos show hundreds of Palestinians flocking to the entrance of the camp, gawking and filming with their phones as men try to hang the mutilated corpses from an electrical tower. \n     \n\n It apparently proved too difficult and residents ended up tossing the bodies over the walls of a U.N. school in the camp, tying their feet to a chain link fence, the journalist said. They were not taken to the hospital, she said. Purported confession videos surfaced online showing the two men, worn out, their eyes downcast, describing their recent interactions with Israeli intelligence officials who they said paid them thousands of dollars for information. Israel’s Shin Bet security service has a long history of pressuring Palestinians to become informers, including by blackmail or by promising work or entry permits for Israel. The Shin Bet did not respond to a request for comment on the killings.",

        "description": "American officials said that they had “worked closely” with Israelis as they developed the seaport initiative, but they did not specify whether Israel would provide direct assistance or support for its construction or operation.",
        "text": "Written by David E. Sanger, Michael D. Shear and Thomas Fuller Facing warnings that the war-ravaged Gaza Strip is on the precipice of widespread famine, the United States on Thursday announced plans for a large-scale, amphibious military operation in the Mediterranean Sea that would ferry food and other aid to desperate civilians in the enclave. The White House called it an “emergency mission” that would allow hundreds of truckloads of additional aid to be delivered to Gaza via the temporary port, which would be attached to some kind of temporary causeway. Briefing reporters, officials said it could take more than 30 to 60 days to implement and involve hundreds or thousands of U.S. troops on ships just off shore, in keeping with President  Joe Biden ’s mandate that no American soldiers be on the ground inside Gaza as the conflict rages. The port would be constructed in cooperation with other countries in the region, the officials said. American officials said that they had “worked closely” with Israelis as they developed the seaport initiative, but they did not specify whether Israel would provide direct assistance or support for its construction or operation. Shani Sasson, a spokesperson for COGAT, the Israeli agency which regulates aid to Palestinians in Gaza, did not respond to a request for comment. One Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic negotiations, said that under the latest plan, aid donated by the United Arab Emirates would be sent to Cyprus, where it would eventually be inspected, then transported by ship to the coast of Gaza. The new facility could provide another way to get truckloads of aid into the region. But it would not solve a central problem of distributing aid inside Gaza while intense fighting and Israeli bombing continues in the south and as lawlessness in the north has grown so bad that aid groups suspended operations there. Until now, the United States has pressured Israel to allow more aid into Gaza through two border crossings and recently joined France and Jordan in airdropping aid from planes, including 38,000 meals Thursday. The United Nations has warned that more than 570,000 Palestinians are facing “catastrophic levels of deprivation and starvation.” It is unclear where the Biden administration intends to build its new floating port or pier off Gaza. Based on the description provided by White House and military officials, this one would be built from US ships and then moved close to shore.

Prerequisites: — What is Hezbollah? — Read about the Israel-Hezbollah conflict.  — What was the Arab-Israeli war?  —  Map work:  Location of Lebanon, Israel, Iran, West Bank, Gaza strip. Key takeaways:  — The Israeli military said on Saturday it had eliminated Nasrallah in the strike on the group’s central command headquarters in Beirut’s southern suburbs on Friday. Hezbollah confirmed he had been killed, without saying how. — Nasrallah’s death is a major blow to both Hezbollah and Iran, removing an influential ally who helped build Hezbollah into the linchpin of Tehran’s network of allied groups in the Arab world. — Iran later called for a United Nations Security Council meeting on Israel’s actions in Lebanon and elsewhere in the region. It also warned against any attacks on its diplomatic facilities and representatives. — Hezbollah and Israel have been fighting a conflict in parallel with Israel’s war against the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza since Hamas’ attack on Israel last Oct. 7, in a cross-border confrontation that has sharply escalated in recent days. From “ His death breaks Iran axis into more erratic parts ” — Nasrallah’s death marks an unprecedented blow to Iran’s regional instruments of influence. Given his unparalleled prominence in the pantheon of Iranian resistance leaders, Nasrallah’s killing is arguably a bigger loss to Iran than even Major  General Qassem Soleimani  of the Revolutionary Guards, in 2020, and Hamas’ political chief Ismail Haniyeh earlier this year. — The rapid depletion of Iran’s strategic human resources in its ‘axis of resistance’, is bound to set a regional re-arrangement in motion, since Tehran is the only prominent opponent of the pro-Israel drift in Middle Eastern politics in recent years.  —  The Iranian card in the Middle East is a spoiler for India. Even as Tehran and New Delhi continue their point focus on developing Chabahar, Iran’s value in India’s strategic calculus has plummeted, adding to the historic strain of Western sanctions on anything India-Iran and the struggling pace of the International North South Transport Corridor.  — For India, a weakened Iranian axis of resistance means fewer sources of disruption to its grand regional connectivity plans; without requiring changes in its traditional principled support for the two-state solution. India believes that the Palestine question can be resolved through Arab-Israeli negotiations, sans a third-party disruptor.  From the World Page “Why Nasrallah’s killing has West Asia on the edge”  Shubhajit Roy writes– “7 takeaways from Israel’s attack on Hezbollah chief Hasan Nasrallah 1. A seismic episode, in its context potentially as big as the killing of Osama bin Laden.  Hezbollah under Nasrallah has been by far the most powerful of the armed groups opposing Israel. His killing has ended one of the most serious military threats to the Jewish nation. 2. Israel has taken out the bulk of Hezbollah’s senior leadership. 3. Hezbollah is the strongest of the Iran-backed ‘Axis of Resistance’; Nasrallah’s killing is a power moment for Israel. 4. Hezbollah has suffered a debilitating setback, but much will depend on how Iran — its main backer and the arch rival of Israel — reacts now. 5. This could be a significant moment for Lebanon as well. For decades, Hezbollah has been the most powerful entity in a country with chronically weak power structures. While there were protests in the streets by people mourning Nasrallah on Saturday, his killing also presents an opportunity for Lebanon to loosen some of Hezbollah’s iron grip on the country. 6. Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar have a key role to play going forward. 7. For India, an early return of peace in the region works best. Like its partners in West Asia, especially, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, New Delhi would want stability to return soon, so that they can go back to the connectivity initiatives like the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, and work on the prosperity of the region and beyond. For Your Information: — Hezbollah, meaning “Party of God”, is a Shiite militant organisation that was set up by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards in 1982 to fight Israeli forces that had invaded Lebanon that year.  — Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRCG):  It was set up in 1979. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, a theocratic state was established in Iran following the removal of the ruling Shah from power. For its protection, the IRCG was created to deal with both domestic and external threats. Points to Ponder:  — What is the “axis of resistance”? — What is the significance of West Asia for India? — What do recent developments in the middle east mean for India’s Middle East policy? — What impact could tensions in the Middle East have on the India? Post Read Question: (1) Consider the following statements: 1. The Quds Force is the paramilitary and intelligence wing of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRCG). 2. IRCG was created to deal with external threats only. Which of the statement(s) given above is/are not correct? (a) 1 only (b) 2 only (c) Both 1 and 2 (d) Neither 1 Nor 2 Other Important Articles Covering the same topic: What is Hezbollah and what do we know about its military capabilities?

Niti Aayog, the top think tank of the government, had opposed some of the provisions of the law, and particularly red flagged the changes proposed to the Right to Information (RTI) Act that could “weaken” the legislation. Prerequisites: — What is the Digital Personal Data Protection Act? — Read about the Right to Information (RTI) Act.  —  Organisation to look for : Niti Aayog Key takeaways:  — In simple words, what the data protection law proposed is an amendment to a section in the RTI Act with such effect that disclosure of personal information about public officials would not be allowed even when these are justified in larger public interest. — On January 16, 2023, the Niti Aayog formally wrote to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) urging it to not pass the proposed law in its current form as it could weaken the  RTI Act , and suggested the Bill be amended and fresh opinion sought, records reviewed by  The Indian Express  as part of an RTI application showed. — Niti Aayog’s suggestions had come as part of the then ongoing inter-ministerial consultations, and the law was still in its draft stage. The Bill was passed in Parliament in August 2023 and received the President’s assent the same month, but all through the process, MeitY kept the proposed changes to the RTI Act unchanged despite the reservations of Niti Aayog. As of now, the law is yet to be operationalised, with necessary rules for its implementation awaited. — The reason for Niti Aayog’s caution is a single line in the data protection law, that is rather easy to miss as a footnote. The law proposes to amend Section 8(1)(j) of the Right to Information Act, 2005. This prevents a public authority from sharing anyone’s personal information on two main grounds – that the disclosure will have no bearing on any public activity, and that revealing such information would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual, unless such disclosure is justified in larger public interest. — However, the law proposes that the personal information of public officials will not be disclosed under the RTI Act. The two key grounds, that such information could be disclosed provided it serves a larger public interest, have been done away with. For Your Information:  —  The Right to Information (RTI) Act is often hailed as the most important piece of legislation for empowering the common citizen. It mandates timely response to citizen requests for government information.  Points to Ponder:  — What are the potential benefits of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act? — What are the laws related to data governance in India? — What are the issues and challenges associated with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act? — What measures should be taken to ensure data privacy and cyber security? Post Read Question: Prelims  (2) With reference to the Data Protection Board (DPB), consider the following statements: 1. It will be established through the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP), 2023 2. The board will have quasi-judicial powers. 3.

What’s the ongoing story-  Maintaining that Pakistan’s GDP can only be measured in terms of “radicalization” and its exports in the form of “terrorism”, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said Saturday that Pakistan’s cross-border terrorism policy will “never succeed”, can have no expectation of impunity and “actions will certainly have consequences”. Prerequisites: — What is Terrorism?  What are the types of terrorism? — What is India’s counter-terrorism policy? —  Read about the   China-Pakistan Economic Corridor — Organisation to look for : UN General Assembly. Key takeaways:  — Speaking at the 79th UN General Assembly, Jaishankar said, “Terrorism is antithetical to everything that the world stands for. All its forms and manifestations must be resolutely opposed. The sanctioning of global terrorists by the United Nations should also not be impeded for political reasons.” — He also took on China on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and its debt-trap diplomacy when he said, “Unfair trade practices threaten jobs, just as unviable projects raise debt levels. Any connectivity that flouts sovereignty and territorial integrity acquires strategic connotations. Especially when it is not a shared endeavour.” — Jaishankar also flagged the challenges posed by Beijing’s economic strategy, as he said, “An important cause of many getting left behind has been the unfairness of the current globalization model. Over-concentration of production has hollowed out many economies, impacting their employment and social stability.” — “And, he underlined the need for reform of the UN. “The global order is inherently pluralistic and diverse. The UN began with 51 members; we are now 193. The world has changed profoundly and so have its concerns and opportunities. But to address both and indeed to strengthen the order itself, it is essential that the UN be the central platform for finding common ground. And that it certainly cannot be, by remaining anachronistic. Large parts of the world cannot be left behind when it comes to deciding the key issues of our times. An effective and efficient UN, a more representative UN and a UN fit for purpose in the contemporary era, is essential.” For Your Information:  — India’s counter-terrorism policy extends beyond its borders, emphasizing bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the fight against terrorism. India is not only a signatory of important UN conventions but also has entered into agreements with various countries to bolster its anti-terrorism efforts.  Points to Ponder:  — How has terrorism impacted India’s internal security and socio-economic stability? — What are the security challenges from Pakistan? — What initiatives have been taken by the government of India to counter-terrorism?  — What role does international cooperation play in India’s counter-terrorism strategy? — What reforms are required in UN? Post Read Question: Prelims  (3) In which of the following matters placed before the UN General Assembly, a resolution by a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting is required? 1. Admission of new members to the UN 2. Election of the non-permanent members of the Security Council 3.

The guidelines, formulated by experts from AIIMS, allow patients to make a considered decision on whether they want to go on life support and whether they want to be resuscitated. Prerequisites: — What is Euthanasia? What are the types of Euthanasia? — Active Euthanasia and Passive Euthanasia-compare and contrast — What is the Right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution of India? Key takeaways:  — It also allows withdrawal of supportive care like ventilation, dialysis, or ECMO when they have been declared brain dead, they are unlikely to benefit from advanced intervention, and the patient or their surrogate document an informed refusal of care. — The guidelines also make a mention of advance medical directive — a written declaration made by a person with decision-making capacity documenting how they would like to be medically treated or not treated should they lose capacity. ( Thought Process:  Talking about Passive Euthanasia in India, can you recall the Aruna Ramchandra Shanbaug v. Union of India (2011) case? What was the Supreme court’s verdict in Aruna Ramchandra Shanbaug v. Union of India (2011)? ) — Once the physician determines the inappropriateness of the life sustaining measures, it says, they will refer the case to the primary medical board. If the board reaches consensus then there will be another multidisciplinary meeting with family and a shared decision will be made. — For forgoing life sustaining treatments, the case will be referred to a secondary medical board, and the support would be withdrawn only after its nod. For Your Information: — Euthanasia, which comes from the Greek words meaning “a good death”, refers to the practice under which an individual intentionally ends their life. Euthanasia falls under the category of assisted dying.  — Euthanasia can be categorised as active or passive. Passive euthanasia is far more common and usually entails withholding lifesaving interventions with the consent of the patient or someone on their behalf. Active euthanasia is legal in only a handful of countries and necessitates deliberately using substances or forces to end the life of another person.     — The Supreme Court allowed passive euthanasia while recognising the living wills of terminally ill patients who could go into a permanent vegetative state, and issued guidelines regulating this procedure. Points to Ponder:  — What is the legal provision for euthanasia in India? — What are the arguments for euthanasia? — What are the ethical issues concerning euthanasia? —  How does passive euthanasia align with the Right to Life? Post Read Question: Evaluate the implications of passive euthanasia on medical ethics and patient rights.

What’s the ongoing story-  Arjun Sengupta writes— “Recently, researchers from IIT  Gandhinagar  uncovered fresh evidence that supports the existence of a dock in Lothal, one of the most important Harappan sites in India.” Prerequisites: — Read about the Indus Valley Civilisation — the Early Harappan Phase, the Mature Harappan Phase, and the Late Harappan Phase. — Know in detail about the Origin of the Indus Valley Civilisation, town planning, craft, and economy. —  Map work:  Major sites of Indus civilisation. Key takeaways:  — “Since  Lothal was first discovered in 1954 , archaeologists have debated whether the roughly 215-m long and 37-m wide structure, excavated at the township’s eastern edge, was a dockyard. ASI has always supported the dockyard thesis, but some scholars have argued that its size and inlet suggest more mundane usage. Here is the story of Lothal, and its “dock”.” — “The Lothal excavations were led by S R Rao, among the finest Indian archaeologists of his generation who discovered over 30 Harappan sites. It is he who identified the excavated Lothal structure as a dockyard.” — “Other evidence that Lothal served as a hub for maritime commerce came from the presence of seals — more than in any other site in Kathiawar/Saurashtra — that were likely used to seal documents or mark packages, discovery of various items that were likely traded, a warehouse, and what Rao referred to as stone anchors for ships.” — “But not everyone was convinced. In 1968, anthropologist Lawrence S Leshnik posited the “port” was actually a reservoir for drinking water and irrigating crops. He held that the dimensions of the inlet for ships to dock were inadequate to support the draught (hull) of seafaring vessels.” — “The IIT- Gandhinagar  study addresses some of these doubts. Today, the Sabarmati flows into the Gulf of Khambhat about 20 km from Lothal. The ASI has long believed that the river used to run much closer to the Harappan town at some point.” — “Satellite imagery used by IIT-Gandhinagar researchers has “unveiled the old channels of river Sabarmati”, which used to flow right next to Lothal. The river gradually shifted its course, leaving the ruins of Lothal’s dockyard with a seemingly odd orientation. The study found that via the Sabarmati, boats could have sailed to as far as Dholavira, another important Harappan site in the Rann of Kutch.” — “This, the study said, put Lothal at the heart of a bustling trade network that stretched from India all the way to ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq), where the earliest Bronze Age civilisation flourished.” — “Just like water brought Lothal prosperity as a commercial port, it also ushered in destruction. Lothal’s archaeological record indicates its settlements were rebuilt multiple times.” — “The decline, and eventual destruction of Lothal, occurred due to catastrophic flooding, and the Sabarmati changing course. As Rao noted in Lothal: A Harappan Port Town (1979), circa 2000 BCE, Lothal was submerged in a catastrophic flood — the acropolis was levelled and flood debris and silt destroyed buildings. Another flood destroyed the township for good circa 1900 BCE.” For Your Information: — Lothal, among southernmost Harappan sites, lies 80 km southwest of  Ahmedabad , at the head of the Gulf of Khambhat. In Gujarati, “Lothal” loosely translates to the “place of the dead” — a name given by villagers who knew of the existence of an ancient settlement (and remains of the long dead) much before the site’s official discovery. Points to Ponder:  — What are the characteristics of the Indus Valley civilisation? — What insights do we get about the economy, trade, and religion of the Indus Valley Civilisation from its artefacts and seals?  — What are the similarities and differences between the Indus Valley Civilisation and other contemporary civilisations? — What is the debate related to the decline of the Indus Valley civilisation? Post Read Question: (4) It was one of the southernmost sites of the Indus Valley civilisation. This port city is believed to have been built in 2,200 BC. It was a thriving trade centre in ancient times, with its trade of beads, gems and ornaments reaching West Asia and Africa. Archaeologist SR Rao led the team which discovered this place.  The above-mentioned lines refer to which of the following Harappan Sites? (a) Surkotada (b) Lothal (c) Dholavira (d) Banawali Other Important Articles Covering the same topic: Keepers of Lost Cities Who were the people of the Indus Valley Civilisation?   UPSC Syllabus: Preliminary Examination:  Economic and Social Development Mains Examination: GS-I, GS-III:  Indian Society and economy What’s the ongoing story-  According to a survey by global digital travel player  Booking.com , as many as 66 per cent of Indians who have taken a leisure trip over the past year and are planning another one use social media as a trove to draw travel ideas and inspiration from, be it from the Instagram feeds of family and friends or from content posted by celebrities and travel influencers on social media platforms. Prerequisites: — Read about social media and its regulation in India.  — What are the positive impacts of social media? — What is the status of the tourism sector in India? Key takeaways:  — With the explosion of social media and deep penetration of mobile internet and smartphones, the trend has evidently assumed a larger dimension globally as well as in India. In a way, screens allow us to first travel with our eyes. And it comes as no surprise that their influence over travel-related decisions is palpable. — The survey showed that 49 per cent of Indians are willing to travel to participate in an activity depicted on a show or movie, and 46 per cent seek accommodations that allow them to relive the experience of their favourite characters. For Your Information: — Today, social media has become an integral part of people’s lives in India, with the country having a rapidly growing user base. According to Global Statistics, Indians spend an average of 2.36 hours on social media daily. — India had approximately 821 million internet users and 462 million active social media accounts, representing an increase of 19 million internet users, or 2.6%, as per DataReportal and Kepios analysis. Points to Ponder:  — How has social media transformed the tourism industry in India and globally?  — What initiatives have been taken by the government of India to promote tourism in India? — How can social media be used for tourism promotion and management? — What are the environmental and cultural impacts of travel trends inspired by social media?

        "title": "Mike Johnson wins House speaker election after emerging as the Trump-backed 'GOP unity candidate' following 22 days of turmoil",
        "description": "",
        "text": "After 22 farcical days, thirteen failed candidates, four nominees and four floor votes, the Republicans have finally elected a House speaker. Louisiana 's Mike Johnson has been unanimously selected by his party to take the gavel in a vote that ended the three-week House GOP circus sparked by the ousting of Kevin McCarthy. Winning all 220 Republican votes on the floor, father-of-four Johnson, 51, cinched the top job after a battle dominated by backstabbing, death threats, side deals,  Donald Trump  and  Matt Gaetz . Johnson, who served as vice chair of the House  GOP  Conference and is backed by Trump, needed at least 215 out of 220 present Republicans to vote for him - but instead got unanimous consent from his party.  All 209 present  Democrats  voted for Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries in a vote dominated by jeers about election fraud and Trump. Johnson was the fourth Republican nominee for the top job in three weeks, and the first one to break through the GOP infighting. 'The People's House is back in business,' Johnson said following his election on the House floor to cheers throughout the chamber.              Johnson takes the speaker's gavel after his election to the Republican's top leadership position             After 22 farcical days, thirteen failed candidates, four nominees and four floor votes, the Republicans have finally elected a House speaker              Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy's name was finally taken down from over the door above the speaker's office             A new sign was installed above the speaker's office in the Capitol immediately after Johnson was elected               He was the first Republican speaker to get every single vote in his party since John Boehner in 2011, starkly contrasting the deep division each candidate has faced since McCarthy was voted out.  His victory will now allow the  House of Representatives  to conduct regular business again, which is desperately needed with less than a month until a potential government shutdown and as the Israel-Hamas war intensifies. 'I'll say this: we're going to dispense with all the usual ceremonies and celebrations that traditionally follow a new speakership because we have no time for either one. The American people's business is too urgent in this moment,' Johnson told reporters after his win.  'You're going to see Congress working as hard as it's ever worked and we're going to deliver for the American people. I'm grateful for this opportunity. I want to thank you for being patient with us,' he added.  The House will catapult back into legislative business that includes a resolution to support Israel and a contentious spending battle.  'This is a beautiful country,' Johnson said on the House floor immediately after his election, noting that the U.S. faces many challenges currently. 'We stand at a very dangerous time...A strong America is good for the entire world,' he said to applause from both the Democratic and Republican side of the chamber.  A faith-filled man, the new speaker mentioned how his wife prayed on her knees for weeks leading to his election.  He invoked God in his introductory speech as well. He referenced the 'In God We Trust' motto of the House of Representatives.  The Republican said the first course of action the House will take under his leadership is adopt a resolution condemning Hamas and in support of Israel. 'We have a catastrophe at our souther border,' he also added. 'The status quo is unacceptable and we must come together and address the broken border. We have to do it.' Johnson said there must be a reigning in of federal spending in order to bring down inflation.  'The greatest threat to our national security is our nation's debt,' he added.  'This speaker's office is going to be known for decentralizing the power here,' Johnson concluded.  He said he wants members more involved and influenced in all the processes of the House.  Trust, transparency and accountability will be pillars of how he will run the leadership office.  He was sworn into the office of the speaker by the Dean of the House Rep. Hal Rogers, R-K.Y. Immediately after his swearing in, the House took up the resolution in support of Israel as it faces attacks from Hamas terrorists.  President Joe Biden said that he has no issues with new Speaker Johnson on Wednesday during a press conference with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Former President Donald Trump - who publicly backed Johnson - cheered his election Wednesday.  'Congratulations to Rep. Mike Johnson. He will be a GREAT “SPEAKER.” MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!' he wrote on Truth Social.  Johnson was nominated on Tuesday evening - just hours after after Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., won an internal Republican vote but dropped out after 26 Republicans signaled they would not vote for him on the House floor. Majority Leader Steve Scalise, another Louisianan, was the first GOP nominee after  Kevin McCarthy  was ousted in a historic motion to vacate vote over three weeks ago.               House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries hands the gavel to speaker-elect Rep. Mike Johnson             Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy speaks with his successor, the new Speaker Mike Johnson  But he dropped out after about 24 hours when he realized there were holdouts who could not be swayed in his favor - those who thought he was too 'establishment.'  Then firebrand  Ohio  Republican Jim Jordan, chair of the powerful Judiciary Committee, won the nomination after Scalise, but was not able to sway about 20 moderates in his favor during three failed floor votes. Johnson and Jordan have highly similar voting records. Both voted against certifying the 2020 election, against the continuing resolution that keeps the government funded until November 17, against the $300 million Ukraine aid and for the McCarthy-Biden debt ceiling deal.  Rep. Madeleine Dean told DailyMail.com that a colleague told her the only difference between Johnson and Jordan is that 'one wears a jacket.'             GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik hugs Mike Johnson after nominating him for speaker on the House floor  As part of his 'fired up' brand, Jordan is infamously known around Capitol Hill to ditch his suit jacket, even when he's conducting business as the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.  Some Republican appropriators and defense hawks had opposed Jordan believing that he could cut defense spending.  'Jim Jordan has said everything is on the table to spending cuts, including defense,' one aide to a moderate member who opposed Jordan told DailyMail.com. 'Johnson has not gone that far.'  Jeffries sounded off about Johnson's nomination: 'The twice-impeached former president ordered House Republicans to stop Tom Emmer and elevate a top election denier. Is anyone surprised that they complied?'  Johnson led an amicus brief signed by more than 100 Republicans to a Texas lawsuit seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election.  Asked about his past efforts to overturn the results on Tuesday night, he huffed and told a reporter: 'next question.'  Meanwhile, Democrats seized on his involvement in 2020 election fraud claims. '[Johnson] has distinguished himself as being one of the primary antagonists to our democratic institutions and our free and fair elections,' Rep. Adam Schiff, R-Calif., told reporters.  Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., one of the eight who voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, told DailyMail.com: 'I believe Johnson is going to be trustworthy, more, will be honest, will be truthful.'  But Democrat Dean predicted Johnson would face the same 'untrustworthy' accusations that were levied against Kevin McCarthy.  'He's not somebody who's based in the truth he's very smooth talking. He's clearly bright, but he's not based on the facts and the truth,' she said.  Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said he didn't expect any major leadership or policy differences between Johnson and McCarthy, but Johnson was more trusted by the right wing of the party.  'I have been told by a number of my friends in the Freedom Caucus that they do expect they'll provide Mike Johnson more grace than they gave Kevin McCarthy. I think that's going to give him a little more runway to try to deal with the next three months, two months,' he said, referring to the upcoming spending battle to get the government funded.              429 members showed up to the vote that elected Mike Johnson as speaker              Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., looks on as the House holds Johnson's election              Rep. Lauren Boebert stands to vote for Johnson             Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez arrives for the Speaker vote, where she backed Democrat minority leader Hakeem Jeffries  'I believe that they trust Mike Johnson in a way that they didn't trust Kevin McCarthy.' McCarthy was ousted after he put a 'clean' continuing resolution, a bill to extend government funding at 2023 levels for six weeks while the House took more time to pass 12 single-subject spending bills, on the House floor.  The South Dakota Republican predicted that Johnson would be able to work across the aisle get negotiate spending deals despite his conservative voting record. He said when he came to office, 'Mike Johnson came to my office, sat down with me as a new member and talked to me about how important civility was in this place, how even when we disagree with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we should try to do it as as people who have good faith and good intention with decency.' 'That is not something very many members will spend time in these halls, preaching the importance of civility, but I bring that up, because that is at his heart who Mike Johnson is.'",

And what happened yesterday with the death of one of the leaders of Hamas is yet another factor that could push the conflict to escalate,\" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said during a news conference in Lisbon.  On Tuesday, a drone in the Lebanese capital of Beirut struck an apartment in the Shiite district of Beirut, killing Hamas' No. 2 political leader.     The apartment was a Hezbollah stronghold and Lebanese officials said Saleh Arouri, the founder of the  Hamas' military wing,  was killed, prompting worries of retaliation by Lebanon’s Hezbollah.     \n        \n       ISRAELI SPY MASTER VOWS TO TRACK DOWN EVERY HAMAS TERRORIST RESPONSIBLE FOR OCT 7: 'NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE'     The High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell, who answered questions regarding Ukraine and Israeli crisis, previously delivered a keynote speech at this year's Diplomatic Seminar, organized annually by the Foreign Ministry, as an opportunity to share experiences, taking into account the realities at the various posts in the Portuguese diplomatic network.

        "text": "An  Israeli  historian who was mobbed by pro-Palestine activists at an LSE Middle East lecture was targeted by a leaflet campaign in the days prior to the event. Benny Morris, 75, was heckled by students at the  London  School of Economics (LSE) just 15 minutes into his lecture about the Israeli-Palestinian crisis on Monday. The appearance of the radical Israeli historian, who was once jailed for refusing to do military service in the West Bank, sparked fury from students due to remarks he has made in the past, including referring to Palestinians as 'wild animals'. MailOnline can reveal he was targeted by a leaflet campaign in the days leading up to the lecture, with students calling for the event to be cancelled. Posters were put up online and around the university buildings with photos of the historian and controversial quotes from his books and interviews. One of the quotes featured in the posters is taken from a 2004 interview where he says 'there are circumstances in history that justify ethnic cleansing'.             An Israeli historian who was mobbed by pro-Palestine activists at an LSE Middle East lecture was targeted by a leaflet campaign in the days prior to the lecture             Posters were put up online and around the university buildings with photos of the historian and controversial quotes from his books and interviews             A 2004 interview taken from Haaretz magazine was also quoted in the posters at LSE             MailOnline can reveal he was targeted by a leaflet campaign in the days leading up to the lecture, with students calling for the event to be cancelled One leaflet included a quote from his 2009 book One State, Two States: Resolving the Israel/Palestine Conflict, which reads: 'Arabs, to put it simply, proportionately commit far more crimes, and commit far more lethal traffic violations than do Jews.' The full passage in the book reads: 'The value placed on human life and the rule of secular law is completely different, as exhibited in Israel itself in the vast hiatus between Jewish and Arab perpetration of crimes and lethal road traffic violations.  'Arabs, to put it simply, proportionately commit far more crimes, and commit far more lethal traffic violations than do Jews In large measure, this is a function of different human value systems, such as the respect accorded to human life and the rule of law.' Another leaflet shows the quote: 'The phenomenon of the mass Muslim penetration into the West and their settlement there is creating a dangerous internal threat,' taken from an interview in 2004. A 2004 interview taken from Haaretz magazine was also quoted. It reads: ') Advertisement \n   A male voice from the crowd is heard accusing him of being 'racist' to which he responds: 'I'd rather be a racist than a bore.'  Jeering can be heard as people cry out 'shame' and start chanting 'he'd rather be a racist than a bore'.  Other students were ejected from the lecture by the university's Dean Professor David Kershaw. An irate student who was asked to leave is recorded in one clip saying: 'You are violating the discrimination, harassment and bullying policy of this school. You are in violation. You are endangering your Palestinian students.  'By legitimising this and normalising it. This is not right. Apartheid off our campus.'  Mr Morris continued with his lecture, which overran its scheduled finish time of 8pm by 15 minutes.   Chants of 'free, free Palestine' can be  heard during the lecture, while outside a crowd of pro-Palestine students staged a protest as Mr Morris's talk is ongoing inside the building.   Drums are banged and a person leading the chant on a megaphone says: 'Apartheid off campus. Benny Morris off campus.'  The lecture on 'Rethinking 1949 and the Israeli Palestinian conflict' took place on Monday evening and was advertised on the LSE's website.  The university's students' union newspaper,  The Beaver , reported Prof Kershaw had responded to criticism about the event in an email sent to students in February. In it, it is claimed he spoke of having a 'balanced discussion on the current political conflict' and detailed a discussion he had with the Prime Minister of Jordan who encouraged him to 'create a space for everyone from all sides to speak'.  Mr Morris's previous guest attendance at LSE in 2011 was also met with protests on the streets of London by human rights activists.  A statement by Sarah Onifade, the Welfare and Liberation Sabbatical Officer at LSE, said: 'I want to express my strong disappointment about the upcoming event with Benny Morris by the LSE Law Department. Benny Morris has a history of making comments such as \"There are circumstances in history that justify ethnic cleansing…” and \"Something like a cage has to be built for them. I know that sounds terrible. It is really cruel. But there is no choice…” 'I believe comments like this have no place in our academic institution, or in any inclusive society. I firmly believe that his presence on campus will negatively impact all students and create a hostile environment that undermines our principles of diversity, equality, and mutual respect.  'Such inflammatory rhetoric not only goes against our values of inclusivity and tolerance, but it also undermines our efforts to foster a safe and supportive campus environment for all. 'While I respect and understand the desire for academic freedom, I feel that the event with Benny Morris is a greater threat to the wellbeing, and sense of belonging, for many students at LSE, and I believe all students should feel respected and valued within our community – no one should have to bear the burden of fear and hostility in their academic environment. 'I stand in solidarity with the students who are distressed at this event, and echo concerns of safety and wellbeing for all students on campus.  'Like many others, I want to categorically state that I do not endorse the presence of Benny Morris on campus. This being said, I do urge our community to be respectful and be mindful of students and staff who do wish to attend the event – their wellbeing and safety fundamentally need to be regarded.' MailOnline has contacted LSE for comment.             Mr Morris's lecture on 'Rethinking 1949 and the Israeli Palestinian conflict' was advertised on the LSE's website             Pro-Palestine protesters gathered outside of the building as Mr Morris spoke inside the building and chanted for him to get kicked off of campus             Mr Morris was jailed in the 1980s after refusing to serve in Israel's reserves against the first intifada as he disagreed with the country's policies (Pictured in 2008)             Thousands of people again marched in London yesterday to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza in a demonstration             Welsh singer-songwriter Charlotte Church (centre) joined the demonstrations in the capital on Saturday                           Activists staged a mass-sit down protest at London Liverpool Street station last October             Pro-Palestine protests have cost the Met Police £32.2 million so far as thousands more marchers are set to take to London streets this weekend. Pictured: Police officers during a Pro-Palestinian demonstration on January 6, 2024             As well as this hefty price tag, the force has announced that they have required 35,464 officer shifts, and more than 5,200 officer rest days to be cancelled in order to manage the disruptions. Pictured: A pro-Palestine march on October 28, 2023               In an interview with Fathom in 2015, Mr Morris somewhat backtracked on his comments he made more than a decade earlier to  Israeli news site Haaretz  in which he tried to justify ethnic cleansing of Palestine and called Israeli Arabs a 'time bomb'. Asked about his controversial work and if he would do anything differently, Mr Morris  told Israel online journal Fathom  he could have said things in 'a more temperate way' when he spoke with Haaretz in 2004.      \n   'Not that I have a problem with what I said, but there were one or two phrases which provided ammunition to hostile critics,' he said.  'But I don’t think I have changed anything I have ever written. I would take nothing back regarding my views about 1948 or the conflict, because what I wrote originally and what I continue to write is always based on persuasive evidence.' Mr Morris was jailed in the 1980s after refusing to serve in Israel's reserves against the first intifada as he disagreed with the country's policies.  He had fought in the 1967 Six-Day War and was later wounded near the Suez Canal.  Mr Morris called current Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a 'hateful, corrupt leader in an interview with the  Los Angeles Times  last year in which he spoke about the October 7 slaughtering of Jews by Hamas.  'When you have women raped and civilians taken hostage, it hardens Israeli hearts towards Palestinians,' he said.  'But it might also reopen the whole Palestinian question. For decades Israel basically said, \"We can  live with this small amount of terrorism and occasional shooting matches ,\" but now the Palestinian problem is back on the international agenda and that’s certainly a result of this attack by Hamas.' He said he favoured a two-state solution but 'my fear is that Palestinians still don’t want a two-state solution and believe Palestine is theirs and that the Jews came here illegally'. Today senior Tories expressed fresh fears that central London has become a 'no-go area' for Jewish people during pro-Palestinian protests in the capital.                           Michael Gove, the Levelling Up, Communities and Housing Secretary, is expected to produce a new official definition of 'extremism' within days             Lord Howard, the former Tory leader and ex-home secretary, warned it was 'unacceptable' that some Britons believe there are 'no-go areas' for them               It came as thousands of people again marched in London yesterday to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza in a demonstration organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. Such demonstrations have become a regular occurrence in the wake of the Hamas terror attacks on 7 October and Israel's bloody assault on Gaza in response.    \n   But there have been repeated claims of anti-Semitic abuse during the marches, with the Prime Minister having recently warned of an explosion of 'extremist disruption'. Rishi Sunak used a speech in Downing Street last week to pledge a new crackdown on a 'poison' being spread by Islamist and far-right groups. Michael Gove, the Levelling Up, Communities and Housing Secretary, is expected to produce a new official definition of 'extremism' within days. He claimed this would help 'good-hearted people' decide whether they should join marches, some of which he said had been 'organised by extremist organisations'. Lord Howard, the former Tory leader and ex-home secretary, today warned it was 'unacceptable' that some Britons believe there are 'no-go areas' for them. The Conservative peer, whose father was a Jewish Romanian immigrant who came to Britain in the 1930s, spoke on the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg show. Asked if he agreed that London was now sometimes a 'no-go area' for Jews, he replied: 'Yes, unfortunately that is true. This is an area where it's very difficult to get the balance right. 'The right to protest is undoubtedly a fundamental part of a free society and we must maintain the right to protest. But it's also unacceptable that sections of our community think our streets are no-go areas for them. 'So how you strike that balance, how you try and reconcile those two sometimes conflicting rights is a really, really difficult challenge. And I don't think we've quite got it right at the moment.'",

More than 350 faculty members at Harvard University wrote an open letter to the school’s leadership in response to a student statement that was \"nothing less than  condoning the mass murder \" of over a thousand Israelis, adding the administration's response \"fell short.\"         \n        \n       In the letter to Harvard President Claudine Gay, hundreds of Harvard faculty members said they were \"deeply concerned about the events in the Middle East, as well as the safety of our students here on campus.  \"The leaders of the major democratic countries united in saying that ‘the terrorist actions of Hamas have no justification, no legitimacy, and must be universally condemned’ and that Israel should be supported \"in its efforts to defend itself and its people against such atrocities.     \"In contrast, while terrorists were still killing Israelis in their homes, 35 Harvard student organizations wrote that they hold ‘the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence,’ with not a single word denouncing the horrific acts by Hamas.\"      \n        \n       GOP HARVARD GRADUATES SEND SCATHING LETTER BLASTING SCHOOL'S RESPONSE TO PRO-HAMAS STUDENTS: 'ABHORRENT'     People walk through the gate on Harvard Yard at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass.    (Getty Images)     That statement from the student groups was released the evening of Oct. 8, a day after the attacks that resulted in the  deadliest day for Jewish people  since the Holocaust. it said Hamas' killing, torture and kidnapping of Israelis \"did not occur in a vacuum.\" \"The apartheid regime is the only one to blame,\" the statement said, indicating the organizations believed Israel was responsible for the horrific attacks.      \n        \n       \"In the context of the unfolding events, this statement can be seen as nothing less than condoning the  mass murder of civilians  based only on their nationality,\" the faculty letter states. \"We’ve heard reports of even worse instances, with Harvard students celebrating the ‘victory’ or ‘resistance’ on social media.\" The faculty added it could have been a \"teaching moment and an opportunity to remind our students that beyond our political debates, some acts such as war crimes are simply wrong.\"     HARVARD PRESIDENT ADDRESSES BACKLASH FOLLOWING STUDENT GROUPS' STATEMENT BLAMING ISRAEL FOR VIOLENCE     An Israeli mobile artillery unit fired a shell from southern Israel toward the Gaza Strip in a position near the Israel-Gaza border Wednesday.

These are not easy times, and we pray for the safety of all our members and their families. The  Israeli-Palestinian conflict  has a long and complex history. We hold varying opinions, but none of us endorses all of Israel's past actions. \"However, the events of this week are not complicated.

So let me be clear. Our university rejects terrorism. That includes the  barbaric atrocities perpetrated by Hamas.  Our university rejects hate. \"Hate of Jews.  Hate of Muslims .

        "description": "",
        "text": "US  motorists can expect to see  gas prices  continue to fall in 2024 , according to a new forecast by GasBuddy. The fuel savings site is predicting the national average unleaded gas price will drop to $3.38 per gallon in the lead up to the  2024 presidential election , down from $3.51 in 2023. Prices could drop below $3 by the end of the winter, before rising again as the summer approaches, it said. In major cities, drivers are likely to see prices peak at around $4 a gallon in 2024. “As 2023 fades away, I’m hopeful those $5 and $6 prices for gasoline and diesel will also fade into memory,” GasBuddy’s head of petroleum analysis Patrick De Haan  said in a statement . Fuel costs were severely impacted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, when the average price per gallon hit $3.95, and briefly soared past $6 in California. Even with war still raging in Europe and concerns that the Israel-Hamas conflict could broaden, GasBuddy expects US consumers will save around $32bn on fuel costs in 2024 compared to 2023. Gas prices are tipped to fall again in 2024   ( Associated Press ) “These situations, as well as the fluid state of the global economy, fiscal policy by central banks to tame inflation, as well as potential interest rate cuts could alter the direction of the economy, shifting fundamentals in significant ways,” Mr De Haan said. The 2024 presidential election and the growing transition to electric vehicles will likely have an impact on prices at the pump, he said. The US increased oil production to a record 13.2 million barrels per day in November, which will help to offset any declines in exports by OPEC countries, GasBuddy said in a news release.  “Offsetting OPEC+’s production cuts is contributing to the rise of US oil production, which now stands at record levels,” Mr De Haan said.  “Combined with Canada, North American oil production could further stabilize countries that have decided to curb oil production.” While the declining gas prices will ease pressure on household finances, which have been battered by high inflation for the past two years, record-high domestic oil production stands at odds with the Biden administration’s stated goal of  reducing carbon emissions.",

        "title": "South Africa’s President Ramaphosa is reelected for second term after a dramatic late coalition deal",
        "text": "CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — South African President  Cyril Ramaphosa  was reelected by lawmakers for a second term on Friday, after his party struck a dramatic late coalition deal with a former political foe just hours before the vote. Ramaphosa, the leader of the  African National Congress , won convincingly in Parliament against a surprise candidate who was also nominated — Julius Malema of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters. Ramaphosa received 283 votes to Malema’s 44 in the 400-member house. The 71-year-old Ramaphosa secured his second term with the help of lawmakers from the country’s second biggest party, the Democratic Alliance, and some smaller parties. They backed him in the vote and got him over the finish line following the ANC’s loss of its long-held majority in a landmark election two weeks ago that reduced it to 159 seats in Parliament. \n     \n\n During a break in what turned out to be a marathon parliamentary session, the ANC signed the last-minute agreement with the DA, effectively ensuring Ramaphosa stays on as the leader of Africa’s most industrialized economy. The parties will now co-govern South Africa in its first national coalition where no party has a majority in Parliament. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n             \n                 \n                    RELATED COVERAGE\n                 \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Gunshots are heard near Chad’s presidential palace.

Keep track of the  latest AP elections coverage  from around the world here. \n    \n \n Ramaphose called the deal — which sent  South Africa into uncharted waters  — a “new birth, a new era for our country” and said it was time for parties “to overcome their differences and to work together.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n “This is what we shall do and this is what I am committed to achieve as the president,” he said. The ANC — the famed party of Nelson Mandela — had ruled South Africa with a comfortable majority since the end of  the apartheid system of white minority rule  in 1994.  \n     \n\n But it lost  its 30-year majority  in the humbling national election on May 29, a turning point for the country. The vote was held against the backdrop of widespread  discontent from South Africans  over high levels of poverty, inequality and unemployment. Analysts warn there might be complications ahead, though, given the starkly different ideologies of the ANC, a former liberation movement, and the centrist, business-friendly DA, which won 21% of the vote in the national election, the second largest share behind the ANC’s 40%. For one, the DA disagreed with the ANC government’s move to  accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza  in a highly sensitive case at the United Nations’ top court. The DA leader John Steenhuisen was the first to confirm the agreement.  “From today, the DA will co-govern the Republic of South Africa in a spirit of unity and collaboration,” he said as he stepped away from Friday’s proceedings for a speech carried live on television in which he said a deal was signed and that the DA lawmakers would vote for Ramaphosa for president. The Parliament session started at 10 a.m. in the unusual setting of a conference center near Cape Town’s waterfront, after the city’s historic  National Assembly building was gutted in a fire  in 2022. The house first went through the hourslong swearing-in of hundreds of new lawmakers and electing a speaker and a deputy speaker.  \n     \n\n The vote for president started late at night, with the results announced well after 10 p.m. Ramaphosa finished his acceptance speech as the clock ticked past midnight and into Saturday. Former President Jacob Zuma’s MK Party boycotted the session but that did not affect the voting as only a third of the house is needed for a quorum. ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula said the party was open to talking with anyone else who wanted to join the unity government. There are 18 political parties represented in Parliament and he said the multi-party agreement would “prioritize the country across the political and ideological divide.” Some parties, including Malema’s EFF, refused to join. The two other parties that joined the coalition deal were  the Inkatha Freedom Party  and the Patriotic Alliance, which has drawn attention partly because its leader, Gayton McKenzie, served a prison sentence for bank robbery. \n     \n\n McKenzie said he had been given a second chance in life and that South Africa also had one now, a chance to solve its deep socioeconomic problems. The ANC had faced a deadline to  strike a coalition agreement  as Parliament had to vote for the president within 14 days after election results were declared on June 2. The ANC had been trying to strike a coalition agreement for two weeks and  the final negotiations went on overnight  Thursday to Friday, party officials said.  South Africa has not faced  that level of political uncertainty  since the ANC swept to power in the 1994  first all-race election that ended  nearly a half-century of racial segregation. Since then, every South African leader has come from the ANC,  starting with Mandela . \n     \n\n The new unity government also harked back to the way Mandela, South Africa’s first Black president, invited political opponents to be part of a unity government in 1994 in an act of reconciliation when the ANC had a majority. Ramaphosa had played a key role in those negotiations as a young politician. This time, the ANC’s hand was forced. “The ANC has been very magnanimous in that they have accepted defeat and have said, ‘let’s talk,’” PA leader McKenzie said. ___ Magome reported from Johannesburg. ___ AP Africa news:  https://apnews.com/hub/africa",

        "text": "Mahmoud Abu Amir is among thousands of Palestinians frantically trying to locate their loved ones from afar F or Mahmoud Abu Amir, the war in his native Gaza began on Monday 9 October. An Israeli airstrike flattened a large area in the Jabalia refugee camp where he spent most of his life, demolishing the apartment block that was sheltering most of his family, including his wife, Mayar, and their two young children. Two days earlier, Hamas militants had stormed towns and kibbutzim near the  Gaza  Strip, killing 1,400 Israelis and taking at least 200 more hostage. When Abu Amir called his family that day to check on them, “it was a shock”, he said. “No one expected this to happen. But my wife, and my entire family were dead scared. They knew something would happen to them. They live near the border and they knew they would pay the price.” Abu Amir received news of the airstrike on 9 October while tending to the horses at a stable in northern Israel. He dropped to his knees, letting go of the horse he was holding. He sat on the ground and immediately began trying to call every member of his family back home. “I called my mother, my wife, everyone in the entire family, and there was no answer,” he said. In the days and weeks since, his daily video calls with his wife and children became voice calls due to the weak internet access in the territory, then frantic text messages. Now there is nothing at all. The thread of their communications frayed as the telecoms networks that cover Gaza dwindled to a minimum, amid fierce Israeli bombardments that have reportedly killed more than 7,700 people. The 32-year-old no longer knows if his wife and two children have survived. He knows that they fled to Khan Younis at the southern end of the strip the week after the strike on their building, but since then communication has been almost impossible. On 9 October there were also Israeli  strikes on offices and infrastructure for Gaza’s main telephone companies , Jawwal and Paltel. On Friday, Jawwal announced “a complete cessation of all communications and internet services within the Gaza Strip in light of the ongoing aggression”. The internet monitoring organisation NetBlocks said internet services in the territory  showed  a “collapse in connectivity”. “I don’t know if they are alive or dead, under the rubble calling for help, or dead. I have no information at all,” said Abu Amir. “Between last Thursday night until now I have no news of my wife and children. Until now, every time I try to call, all I hear is a message saying the number I’ve called is out of service. Israel cut the connection with Gaza; now I am having a nervous breakdown. The rest of my family is in northern Gaza, where the bombing is.” Abu Amir followed news of the assault on his home from 50 miles away in the West Bank city of Ramallah, a short distance separated by a web of border crossings, checkpoints and barriers that he has been unable to cross for five years. He has never met his young son, who was born a week after he left for medical treatment in Jerusalem five years ago. Now he is among the thousands of other workers and people from Gaza who sought medical treatment in Jerusalem or the West Bank who have been trapped there since the 7 October, unable to return and frantic as they try to check on their families. Some of the 17,000 who obtained work permits for Israel have remained, sheltering outside a sports hall in Ramallah. Elsewhere, others like Abu Amir can only watch as the place they grew up, home to 2.3 million people, is destroyed. It took rescue workers four hours to save his children from underneath the destroyed remains of their apartment in the early October airstrike. When Abu Amir called his mother, he heard only screaming down the phone line. After hours of searching, including calling every local hospital, his daughter was found trapped under a sofa that had wedged itself between the floor and the wall, protecting her from the falling debris. The family fled south, hoping for safety. “The difference between Gaza and life here in Ramallah is the difference between the earth and the sky,” said Abu Amir, conflicted that he is safe from the bombardments while unable to save his family. He tried frantically calling the Red Cross or other aid organisations that might be able to locate his wife and children, without success. He knew they were sleeping outside a school run by the UN in the southern city of Khan Younis, but there were reports of a bombing nearby and they were already without food or water. “Until now, there’s been no connection to the networks – I can’t reach them,” he said. “I am terrified.”",

        "text": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Protesters packed up their belongings and left a pro-Palestinian encampment at Drexel University on Thursday after the school announced a decision to have police clear the encampment. University President John Fry said in a statement that he decided to have campus police and public safety officers join Philadelphia police in  clearing the encampment  as peacefully as possible. News outlets reported that police gave protesters a warning to clear the encampment and the protesters left. Fry said the university is committed to protecting the community members’ right to assemble peacefully and express their views, but he has the responsibility and authority to regulate campus gatherings to ensure safety and fulfill the mission to educate students.  “An unauthorized encampment that involves large numbers of people unaffiliated with Drexel trespassing on our campus is illegal,” Fry said. “The language and chants coming from this demonstration, underscored by protestors’ repugnant ‘demands,’ must now come to an end.” \n     \n\n Protesters gathered their belongings as dozens of officers on bicycles arrived around 5:20 a.m..

Fry said Tuesday that classes would be held virtually for a third day on Wednesday after administrators tried to open a line of communication to the protesters but were rebuffed. News outlets reported that the university announced Wednesday night that the campus was returning to normal operations Thursday. In his statement early Thursday, Fry said previous requests for protesters to disperse had been ignored, but he was asking Drexel affiliates to leave the encampment so police could “escort any remaining trespassers off our campus.” A wave of pro-Palestinian tent encampments on campuses has led to  over 3,000 arrests  nationwide. Harvard University  held its commencement  Thursday following a weekslong pro-Palestinian encampment. Hundreds of students in graduation robes walked out chanting “Free, Free Palestine” a day after the school announced that 13 Harvard students who participated in a protest encampment would not be able to receive diplomas alongside their classmates. \n     \n\n Also Thursday, the leaders of Northwestern University and Rutgers University  testified before the House  Education and Workforce Committee where they defended their decisions to end pro-Palestinian encampments through negotiations rather than police force. The school leaders told committee members that they were able to defuse any danger without ceding ground to protesters.  Northwestern President Michael Schill and Jonathan Holloway of Rutgers were called before the committee as part of a series of Republican-led hearings examining how colleges have responded to allegations of antisemitism. Also testifying was Gene Block, chancellor of the  University of California, Los Angeles , which has come under scrutiny for a delayed police response to violence between pro-Palestinian protesters and counterprotesters. A new pro-Palestinian encampment appeared on the UCLA campus as Bock testified Thursday. The encampment was abandoned when law enforcement arrived midday and declared it an unlawful assembly. A small group of demonstrators later staged a sit-in inside a nearby building before officers cleared them out.",

        "text": "Darwish, one of the ‘foremost contemporary Arab poets’, discusses the Israeli strikes on Gaza, art and the role of poetry in times of war W hen the Palestinian writer and professor Refaat Alareer was  killed  last month in an Israeli strike, the world mourned. Alareer was a beloved figure in the Palestinian literary community who encouraged young people in Gaza to write and express themselves in English. His poem If I Must Die, which includes lines like “If I must die / let it bring hope / let it be a tale”,  resonated  with readers across the globe. In the days after Alareer’s death, I reached out to the acclaimed Palestinian poet Najwan Darwish to hear his thoughts on the role of poetry in times of war. The New York Review of Books describes Darwish as one of the “foremost contemporary Arab poets”, and his work has been translated into more than 20 languages. His most recent book, Exhausted on the Cross, which was translated into English   by Kareem James Abu-Zeid, won the 2022 Sarah Maguire prize for poetry in translation . Darwish is from Jerusalem, and his spare, elegant poems address concepts of homeland, of loss and belonging: “I want eternity at the breakfast table / with the bread and oil. / I want  you – / earth, / my defeated banner.” At times, they sparkle with irony and humor. Historical figures like the Persian poet Hafez float in and out of his pages like he’s in conversation with old friends. “Poetry has been the colossal record of violence and … the colossal record of compassion,” the Chilean poet Raúl Zurita wrote in the foreword to Exhausted on the Cross, and it’s a duty that the poet takes seriously. Darwish (no relation to the famous Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish) and I spoke by phone about the Israeli strikes on Gaza, art and retaining one’s humanity in the face of atrocities. How did you learn about Dr   Refaat Alareer ’s death? I had known of Refaat for a while through his writing and his YouTube videos: lessons in English literature for his students in Gaza. He was an influential voice. I had been following his recent videos, where he spoke about being targeted by the Israelis. They bombed his home, and he survived, but then they bombed his sister’s home where he was staying, killing him and her and her children and other members of his family. It is hard to find words to describe this. There have been [dozens of]  writers  and  journalists  in Gaza who have been killed by the Israelis at this point. Some of them I know through their work, and some are friends. There’s a poet,  Saleem al-Naffar , who I first met in Edinburgh where we read poetry together, maybe 20 years ago. He was a wonderful, good man and very funny. I heard recently that he was killed with his wife and his two daughters and his son and other members of his family. One of the worst things is that there’s no one from the family to even call and try to reach, to send condolences or even speak to about it. His whole family has been erased. That’s horrifying, the idea that your entire family could be wiped out. It’s true. There are also other, secondary things we are losing as well. We didn’t just lose Alareer, but we lost his poetry; it’s all underneath the rubble, all the future poetry he would have written. And all these artists who have been killed … what’s happened to their art? We talk about numbers of people dead, and we can’t even begin to comprehend this other loss. If I must die, let it be a tale.  #FreePalestine   #Gaza   pic.twitter.com/ODPx3TiH1a Are Palestinian artists and writers in particular being targeted? No, it’s not just journalists or writers or artists. Words, speech – that’s what’s being targeted. Israel could target you for just posting something on social media [as has been documented in Israel and the West Bank since 7 October]. In the past, Israel dressed up their approach with makeup, so to speak – they wanted things to look good, have a good appearance, commit these crimes against Palestinians in a sort of proper way. Now, they have a green light from the United States government and from European democratic governments. They can kill as many people as they want. It makes you see the hypocrisy of these western democracies that speak of a commitment to human rights. Look at America’s [response], look at the UK. Also, to be clear, I don’t see the Israeli regime as representative of the Jewish people. We should always differentiate between the Israeli colonial regime and the Jewish people of the world. It annoys me when I see [Benjamin] Netanyahu speaking in their name, like he’s representing them or cares about them. Obviously, he does not. One question that’s on my mind and probably other people’s minds as well, is, how do we retain our humanity when everything is collapsing around us? As an artist, do you have an answer? To be honest with you, I don’t have an answer. Before October 7, I used to have certain, more solid thoughts and beliefs. And after that, things changed; I feel like I’ve lost my ability to feel. I see things, I see atrocities, but I don’t feel them. I know that with time, the feelings will come back and I’ll be able to recognize what’s happening. For more than 70 days, every day, several times a day, I’ve been seeing videos and images of murdered and wounded children, in bombed hospitals, under the rubble, etc. I can’t stop thinking about them. I’ve started searching on social media, trying to find out what’s happened to them, their stories, their names. So, it’s a hellish moment. When you are in such a hellish moment, your thoughts about art and the role of art or poetry or writing can’t remain the same. There was a moment at the beginning of the genocide when I thought I would never write again. Usually I write on paper, and I carry a notebook with me wherever I go. I write poems in it as an everyday practice – like a diary. When I finish the pages of a notebook, I edit it and it becomes a poetry collection, a book. I realized early in life that the only thing I care about among my little belongings is my notebooks. I don’t care about any other belongings. When I travel, I carry them with me. I was invited to attend the Festival de Literatura de Bogotá in Colombia in November as a special guest. It was planned before the 7th of October events. I felt obligated to go, like it was a kind of duty; I felt like I had to do something. I was not in good condition to travel. I was emotionally not well; I was lost, and it’s a very long journey. In the Amsterdam airport, I was stopped for an extra check – the usual racist procedure. They were not very kind, as you can imagine. I hadn’t slept much. And when I finally got on the plane, I realized I had lost my notebook. This was full of poems for my next book; I had written many things about the October war, all about the kids in Gaza. I thought, it’s done. I didn’t write anything for a while. I felt it was a kind of sign; this, happening along with the genocide that’s taking place. And then what happened? I got another notebook, and slowly, I started writing in it. I was trying to remember, but I remembered very few poems. And in this process of remembering, comes pain, because I remember things which I can’t write again. Since early November, I’ve been in this process of trying to remember so I can rewrite at least some lines, and also trying to forget about it so I can live my life again. It’s a metaphor for our lives as well, because even if [Palestinians] want to continue as a nation, as a people, we have to remember, but we also have to forget. And I don’t know what we should remember and what we should forget. People are acting brave and strong in front of the media every day. But Israel has caused enormous damage to our lives. There have been eight decades of suffering, if not a full century, because of this colonial project. It’s like living your entire life in a nightmare. You’ve talked about the role of the poet as a historian in past interviews. Can you tell me what that means? I think of writing as a testimony for history. If one day in the future someone reads my poetry, I think, or I hope, they will be able to tell who is the colonizer, and who are the people of the land. Literature can sometimes reflect this better than any political speech. It’s difficult for me to talk about the role of artists, or writers, in a genocide. Maybe you are relatively safe for a moment, but you are not. No one is safe. I read in the news about the so-called “conflict”. I don’t agree with the term, conflict. In Palestine, we don’t have conflict, we have settler colonialism. Israel is a settler colonialism project. It’s not a fight between two nations or two neighbors as it has been portrayed in the media. Are you reading anything that’s bringing you solace during this time? I have been most affected by the messages of the children in Gaza. They have broken me, and also bring me solace. One of the most astonishing things happened. There was a video of a young girl, her name is Dareen Albayaa. She and her brother were the only survivors from her family in Gaza, though she told the journalist that she has an uncle in Turkey. The journalist asked her: “What do you want to tell the people who are listening to you, what would you like them to do for you?” The girl  said : “If they love me, let them write to me.” I was shocked. Why would this girl want someone to write to her? What is it about writing, in this context? Why is it so important? It gave me this sense that writing is a way to confront history, or a way to face the injustices that are happening. So, the messages of the children are the most motivating things, and also the most painful as well, right? I wish I could take their pain away and carry it myself. When you are an audience to a genocide and you can’t even contribute something – I feel that it is worse in some ways. People have different reactions. Some stop watching the news. Some stop feeling anything about it and do nothing about it. For me, this doesn’t work. Of course, as a writer, if you do not really care about the fate of other humans or the injustices of the world, I question what kind of writer you really are. It’s a good question, because so much of writing involves empathy. Many of your poems touch on the subject of occupation, and rather than mythologize people or make them out to be victims, your characters feel real and possess a kind of quiet dignity. Yes, and I think it’s very representative of the Palestinian people; this is the people’s contribution to my writing. I’ve watched it all my life, since I was a child, and even now – I’m watching people struggling to keep their dignity as much as possible. Human dignity should be guaranteed for everyone, everywhere. This should be an unquestioned right. But the systems in which we live, like capitalism, eliminate human dignity. Your poems often take up heavy subjects, like colonialism and the horrors of war. But you also write about the beautiful, even mundane parts of life. How do you not get lost in the bleakness of it all? Despite everything, I should say that I see a lot of beauty. I am not a person who likes to praise their homeland. But Palestine contains a lot of beauty, in its nature, culture, people. I also read a lot; reading is a sort of cure. It connects you with other humans and their past. The library is the archive of the human soul. Art is a big part of this too; it frees you from the limitations and cruelties of the moment. There’s also poetry as well, of course. I don’t think of my poetry as activism. I do that outside of it. Poetry is like praying. You can’t do activism inside a prayer. It’s more of a spiritual practice. Of course, these things only work when the situation is more normal – not like the way things are now. One of the real struggles during these times is not to lose your mind, because one of the goals of any oppressive system, like colonialism, is to make the oppressed crazy. It’s a system of control. If they succeed, then no one will listen to you when you start shouting. I’ve seen this happen to people around me, so I became a little obsessed with it. When I endure atrocities or witness them, I question myself, and remember this, and it pulls me back to sanity. I have a lot of work to complete. I’m trying to finish my notebooks, to make digital copies of them or to give them to my friends; to prepare myself for whatever comes next. In terms of new work, I have several books coming out. One is an English translation from Yale University Press in 2024; a selection of poetry from the past 10 years. In terms of my other poetry, in Arabic – I’m just trying to finalize some things, as no one knows what the future holds. It must be difficult to continue working, to be a working writer right now. I wish I could stop writing, sometimes. It’s an unusual life. I wake up from bed with strange things in my head and live in the past too much and feel the future too much. When you brought up the issue of a poet being a kind of historian, it’s true: I’m worried about history. I continue to revisit it. I wrote a poem about Armenian history; nowadays, I see that we Palestinians are living out something like that once again. So here, you see the ironies of history; history mocks us. It shows us that the things we thought people suffered in the past – they’re still in front of you. It says, you think you are writing about the past; you’re really writing about your future. In a way, though, history helps you see that everything and everyone is connected. What happened to the Palestinians, also happened to the Maori people. One of the most precious things I have received recently were messages from Maori people, the original people of the so-called New Zealand, who translated a selection of my work into Maori, and published it in honor of a day of solidarity with Palestinians. We humans still don’t seem to understand that we’re all connected. Everyone is a “foreigner” at some time or another. At any moment, any of us can again become a foreigner and a refugee.

        "description": "",
        "text": "A mother who was slaughtered by terrorists in Israel alongside her husband and three children sent a final WhatsApp message to her Australian friends to say her family was safe. Tamar Kedem-Siman Tov texted her  Sydney  friends, Yishai and Mor Lacob, from the concrete bunker of her home in Nir Oz kibbutz, in southern Israel, at about 2.45pm on Saturday. The message read: 'Hi guys, we got into the shelter in our house, we're all going okay.' An hour later, she stopped responding to calls and texts. The Lacobs started to panic and tried contacting everyone they knew in the village to find out what was going on, before they received the heartbreaking news that the Tov's safe room had been raided by militants.  Tamar, her husband Johnny, their six-year-old daughters Shachar and Arbel, and their two-year-old son Omer had been  murdered  by  Hamas -linked terrorists.             Tamar Kedem-Siman Tov with her husband Johnny and their six-year-old daughters Shachar and Arbel, and their two-year-old son Omer. They were murdered on Saturday             A mock-up of the final WhatsApp message Tamar Kedem-Siman Tov sent her friends in Sydney 'Our hearts are shattered,' Yishai wrote on Facebook on Monday. 'An entire family was killed by evil murderers who shot the children and parents  simply because they were Jewish . 'And this is just one story, among so many. It's unbearable.' Nir Oz is a farming village with a population of about 400 and is 3km from Gaza. Despite its proximity to a conflict zone, Mor told the  Sydney Morning Herald  it was considered a peaceful place to live and raise a family. 'They wouldn't have thought such a thing can happen,' she said.  Tamar was a social activist who had been campaigning to become the head of Eshkol Regional Council, in Israel's southern district. 'She was such a special woman,' Mor told the publication. 'She always cared about the poor people, always made sure that people less fortunate will have the same opportunities.             The family were hiding in a concrete bunker at their home in southern Israel, before it was breached. Tamar (left) uploaded this photo four days ago                         Friends flooded Facebook with tributes to the young family (pictured)               'She was a living example to these values.' Just four days ago, the mother-of-three had been posting photos of her council campaign on Facebook. 'Half-week summary post, because even Facebook can't keep up with me this holiday,' she wrote on Thursday, in a post translated from Hebrew to English. 'The area speaks for itself - we want an attentive head of the council, who sees the residents - from young to old.' She aimed to improve health, employment, safety and security across the region. Her posts were flooded with messages of support on Thursday. By Tuesday, they were overcome with tributes. 'My heart is torn,' one person wrote.  Another said: 'What a tragedy... Can't believe that we are four days later.'             Pictured: Tamar and her husband Johnny, who were living in southern Israel when their village was attacked The attacks began about 6.30am Israeli time on Saturday when thousands of Hamas rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel and as far as Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.  \n   At the same time, hundreds of Palestinian militants paraglided across the heavily guarded frontier, while others stormed towns by boat or after blasting holes in the Gaza–Israel barrier. They then went door to door gunning down innocent civilians and soldiers before kidnapping more then 100 Israelis and taking them into Gaza. In response, the Israeli army said on Monday that it hit more than 500 targets in the Gaza Strip in overnight retaliatory strikes on the impoverished and blockaded Gaza Strip, an enclave of 2.3million people.  Officials there reported at least 413 Palestinian deaths. In Australia,  pro-Palestinian protestors were allowed to chant 'gas the Jews'  and burn the Star of David in front of Sydney's Opera House on Monday night. Counter-demonstrators were arrested for attempting to fly the Israeli flag at the protest site.  Police are now under fire for allowing the protest to go ahead  - while telling Jewish Australians to 'stay home' for their own safety. The rally, organised by the Palestine Action Group Sydney, saw vast numbers of pro-Palestine activists gather at Town Hall in Sydney's CBD before marching to the Opera House. Chaotic scenes ensued when the demonstration was hijacked by radical Muslims - some wearing black masks - who threw lit flares at police and chanted 'f*** Israel' and 'f*** the Jews' beneath the steps of the iconic harbouside venue.             Pictured: Chaotic scenes at the Sydney Opera House, as a demonstration was highjacked pro-Palestinian protesters - some wearing black masks - who chanted 'f*** Israel' and 'f*** the Jews' At one point, there were even chants of 'gas the Jews'. A large crowd of men attempted to set light to an Israeli flag with firecrackers before stamping on it and tearing it to shreds. Cries of 'Allahu Akbar' ('God is great' in Arabic) and 'death to the Jews' rang out as some members of the crowd swarmed towards the police barrier, brandishing torn pieces of the Israeli flag - despite the rally organisers calling for protesters to respect the police. More than 100 cops formed a ring of steel along the steps of the Opera House and didn't intervene when flares or other projectiles were thrown at them. NSW Premier Chris Minns said he 'deplored' the rally and described it as being 'against the tenets of our multicultural community'. 'We lit up the Opera House in support of innocent people who have had their lives slaughtered or loved ones kidnapped,' Mr Minns told Sunrise. 'The community expectation from the vast majority of people I have spoken to in the past 48 hours has been horror at the actions of Hamas and also the demonstrations that have taken place in Sydney in the past 48 hours.' Earlier, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called on pro-Palestinian protesters to abandon the rally.             Israel supporters kept their distance, watching the display from the other side of Circular Quay",

        "title": "Primary apathy in Michigan: Democrats, GOP struggle as supporters mull whether to even vote",
        "description": "Primary apathy in Michigan: Democrats, GOP struggle as supporters mull whether to even vote",
        "text": "LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Rev. Steve Bland Jr. remembers the massive get-out-the-vote effort he helped mobilize four years ago, when pastors and community leaders spread out across Detroit neighborhoods, made phone calls and worked around the clock to encourage people to vote.                  HT Image         He's not seeing that kind of enthusiasm this time around.       Madeleine Byrne, a 25-year-old from Bloomfield Hills in Oakland County, a wealthy suburban enclave that proved pivotal in Michigan's swing back toward Democrats in recent years, said she likes how former President Donald Trump has “put America first” but has misgivings about supporting him in 2024.   “I think he causes fights where they aren't necessary,” she said.   In Michigan, a state that both major parties say they must have to win the White House in 2024, a cloud of apathy has settled over the electorate. Even with crucial races for the  U.S. Senate  and Congress also on the ballot, genuine enthusiasm is hard to find. The state's voters are  poised to cast  ballots in their respective  primaries on Tuesday , but the prospect looms that they will be left with the same choices for president in November that they considered four years ago.    That means the biggest task for candidates may be inspiring Michigan voters to care.   “A good quarter of the people I talk to aren’t sure if they’ll vote at all,” said  Lori Goldman , who founded a group called “Fems for Dems” to help drive up voter turnout for Biden in Oakland County four years ago. “A lot of people are just like, ‘I’m not voting. I’m not doing it.'\"   Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said Monday that over 1 million people had already cast their primary ballots, taking advantage of new voting laws that allow for nine days of early, in-person voting. A total of 2.3 million people — or 30% of registered voters — participated in the 2020 primary.   The early vote totals may include a number of “uncommitted” ballots from  Democrats unhappy  with Biden's support for Israel in its response to the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib has urged voters to mark their  ballots that way  on Tuesday to send a message to Biden and other Democrats.    Among Republicans, Trump's rallies draw enthusiastic crowds, and he has racked up decisive wins so far in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina and the U.S. Virgin Islands. But it remains unclear whether his  support extends beyond  the core of true believers who have helped him maintain his grip on the GOP. Surveys by  AP VoteCast  have shown that  some Republicans , especially college-educated and moderate voters, have misgivings about the former president.    For voters such as Byrne, in politically competitive areas like Oakland County, the unease sometimes takes the form of Trump fatigue. Asked how she feels about the choice that's looming in this year's presidential contest, Byrne wrinkles her face.   “Honestly, I’ve been thinking about whether I want to vote at all.\"   “We as Americans have this great privilege and, as a woman, I’m aware we’ve had it for only 100 years,\" she said. \"But given our circumstances, with the choices that we do have, I think it’s difficult to actually make a choice. And so, I wonder if I will.”   In 2020, voter turnout surged by 14% compared to the previous election, eclipsing the record set in 2008 for the highest number of votes cast in Michigan. The trend continued in 2022 when the state registered its highest midterm election turnout ever.    Young Michigan voters have stepped up in recent years. In 2022, Michigan saw the highest youth voter turnout rate nationwide at 36.5%, surpassing the estimated national youth turnout of 23% by over 13 percentage points, according to CIRCLE, the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University.   But the excitement that led to hours-long lines on college campuses across Michigan appears to have died down.    “You’re hearing people say that maybe they’re going to stay out of the election or they don’t know who you’re going to vote for,\" said Vrunda Patel, a junior at the University of Michigan.   Patel and fellow University of Michigan Democrats met with California Rep. Sara Jacobs, part of a wave of recent Biden surrogates sent in to drum up enthusiasm, at an Ann Arbor coffee shop to strategize for the upcoming election. The discussion mainly revolved around motivating college students to vote, with one student saying bluntly: “No one I talk to is excited to vote for Joe Biden this election.”   Jacobs offered reassurance.   “It’s a long way away from the election,” she said. “With the 2012 Obama campaign, this far out, Obama’s poll numbers were bad. People were not that excited. This is a normal progression in a reelection.”   Several students mentioned the idea of “uncommitted” votes in the Tuesday primary. Double-digit numbers could spell trouble for Biden in the general election.   “I'd rather the president be hearing how people feel now rather than in October,” said Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell, who has spoken with the president about his difficulties in Michigan.   Biden’s campaign is acutely aware of its enthusiasm problem. Several top surrogates, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, have trekked to Michigan this month. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a co-chair of his reelection campaign, is already holding get-out-the-vote events.   Whitmer, who won reelection by almost 11% in 2022, has publicly and privately pushed the president to lean into his effort to defend abortion rights. Her own campaign  benefited directly  from a voter-led ballot proposal enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution.    Trump  appears  to have the luxury of looking to November. His supporters lined up for nearly a mile to hear him speak at an  Oakland County event  this month, and the rules of the GOP primary are tilted heavily in his favor.   “If we win Michigan, we win the election,” Trump told the enthusiastic crowd.   But Trump's loyal core has not translated into wins in recent years. After winning the state by only 11,000 votes in 2016, he lost it by nearly 154,000 votes just four years later. In the 2022 midterms, all  three of the statewide  Republican candidates he endorsed were crushed by Democratic incumbents.   Michigan’s Republican Party may not be in position to help much in the fall.  Dueling pro-Trump  factions are now claiming to run the state party ahead of a March 2 presidential nominating convention during which 39 of the state’s 55 delegates will be awarded.   Trump, meanwhile, is trying to broaden his appeal to voters disillusioned with Biden and the Democrats. His campaign points to Biden’s  faltering poll numbers with Black adults  and what he characterizes as advantages on issues like immigration and the economy, He traveled to Michigan last year to  court autoworkers , although the United Auto Workers union recently gave its endorsement to Biden.   Recent AP polling  has shown that more U.S. adults are feeling slightly better about the economy, but so far those numbers have not translated into higher approval ratings for the president. If that disconnect persists, it could pose a challenge in places like Michigan.   Nearly 78% of Detroit’s population is Black, and the city has long been a Democratic stronghold. That isn't likely to change, and yet frustration is running high among Black voters there. Few people expect to see the long lines of people who waited patiently in 2008 and 2012 to cast their ballots for Barack Obama, or even four years ago for Biden, his former vice president.    The current lack of enthusiasm won’t stop the Rev. Bland from once again working with pastors across Detroit to encourage voting. Bland got attention in 2020 with his statement that the Black community had gone from “from picking cotton to picking presidents,” and he remains steadfast in his determination to replicate that success.   “Apathy always is high when information is low,\" he said. “So if we have informed people and we spend time talking, informing them about what's at stake, then I think that’s what will bring the energy.”   ___   Associated Press writers Corey Williams and Tom Beaumont contributed to this report.",

Ashkelon is in central Israel just north of the Gaza Strip.\n     \n            The US has renewed its request for consular access to Borak Alagha, 18, and Hashem Alagha, 20, who were born and raised in Chicago in their early childhood, the official said, adding that their location has been shared with their family.\n     \n            The brothers were “arrested for collaboration with Hamas,” Israel’s Consul General to the Midwest, Yinam Cohen, told CNN on Thursday.\n     \n            On Friday an Israeli official told CNN that the brothers are suspected of assisting senior Hamas officials during the war and were detained for questioning.\n     \n            When asked for comment, the IDF told CNN the brothers are not in their custody, referring questions to the Israeli Security Agency (ISA).\n     \n            A lawyer for the family rejected the Israeli accusations, calling them “baseless accusations and smears.”\n     \n            “These unverified claims, which have zero evidence, are nothing but a flimsy attempt by Israel to avoid accountability for unjustly and arbitrarily detaining two US citizens,” said Maria Kari, an immigration attorney who is representing the family, in a statement to CNN.\n     \n            “For months, Hashem and Borak’s family members have been pleading with elected officials in the US to protect the boys — both American citizens born and raised in Chicago — from Israel’s attacks on Gaza,” Kari said.\n     \n            As CNN previously reported, the brothers were among a group of roughly 20 men detained by IDF soldiers early on February 8, according to the brothers’ cousin Yasmeen Elagha.\n     \n            She said she spoke by phone with Hashem’s mother – her aunt – who was present during the incident and claimed IDF broke through the door while the group was sleeping, tied up the women and children inside the home, and took all the men into custody. Elagha said the home belongs to her uncle and her family has no ties to Hamas. IDF did not respond to CNN’s request for comment at the time on the matter.\n     \n             This story has been updated with additional details. \n     \n             CNN’s Richard Allen Greene contributed reporting.",

        "text": "Houthis' spokesperson said that US strikes on Yemen had no significant impact on its capabilities. Houthis will continue to prevent Israel-affiliated vessels from passing through the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, Mohammed Abdulsalam told news agency Reuters following the latest strike on a military base in Sanaa. Another Yemen's Houthi group Ansarullah's official told Al Jazeera that there were no injuries in the strike and the group has vowed a \"strong and effective\" response. \"There were no injuries, no material nor human losses,\" Nasruldeen Amer said as per Al Jazeera.

In the latest strike, the US targeted a radar site, a day after dozens of American and British strikes on the Iran-backed group's facilities. The guided missile destroyer Carney used Tomahawk missiles \"to degrade the Houthis' ability to attack maritime vessels, including commercial vessels,\" the US Central Command said.  The Houthis' television channel Al-Masirah reported that the United States and Britain were targeting the Yemeni capital Sanaa with raids amid concerns intensified about a widening regional conflict in the region. Houthis swore retaliation as Joe Biden warned that he could order more strikes if they do not stop their attacks on merchant and military vessels in the Red Sea.  Joe Biden said, “We will make sure that we respond to the Houthis if they continue this outrageous behavior.” Explosions were confirmed at military bases near airports in the capital Sanaa and Yemen's third city Taiz. White House spokesperson John Kirby said the initial strikes had targeted the Houthis' ability to store, launch and guide missiles or drones while the Pentagon said that the assault reduced the Houthis' capacity to launch fresh attacks.  Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a member of the Houthi Supreme Political Council said as per Reuters, “Your strikes on Yemen are terrorism. The United States is the Devil.”",

        "title": "House passes resolution condemning antisemitism",
        "text": "The House passed a Republican-led resolution on Tuesday condemning antisemitism in the United States and globally.\n     \n            A number of Democrats, however, expressed concern that the language of the GOP resolution is overly broad and would effectively define any criticism of the Israeli government or its policies as antisemitism. The vote was 311 to 14.\n     \n            Ninety-two Democrats voted “present,” and 13 Democrats and one Republican voted against the resolution.\n     \n            The vote comes as aid to Israel remains stalled in Congress amid Israel’s war against Hamas. There is widespread bipartisan support for aid to Israel, but the issue has become entangled with partisan disputes over other policy priorities, including the US Southern border, putting its passage in question.\n     \n            Ahead of the vote, Democratic Reps. Jerry Nadler and Daniel Goldman of New York and Jamie Raskin of Maryland urged their colleagues to vote “present” on the GOP resolution, describing it as a partisan attempt to score political points and saying that a bipartisan approach is needed.\n     \n            Nadler, Goldman and Raskin on Monday introduced an alternative resolution that condemns antisemitism and calls on executive branch agencies and Congress to implement the Biden administration’s national strategy to counter antisemitism.\n     \n            In remarks on the House floor, Nadler pointed to language in the GOP resolution stating that “anti-Zionism is antisemitism.”\n     \n            “That is either intellectually disingenuous or just factually wrong,” he said.\n     \n            “The authors, if they were at all familiar with Jewish history and culture, should know about Jewish anti-Zionism that was, and is, expressly not antisemitic,” he said.\n     \n            “Most anti-Zionism, particularly in this moment, has a real antisemitism problem. But we cannot fairly say that one equals the other,” he said.\n     \n            In November, the GOP-controlled House  passed a bill  to provide $14.3 billion in aid to Israel. Democrats, however, took issue with the bill over the fact that it would enact funding cuts to the Internal Revenue Service and would not include aid to Ukraine.\n     \n            Senate Republicans, on the other hand, have argued that aid for Ukraine and Israel must be paired with border policy changes, which has created a sticking point in that chamber.\n     \n            Separately, two House Democrats  are planning on introducing a resolution  this week condemning Hamas’ use of sexual violence and rape against Israeli women.\n     \n            Democratic Rep. Lois Frankel of Florida has begun drafting the resolution, a Democratic lawmaker familiar with the plans told CNN.\n     \n            A source familiar with Frankel’s thinking told CNN combating rape as a weapon of war is a long-standing priority for the congresswoman and the resolution was not drafted as a response to any comments made by other members.\n     \n            The move comes, however, in the wake of Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Rep. Pramila Jayapal’s comments to CNN’s Dana Bash that upset a number of her Democratic colleagues.\n     \n            While Jayapal condemned the rape of Israeli women by Hamas and called it “horrific”  on CNN’s “State of the Union,”  she pointed out that over 15,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since the start of the war and said, “I think we have to be balanced about bringing in the outrages against Palestinians.”\n     \n            Jayapal released a statement Tuesday afternoon saying, “Let me be completely clear again that I unequivocally condemn Hamas’ use of rape and sexual violence as an act of war. This is horrific and across the world, we must stand with our sisters, families, and survivors of rape and sexual assault everywhere to condemn this violence and hold perpetrators accountable.”\n     \n             This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n     \n             CNN’s Annie Grayer contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Deadly blasts have rattled Iran. As accusations fly, here’s what to know",
        "text": "ISIS has claimed responsibility for the deadliest attack in Iran since its 1979 Islamic Revolution, which has shaken the Islamic Republic and led to angry calls for vengeance.\n     \n            On Wednesday,  at least 84 people were killed  and 284 others injured in the Iranian city of Kerman after twin blasts near the burial site of slain military commander Qasem Soleimani.\n     \n            ISIS said Thursday that two bombers, who were brothers, had detonated their explosive vests as Shiite mourners gathered for the fourth anniversary of Soleimani’s assassination.\n     \n            The claim punctuates a tense few days of uncertainty as speculation mounted on whether Israel’s war with Gaza would   spread to other parts of the Middle East, potentially drawing in regional powers and the United States.\n     \n            Here’s what we know about the attacks in Kerman:\n     \n            ISIS media wing Al-Furqan issued a statement, titled “And Kill Them Wherever You Find Them,” on Thursday as they claimed responsibility for the twin blasts.\n     \n            They said that two brothers, who they named, set off towards a gathering of “polytheists” near the grave of their “dead leader” Qasem Soleimani, and detonated their explosive vests.\n     \n            They also warned the “polytheists” that the “mujahideen are lying in wait for them and their projects.”\n     \n            Islamic State considers the Shia branch of Islam to be heretical and has targeted shrines and religious sites in Iran previously.\n     \n            The group offered no further proof and their account of the blasts differs from that given by Iranian media. The death toll provided by ISIS was also significantly higher than that reported by Iranian officials.\n     \n            The first explosion was caused by a bomb placed in a suitcase in a car, and appeared to be detonated remotely, Iranian state television reported. The second, more deadly blast took place 20 minutes later, when people came to help the injured.\n     \n            No one claimed responsibility for the attack for more than 24 hours, during which time Iranian officials were quick to blame Israel and said it will pay for it.\n     \n            On Wednesday, the Israeli military told CNN it had “no comment” on the explosions.   Israel does not usually respond to allegations that it carried out operations against Iranian interests. Also on Wednesday, US State Department spokesperson Matt Miller told reporters the department had “no reason to believe that Israel was involved.”\n     \n      \n       RELATED VIDEO \n       U.S. intel assessment: Iran, proxies seek to avoid wider war with Israel \n     \n            Some Iranian figures were skeptical. “Washington says USA and Israel had no role in terrorist attack in Kerman, Iran. Really?” Mohammad Jamshidi, Raisi’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Political Affairs,  wrote on X , formerly Twitter.   \n     \n            Iran and Israel are  bitter enemies . Iran backs anti-Israel groups like Hamas and  Hezbollah , while Israel has vowed to prevent Tehran from getting a nuclear bomb and is accused by Iran of carrying out attacks to disrupt its nuclear program.\n     \n            On Thursday, US State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said that the US was aware of reports that ISIS had claimed responsibility, but said he was “not ready to offer a formal assessment.”\n     \n            He added that “this attack does bear all the hallmarks of an ISIS attack,” reiterating other US officials.\n     \n            Iran has yet to respond to the ISIS claim as of Thursday but both Iran’s official state news agency IRNA, as well as its English-language state media outlet Press TV, reported on ISIS’s claim of responsibility.\n     \n            ISIS is one of several adversaries the Islamic Republic has aside from Israel. These includes Iranian opposition and separatist groups inside the country and out.\n     \n            It faces separatist movements in the  Sistan-Baluchestan  province that borders Pakistan as well as Arab separatists in the Ahvaz province that borders Iraq, both of which are alleged to have carried out terrorist attacks in the country in recent years.\n     \n            Iran has also come under attack by ISIS and its affiliates several times in the past decade.\n     \n            Iran’s most prominent exiled opposition group is the  Mujahedin-e-Khalq , which Tehran accuses Saudi Arabia of backing. But that organization is not known to have committed terrorist acts inside Iran in years, and  Saudi Arabia’s relationship with Iran  has improved significantly since last year.\n     \n      \n       RELATED ARTICLE \n       Iran may not want a full-blown war with Israel, but it may be dragged into one \n     \n            Ali Vaez, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, wrote on X that if Israel was behind the attack, it would be part of a campaign of maximum provocation “to prompt Iran into committing a mistake that would justify expanding the war (with Hamas) and dragging the US in.”\n     \n            But he added that the attack didn’t bear the hallmarks of an Israeli operation, but rather those of ISIS or Baluchi separatists.\n     \n            Past attacks that Iran has blamed on Israel have typically targeted individuals, rather than larger groups of people, or facilities tied to to the regime’s nuclear program. Several nuclear scientists have died in targeted killings over the past decade.  Mohsen Fakhrizadeh , Iran’s chief nuclear scientist, was one of the highest-profile officials to be killed, in 2020. In 2021, Iran reported a blackout at the Natanz nuclear facility where uranium enrichment takes place, and blamed it  on Israel . Israel neither confirmed nor denied involvement in either attack.\n     \n            A senior White House official told reporters Wednesday that the blasts “look like a terrorist attack.” The official added that the attacks are “the type of thing we’ve seen ISIS do in the past” and that is “our going assumption at the moment.”\n     \n            ISIS and  Khorasan group , a branch of ISIS in Afghanistan, have a history of terrorist attacks in Iran and they tend to try and inflict higher civilian casualties, said Sanam Vakil, deputy head of the Middle East North Africa program at the Chatham House think tank in London.\n     \n            The blast in Kerman occurred amid heightened tensions in the region as Israel fights a three-month war against Hamas in Gaza prompted by the militant group’s October 7 attack on Israel.\n     \n            That war has led to skirmishes beyond Israel and Gaza, often involving Iran-backed militias.\n     \n            In Lebanon, a senior Hamas leader  was killed  on Tuesday in a suburb of Beirut in a blast that a US official told CNN was  carried out by Israel . Israel hasn’t confirmed or denied involvement but Hamas and the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, which controls the suburb, blamed Israel and both have vowed revenge.\n     \n            In Syria, Iran and several of its armed proxies accused Israel last week of  assassinating senior Iranian commander  Seyyed Razi, vowing retaliation. Israel didn’t comment on the matter.\n     \n            Israel accuses Tehran of funding and arming Hamas. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said last month that his country is in a “ multi-arena war ,” being attacked from seven arenas, including Iran. “We have already responded and acted in six of these decrees” he said.\n     \n            And in Iraq, a commander of a group in the Iran-backed Popular Mobilization Front (PMF) was killed on Thursday in an unidentified strike on their base in East Baghdad, a source with the PMF told CNN.\n     \n            Mushtaq Talib Al-Saadi, the commander also known as Abu Taqwa, was  killed after his vehicle was targeted  as he was entering the logistical support headquarters of Harakat al-Nujaba – an Iranian proxy operating in Iraq and Syria – the PMF source said. His assistant, Abu Sajjad, was also killed in the attack.\n     \n            A US official told CNN that the US had targeted a member of Harakat al-Nujaba. The official said the US had been watching the individual for some time before the strike and that he had “US blood on his hands.”\n     \n            Anger was already simmering in Iran over the killing of Mousavi﻿.   The Kerman attack adds to the Iranian government’s embarrassment, showing that not only is it unable to keep alive some of its top officials, but it also can’t prevent attacks on home soil.\n     \n            The regime may now be under increased pressure internally to punish the perpetrators.\n     \n            On Thursday, a  billboard was unveiled  on Tehran’s main square with the words: “Strong answer, God willing,” apparently calling on the government to respond harshly to the Kerman attack.\n     \n            Tehran had blamed Israel for the attack but it is unclear what the calculus is now that ISIS has claimed responsibility.\n     \n            Iran has reportedly plotted to kill Israelis in Europe and Asia in recent years in an effort to avenge Israel’s alleged operations against it, but it has failed. Right-wing critics of the Iranian government deem those attempts as  insufficient retaliation  for the killing of senior Iranian officials, Mohammad Mazhari wrote in a paper published by the Stimson Center, a Washington DC-based think tank.\n     \n            “Iranian officials are confused and divided regarding the appropriate method of exacting revenge,” Mazhari wrote ahead of the killing of Mousavi. “Their relative inaction is in line with a policy of strategic patience that seeks to avoid a direct confrontation with the US or Israel.”\n     \n      \n       RELATED VIDEO \n       Fears grow of wider war in Middle East amid deadly attacks \n     \n            Tehran is in an awkward position, said Vakil. “Pointing the finger at terror groups will provide Iran with a way out of this pressure,” she said. “It can blame Israel and the US for stoking regional unrest, but blame IS to avoid taking action.”\n     \n            Barbara Slavin, a fellow at the Stimson Center, told CNN’s Becky Anderson on Wednesday that Iran hasn’t been retaliating to attacks against it in a timely fashion “which raises the question… whether there’s concern about internal stability in the country.”\n     \n            In late 2022, Iran was rocked by some of the biggest protests since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, prompted by the death of a young woman at the hands of the country’s so-called morality police. Those protests were brutally crushed.\n     \n            “All in all, the Kerman attack has once again highlighted Iran’s vulnerability and the government’s failure in providing security,” Vaez wrote on X. “While the security forces seem adept at harassing women not wearing hijab, they fail to save their lives and protect them against terrorism.”\n     \n  CNN’s Samantha Waldenberg and Mostafa Salem contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Two Hamas terrorists are killed in high-speed freeway shoot-out caught on camera as Israeli motorcycle cop chases them down while firing pistol",
        "description": "",
        "text": "Two  Hamas  terrorists were killed in a high-speed chase down an  Israeli  highway after a police officer shot them with a pistol while firing his pistol.  Israeli authorities released a video of the incident, which is understood to have taken place on Highway 25, just north of the city of Nevitot, which lies just five miles from the border with Gaza.  Headcam footage, which appears to shows that the chase was heading towards Israel's border with Gaza, shows the motorcycle-riding officer taking out his service weapon and firing upon a gray car with its boot open.  After the marksman fires his weapon three times, the car is seen slowing down and turning to the rightly slightly, before coming to a full stop. Two more officers can be seen getting out of a police car and rapidly firing upon the vehicle.                            After the officer fires his weapon three times, the car is seen slowing down and turning to the rightly slightly             Israeli police said its officers killed two Hamas terrorists. Pictured: Headcam footage of the incident             The officer said 'eliminated, eliminated' as he shot the pair during the incident near the Gazan border    \n   The officer can be heard saying 'eliminated, eliminated' in Hebrew, before radioing in that 'two terrorists' were killed.  The cop then goes over to the car, where a pair of limp arms can be seen in the lap of an unnamed man.  It is not known exactly when the video was taken, but it appears to have been shot as deaths in the bloodiest conflict between Israel and  Palestine  for decades have skyrocketed in the last four days.  Palestine's health ministry said today that Israeli forces have killed 704 people, including 143 children and 105 women.  Israel, meanwhile, says that Hamas has killed over 900 people since Saturday, since the terror group launched a complex attack on Israel.  Israeli Police said in a post to X, formerly  Twitter , that officers from the country's border guard assisted in the incident.  The terrorists' deaths come hours after new dashcam footage of Hamas militants opening fire on unarmed civilians was published.  The footage was captured on a dashboard camera with a timestamp of 7.39am on Saturday morning, less than two hours after the surprise attack was launched.  The video opens with the car speeding down an otherwise abandoned road in southern Israel. One car is seen pulled over, while another is seen tipped on its side. As the vehicle rounds a bend in the road, dark-clad figures are seen in the distance, prompting the driver to slow the car down.                       This is the shocking moment Hamas militants opened fire on an Israeli civilian vehicle as its driver tried to flee the unprecedented assault by the terror group             Pictured: Aerial footage shows the aftermath of an attack on the Nova music Festival by Palestinian militants, near Kibbutz Reim in the Negev desert in southern Israel on October 8             Several cars - some of them burnt-out - are seen pulled over to the side of the road  after people fled the Nova music festival in southern Israel                 Footage shows terrified young Israelis fleeing Hamas militants as they launched a deadly attack on those attending the desert Nova music festival             As the car decelerates, one of these figures walks out into the middle of the road and another appears from the bushes down the left-hand-side of the tarmac. It quickly becomes clear that the two men are armed, and as the car steers to go around the first man, he raises a rifle and opens fire on the vehicle. Somehow, the driver manages initially to avoid the first two Hamas militants, but as the car steers around them, more fighters appear further down the road. Suddenly, the windscreen shatters as bullets slam into the car. It continues to roll down the road towards what is now in the footage clearly a Hamas roadblock. At least four more militants can be seen firing on the car, which veers slowly to the left and eventually comes to a halt when it crashes into the back of another vehicle that is pulled over to the side of the road - suggesting the driver has been shot dead.                It also comes after unearthed footage revealed that asenior Hamas commander warned that the group sees the domination of Israel as only the beginning.     \n   Footage of Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahar re-emerged, with the 78-year-old co-founder of the group vowing that they envisaged controlling an area far beyond Israel. 'When we speak about the army of Jerusalem and the Battle of the Promise of the Hereafter, we are not talking about liberating our land alone,' he said in a December to MEMRI TV - a news channel from the Israeli-founded, DC-based Middle East Media Research Institute. 'We believe in what our Prophet Muhammad said: \"Allah drew the ends of the world near one another for my sake, and I have seen its eastern and western ends. 'The dominion of my nation would reach those ends that have been drawn near me.\"Al-Zahar said he believes ultimately the whole world will fall into line with their views.

        "title": "What is UNRWA, and why have Western countries paused its funding amid Gaza war?",
        "description": "The US and eight other Western countries, which together provided more than half of UNRWA’s 2022 budget, have decided to pause funding for the agency. The development could have severe implications for Palestinians in Gaza.",
        "text": "UN officials on Sunday (January 28) urged countries to reconsider their decision to suspend the funding for the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), assuring that it would take strict action against any staff member found to be involved in Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel. The agency also highlighted that two million Palestinians in Gaza are dependent on UNRWA services that would be scaled back as soon as February if the funding is not restored. The US and eight other Western countries , which together provided more than half of UNRWA’s 2022  budget , cut the money after Israel accused some of the agency’s staff members of involvement in the October 7 attack. UNRWA stands for UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East. It was founded in 1949 to provide aid to about 700,000 Palestinians who were forced to leave their homes in what is now Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The UN agency operates in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank, as well as Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan — countries where the refugees took shelter after their expulsion. According to UNRWA’s website, it runs education, health, relief and social services, microfinance and emergency assistance programmes inside and outside refugee camps based in the aforementioned areas. Currently, around 5.9 million Palestine refugees — most of them are descendants of original refugees — access the agency’s services. The  Associated Press  reported that in Gaza, where some 85% of the enclave’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes after the latest Israel-Hamas conflict, over 1 million are sheltering in UNRWA schools and other facilities. UNRWA is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions by donor states like the US. It also gets a limited subsidy from the UN, which is used only for administrative costs, the agency’s website said.  Join us for Explained Live event on India’s space ambition The details of the accusations are scant. Israel has alleged that 12 staff members of UNRWA were involved in the October 7 attack. It has also claimed that Hamas siphons off funds given to UNRWA and fights from in and around the agency’s facilities. Israel has alleged that “Hamas tunnels (are) running next to or under UNRWA facilities and accuses the agency of teaching hatred of Israel in its schools,”  AP  reported. The UNRWA has denied all the allegations, saying it has no links to Hamas. In the statement, UN officials said out of 12 staff members who were accused of being involved in the attack, nine have been terminated. One is confirmed dead and the identity of the two others is being clarified. “Any UN employee involved in acts of terror will be held accountable, including through criminal prosecution,” the statement added. Chris Gunness, a former UNRWA spokesman, told  Al Jazeera  that the allegations against the agency are a “coordinated political attack” by Israel. “The Israelis have said they cannot win the war on Gaza unless UNRWA is disbanded. So what clearer signal do you want?” he added. UNRWA is crucial for the survival of people living in Gaza, which has plunged into a humanitarian crisis after the outbreak of the conflict. The agency has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians of the enclave. UNRWA, however, would run out of money needed for its aid work within weeks if the funding isn’t restored, according to Gunness. Stay informed with access to our award-winning journalism.

John Fetterman, D-Pa., criticized South Africa for bringing a genocide case against Israel in the United Nations' International Court of Justice, saying the African nation should focus on quelling unrest on its own continent.         \n        \n       The International Court of Justice in The Netherlands was set to hear oral arguments on Thursday in the case South Africa submitted in late December accusing Israel of genocide.  \"Who are they really fighting?\" Fetterman said of Hamas terrorists while speaking at the Orthodox Union luncheon in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. \" It’s a group of cowards. They hide in tunnels, they hide behind civilians, they attack, kill and mutilate children, women. And they do that. Stop talking about proportion on that. They shot their best shot on October 7th, and they would have taken more lives if they could do that.\"     \"Now we’re also talking about genocide,\" Fetterman continued. \"And now South Africa… bringing that kind of trial. Maybe South Africa ought to sit this one out when they’re talking about criticizing the behavior of another nation. Sit out!\"      \n        \n       CASSIDY UNVEILS BILL COSPONSORED BY FETTERMAN TO PROTECT COLLEGE STUDENTS FROM ANTISEMITISM, DISCRIMINATION     Sen. John Fetterman torched South Africa's genocide case against Israel.   (Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images)     The Associated Press reported in 2020 that White farmers and organizations representing them in South Africa have  called for farm killings  to be made a priority crime, but the South African government insists that White farmers are not being targeted because of their race, saying the violence is a result of South Africa’s high crime rate.  South Africa has one of the highest crime statistics in the world. A great deal of South Africa’s best farmland is owned by White farmers, as a result of the eviction of Black farmers when the country was ruled by a White minority. Although South Africa now has majority rule, land ownership remains a contentious issue, with parties like the leftist Economic Freedom Fighters mobilizing supporters and urging the government to seize White-owned land without compensation and return it to Black families.     \n        \n       Fetterman's office said he was not referring to the issue of White farmers. \"The entirety of my point was this: South Africa should instead focus on the spiraling humanitarian crises on its own continent—like Sudan where more than 7 million people have been displaced with widespread atrocities,\" the senator said in a statement. In the third quarter of 2023, South African farm attacks soared by 21% compared to the previous quarter, according to AfriForum, a non-profit civil rights organization. AfriForum’s Community Safety Division documented 88 farm attacks, including 13 farm murders, from July to September 2023.      In the second quarter from April to June, 73 farm attacks, including 23 murders, were recorded, the group said.          \n        \n       Fetterman, a Democrat who drew heavy criticism from conservatives during his campaign and following his victory over Dr. Mehmet Oz in 2022, has recently been championed by conservatives while drawing left-wing backlash over his stance on Israel.  \"The Fetterman 180 is the most amazing development in political history,\" conservative lawyer Marina Medvin wrote on X, sharing the clip.  \"John Fetterman is the only politician with the stones to stand up against the radicals in his own base, and it is beyond respectable,\" Harrison Krank wrote to his 244,000 followers, reshaping the clip originally posted on X by Dovi Safier.      Public hearings in South Africa's genocide case against Israel began at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, Netherlands on Jan. 11, 2024.

South Africa is seeking binding preliminary orders to compel Israel to stop its military campaign in Gaza.  The Palestinian health ministry, which is run by Hamas, claims more than 23,000 people have died and does not distinguish between civilian and militant casualties.      \n        \n       \"Genocides are never declared in advance, but this court has the benefit of the past 13 weeks of evidence that shows incontrovertibly a pattern of conduct and related intention that justifies as a plausible claim of genocidal acts,\" South African lawyer Adila Hassim told the judges and audience in the packed, ornate room of the Peace Palace in The Hague, according to the Associated Press. \"Nothing will stop the suffering except an order from this court.\"      Pro-Palestinian demonstrators outside the High Court in Cape Town on Jan. 11, 2024, in support of South Africa's landmark \"genocide\" case against Israel.    (Rodger Bosch/AFP via Getty Images)         Israel, however, says it is battling a fierce enemy in the Gaza Strip that carried out the deadliest attack on its territory in Israel's history, killing more than 1,200 people  on Oct. 7 . Israel says it is following international law and does its utmost to avoid harm to civilians. It blames Hamas for the high toll, saying the terror organization that had been controlling Gaza embeds in residential areas.

But South Africa reportedly turned a deaf ear to Israel's arguments, insisting the Jewish state committed genocide by design. \"The scale of destruction in Gaza, the targeting of family homes and civilians, the war being a war on children, all make clear that genocidal intent is both understood and has been put into practice. The articulated intent is the destruction of Palestinian life,\" lawyer Tembeka Ngcukaitobi said, according to the AP. \"What state would admit to a genocidal intent? Yet the distinctive feature of this case has not been the silence as such, but the reiteration and repetition of genocidal speech throughout every sphere of the state in Israel.\"      The Associated Press contributed to this report.      Danielle Wallace is a breaking news and politics reporter at Fox News Digital.

        "text": "This live blog is now closed, you can  read more of our Israel-Gaza war coverage here Hamas  issued a statement on Friday saying the  US -built pier off the  Gaza Strip  is no alternative to opening all land crossings under  Palestinian  supervision, adding that they reject any military presence on Palestinian land. Trucks carrying badly needed aid for the  Gaza  Strip started rolling across a newly built US pier and into Gaza for the first time. Friday’s shipment is the first in an operation that US military officials anticipate could scale up to 150 truckloads a day, reports the Associated Press (AP). It comes as  Israeli  restrictions on border crossings and heavy fighting hindered the delivery of food and other supplies seven months into the  Israel-Hamas  war. But the US and aid groups warn that the floating pier project is not a substitute for land deliveries that could bring in all the food, water and fuel needed in Gaza. It is 6pm in  Gaza  and in  Tel Aviv . We will be closing this blog soon, but you can stay up to date on the Guardian’s  Middle East  coverage  here . Here is a recap of the latest developments: Hamas issued a statement on Friday saying the US-built pier off the Gaza Strip is no alternative to opening all land crossings under Palestinian supervision, adding that they reject any military presence on Palestinian land.  Trucks carrying badly needed aid for the  Gaza  Strip started rolling across a newly built US pier and into Gaza for the first time. The bodies of three hostages kidnapped by Hamas, including the German-Israeli Shani Louk, have been retrieved from Gaza by the Israeli military, it announced.  The other two hostages were identified as Amit Buskila, 28, and Itzhak Gelerenter, 56, according to the military spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari, who said the three victims were taken to Gaza after being killed by  Hamas  at the Nova music festival. With key land crossings closed or operating at limited capacity due to fighting, some relief supplies have begun to flow into Gaza via a temporary, floating pier constructed by the US.  The Israeli army said 310 pallets began moving ashore in “the first entry of humanitarian aid through the floating pier”. In the coming days, about 500 tonnes of aid are expected to be delivered to Gaza through the pier , according to US Central Command (Centcom). US military officials anticipate the aid shipment operation could scale up to 150 truckloads a day. The EU welcomed the first shipment from Cyprus to the Gaza pier , but called on Israel to “expand deliveries by land and to immediately open additional crossings”. The US aid chief said the new sea corridor could not be a substitute for land crossings, and warned that deliveries of food and fuel entering Gaza had slowed to “dangerously low levels”.  The head of the US Agency for International Development (USAid), Samantha Power said: “Every moment that a crossing is not open, that trucks are not moving, or where aid cannot safely be distributed, increases the terrible human costs of this conflict.” Israel said it killed two senior Islamic Jihad militants in separate airstrikes in the northern West Bank and in Rafah.  The armed wing of Islamic Jihad confirmed that a local commander was killed in an overnight strike on the occupied West Bank’s Jenin refugee camp. However there was no immediate comment from the group on the army’s announcement that a “significant” operative was killed in Rafah. Austria said on Saturday it will restore its funding to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa)  after suspending it over allegations that staff were involved in the 7 October Hamas attacks. A total of €3.4m ($3.7m) in funds have been budgeted for 2024, and the first payment is expected to be made in the summer, Austria’s foreign ministry said in a statement. New divisions have emerged among Israel’s leaders over postwar Gaza’s governance , with an unexpected Hamas fightback in parts of the Palestinian territory piling pressure on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu came under personal attack from Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant for failing to rule out an Israeli government in  Gaza  after the war.  Netanyahu’s war planning also came under recent attack by army chief Herzi Halevi as well as top Shin Bet security agency officials , according to Israeli media reports. Israeli military said its air forces “struck over 70 targets” across the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours   while ground troops “continue precise operations” in eastern Rafah.  The Kuwaiti hospital said an overnight Israeli strike killed two people in a displacement camp in Rafah, with witnesses reporting heavy gunfire and shelling in the city’s south-east and jets bombarding its eastern areas. The army said its forces “conducted targeted raids” in Rafah and found weapons and explosives. The armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they fired anti-tank missiles and mortars at Israeli forces massing to the east, south-east and inside the Rafah border crossing  with Egypt. AFP correspondents, witnesses and medics said there were intense battles overnight in the northern Jabalia refugee camp, after the Israeli army reported on Friday “perhaps the fiercest” violence in the town in more than seven months of war.  Israeli forces “eliminated terrorists in a number of battles” in the Jabalia area and parts of central Gaza, the army said. Palestinian sources in Rafah told AFP that Israeli forces were operating in the city’s al-Salam and Jenina neighbourhood as well as on the Philadelphi route along the Egyptian border. “Troops are advancing and retreating around these areas,” a security source said. Cairo, which has been involved in mediation efforts during the war, says a potential Israeli takeover of Philadelphi could violate its landmark 1979 peace deal with Egypt. In northern Gaza’s Beit Lahia, witnesses reported airstrikes near Kamal Adwan hospital on Saturday.  The hospital’s director Hussam Abu Safiya told AFP on Friday that the facility, which has received “large numbers of injured and killed” from fighting in nearby Jabalia, was running low on medical supplies and fuel to power generators. At least 35,386 Palestinians have been killed and 79,366 have been wounded in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October , the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Saturday. The Hamas-run health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. German-Israeli Shani Louk’s father says that finally laying his daughter to rest will be a gift after her body was recovered from Gaza , months after she was killed in Hamas’s 7 October attack on southern  Israel . Nissim Louk said the funeral will be held on Sunday. One person was reportedly killed and other passengers were severely injured after a car was struck by a drone in the western part of Rafah , said Al Jazeera correspondent  Hani Mahmoud  on Saturday. Mahmoud, who is reporting from Deir el-Balah, said the car was on the way to central Gaza on the coastal road. The Guardian has been unable to independently verify the report. British security firm Ambrey said on Saturday it had received information that a Panama-flagged crude oil tanker had been attacked approximately 10 nautical miles southwest of Yemen’s Mokha.  Ambrey later added that the tanker had received assistance and one of its steering units was reportedly functional. It did not indicate who provided the assistance. Earlier on Saturday, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency said a vessel in the Red Sea was struck by an unknown object and sustained slight damage.  “The vessel and crew are safe and continuing to its next port of call,” UKMTO said in an advisory note, adding the incident occurred 76 nautical miles northwest of Yemen’s Hodeidah. Palestinian  sources in  Rafah  told AFP that  Israeli  forces were operating in the city’s  al-Salam  and  Jenina  neighbourhood as well as on the  Philadelphi route  along the  Egyptian  border. “Troops are advancing and retreating around these areas,” a security source said. Cairo , which has been involved in mediation efforts during the war, says a potential Israeli takeover of Philadelphi could violate its landmark 1979 peace deal with Egypt, writes AFP. In northern Gaza’s  Beit Lahia , witnesses reported airstrikes near  Kamal Adwan hospital  on Saturday, according to the news agency. The hospital’s director  Hussam Abu Safiya  told AFP on Friday that the facility, which has received “large numbers of injured and killed” from fighting in nearby  Jabalia , was running low on medical supplies and fuel to power generators. The fuel aid that had reached the hospital was “barely enough for a few days”, Abu Safiya said. The  World Health Organization  has received no medical supplies in Gaza since the Rafah operation began on 6 May, spokesperson  Tarik Jasarevic  said on Friday. Israel said it killed two senior  Islamic Jihad  militants in separate airstrikes in the  northern West Bank  and in Rafah. The armed wing of Islamic Jihad confirmed that a local commander was killed in an overnight strike on the occupied West Bank’s Jenin refugee camp ( see 14.36 BST ). However there was no immediate comment from the group, which has fought alongside  Hamas , on the army’s announcement that a “significant” operative was killed in Rafah. According to AFP, a military statement did not name the slain militant and said he had been involved in “preparing … for operations against IDF [army] ground troops in the area”. With key land crossings closed or operating at limited capacity due to fighting, some relief supplies have begun to flow into  Gaza  via a temporary, floating pier constructed by the  US , reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The  Israeli  army said 310 pallets began moving ashore in “the first entry of humanitarian aid through the floating pier”. In the coming days, about 500 tonnes of aid are expected to be delivered to Gaza through the pier, according to  US Central Command (Centcom) . But  UN  agencies and humanitarian aid groups have warned sea or air deliveries cannot replace far more efficient truck convoys into Gaza, where the UN has repeatedly warned of looming famine. According to AFP, the  EU  welcomed the first shipment from  Cyprus  to the Gaza pier, but called on Israel to “expand deliveries by land and to immediately open additional crossings”. The  Rafah crossing , a vital conduit for humanitarian assistance, has been closed since the Israeli Rafah operation began early last week. Israeli  military said its air forces “struck over 70 targets” across the  Gaza Strip  over the past 24 hours while ground troops “continue precise operations” in eastern  Rafah , reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). More than 10 days into what the Israeli military called a “limited” operation in Rafah that triggered an exodus of  Palestinians  sheltering there, fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants has also flared again in Gaza’s north, according to the news agency. The  Kuwaiti hospital  said an overnight Israeli strike killed two people in a displacement camp in Rafah, with witnesses reporting heavy gunfire and shelling in the city’s southeast and jets bombarding its eastern areas. The army said its forces “conducted targeted raids” in Rafah and found weapons and explosives, report AFP. AFP correspondents, witnesses and medics said there were intense battles overnight in the northern  Jabalia refugee camp , after the Israeli army reported on Friday “perhaps the fiercest” violence in the town in more than seven months of war. Israeli forces “eliminated terrorists in a number of battles” in the Jabalia area and parts of central Gaza, the army said. According to AFP’s report, Israel in early January said it had dismantled  Hamas ’s command structure in northern Gaza, but the army said the Palestinian group “was in complete control here in Jabalia until we arrived a few days ago”. Israel Defense Forces (IDF)  say they killed a  senior Palestinian militant  during an airstrike on an “operations centre” in the  occupied  West Bank  city of  Jenin . “A number of significant terrorists were inside the compound,” the IDF said in a statement posted to Telegram. The strike, carried out on Friday night by a fighter jet and a helicopter, killed  Islam Khamayseh , a “senior terrorist operative in the Jenin camp” who was responsible for a series of attacks in the area, the IDF said. Al-Quds Brigade , the armed wing of the militant group  Palestinian Islamic Jihad , confirmed in a statement that one of their members was killed and several others wounded during the Israeli raid. Al-Quds Brigade said Khamayseh was a leader of the  Jenin battalion , which is affiliated with  Islamic Jihad . The  Palestinian Ministry of Health  said one person was killed while eight were wounded and receiving hospital treatment as a result of the strike. With thousands now held without charge, lawyers say  Israel  is  \n   signalling that no detainee is safe, write  Ruth Michaelson ,  Sufian Taha  and  Quique Kierszenbaum  in  Jerusalem  and  Ramallah : Marwan Barghouti  spends his days huddled in a cramped, dark, solitary cell, with no way to tend to his wounds, and a shoulder injury from being dragged with his hands cuffed behind his back. Barghouti holds almost mythic status within  Palestinian  politics, seen as a figure whose potential to unify different factions has only grown during his 24 years in prison. “Mentally he’s a very strong person, but physically his condition is deteriorating, you can see it. He’s struggling to see out of his right eye, as a result of one of the assaults,” said his lawyer  Igal Dotan , who visited Barghouti in  Israel ’s  Megiddo prison  two months ago. “He has lost weight – he doesn’t look good. You wouldn’t recognise him if you compare his current appearance with the famous photos of him,” he said. Israel jailed  Barghouti on five counts of murder  while accusing him of directing attacks against civilians, which he denies. His lawyers and supporters fear that as one of the highest profile Palestinian detainees, he was abused to send a message to others that no one is safe. He has been moved to three different detention facilities since October, each time held in solitary confinement. Last December in  Ayalon prison , “he was beaten on several occasions,” said Dotan, including an incident where guards swore at him while Barghouti was “dragged on the floor naked in front of other prisoners”. “What Barghouti has endured amounts to torture, but that has become standard across all detention facilities since 7 October,” said  Tal Steiner , of the rights group the  Public Committee Against Torture in Israel . The  Israeli prison service  did not respond when contacted for comment. Both PCATI and the  International Committee of the Red Cross  have been denied formerly routine visits to Israeli prisons since last October. You can read the full version of this story here: German-Israeli Shani Louk ’s father says that finally laying his daughter to rest will be a gift after her body was recovered from  Gaza , months after she was killed in  Hamas ’s 7 October attack on southern  Israel , reports Reuters. Louk, a 23-year-old tattoo artist, was celebrating with friends at the  Nova music festival  just inside Israel before it was attacked by gunmen from the Palestinian militant group. Her body was soon seen in a video, slung across the back of a pickup truck, surrounded by gunmen and paraded through  Gaza . On Friday, the Israeli military informed her parents,  Nissim  and  Ricarda Louk , that their daughter’s body had been found by Israeli commandos in Gaza. Nissim Louk said that to be sure, he had viewed photos. “We also saw the tattoos on her hands,” he said on Saturday. “Now she will have her own place next to us and we can go there whenever we want. And she can rest.” According to Reuters, he said the funeral will be held on Sunday, which is Ricarda Louk’s birthday.  \n Having Shani’s grave nearby would be a comfort, said Ricarda Louk.  \n “Maybe we’ll find more peace,” she said. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that new divisions have emerged among  Israel ’s leaders over postwar  Gaza ’s governance, with an unexpected  Hamas  fightback in parts of the Palestinian territory piling pressure on prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu . Netanyahu came under personal attack from Israeli defence minister  Yoav Gallant  for failing to rule out an Israeli government in  Gaza  after the war. According to AFP, the Israeli premier’s outright rejection of postwar  Palestinian  leadership in Gaza has broken a rift among top politicians wide open and frustrated relations with top ally the  US . AFP spoke to experts who said that the lack of clarity only serves to benefit  Hamas , whose leader has insisted no new authority can be established in the territory without its involvement. “Without an alternative to fill the vacuum, Hamas will continue to grow,”  International Crisis Group  analyst  Mairav Zonszein  told AFP. Emmanuel Navon , a lecturer at  Tel Aviv University , echoed this sentiment. Navon told AFP: “If only Hamas is left in Gaza, of course they are going to appear here and there and the Israeli army will be forced to chase them around. Either you establish an Israeli military government or an Arab-led government.” Gallant said in a televised address on Wednesday: “I call on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to make a decision and declare that Israel will not establish civilian control over the Gaza Strip.” Netanyahu’s war planning also came under recent attack by army chief  Herzi Halevi  as well as top  Shin Bet  security agency officials, according to Israeli media reports. Washington  has previously called for a “revitalised” form of the  Palestinian Authority  to govern Gaza after the war, but Netanyahu has rejected any role for the Palestinian Authority in postwar Gaza. Speaking on Thursday, Netanyahu said that it “supports terror, educates terror, finances terror”. With Gallant's criticism of Netanyahu's failure to plan for the day after in terms of governing  #Gaza , some real fissures are beginning to emerge in the Israeli war cabinet. I'm not sure I know of many people, including the most ardent 🇮🇱 supporters, who have confidence in Bibi. “With Gallant’s criticism of Netanyahu’s failure to plan for the day after in terms of governing Gaza, some real fissures are beginning to emerge in the Israeli war cabinet,”  Colin P Clarke , director of policy and research at the  Soufan Group  thinktank, wrote on X. In case you missed it last night, humanitarian assistance has begun to arrive in  Gaza  along a US-made pier, but the US aid chief said the new sea corridor could not be a substitute for land crossings, and warned that deliveries of food and fuel entering Gaza had slowed to “dangerously low levels”. The White House national security spokesperson, John Kirby, confirmed on Friday that truckloads of humanitarian aid, including food from the United Arab Emirates, sent by ship from Cyprus, had been unloaded on the Gaza coast and handed over to the control of the UN. Kirby told reporters at a White House briefing: “Hopefully by the time we’re done here, some of that stuff will actually be in the mouths of some hungry people.” The Associated Press, however, quoted an unnamed UN official as saying distribution of the shipment had not begun as of Friday afternoon. Here are some of the latest images from  Jenin  in the  occupied West Bank  after an  Israeli  airstrike that the  Israel Defense Forces (IDF)  said killed a  senior Palestinian militant . Austria  said on Saturday it will restore its funding to the  UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa)  after suspending it over allegations that staff were involved in the 7 October  Hamas  attacks, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Israel  alleged in January that some Unrwa employees may have participated in the Hamas attacks on 7 October and in the weeks that followed, numerous donor states, including Austria, suspended or paused $450m in funding. Many donor countries, including  Germany ,  Sweden ,  Canada  and  Japan , had since resumed funding. “After analysing the action plan in detail” submitted by Unrwa “to improve the functioning of the organisation”, Austria has decided to “release the funds,” its foreign ministry said in a statement, reports AFP. A total of €3.4m ($3.7m) in funds have been budgeted for 2024, and the first payment is expected to be made in the summer, the statement said. “Some of the Austrian funds will be used in the future to improve internal control mechanisms at Unrwa,” it added. According to AFP, Austria said it will “closely monitor” the implementation of the action plan with other international partners, noting that “a lot of trust had been squandered”. Austria said it has substantially increased support for the  Palestinian  population in  Gaza  and the region since 7 October, making €32m($34.8m) in humanitarian aid available to other international aid organisations. One person has been killed and other passengers have been severely injured after a car was struck by a drone in the western part of  Rafah , reports Al Jazeera correspondent  Hani Mahmoud . Mahmoud, who is reporting from  Deir el-Balah , said the car was on the way to  central Gaza  on the coastal road. The Guardian has been unable to independently verify the report. At least 35,386  Palestinians  have been killed and 79,366 have been wounded in  Israel ’s military offensive on  Gaza  since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Saturday. The  Hamas -run health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.",

        "title": "A new Dutch parliament has been sworn in after Wilders’ victory in the national election 2 weeks ago",
        "text": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A new lower house of the Dutch parliament was sworn in Wednesday, two weeks after the far-right party of lawmaker  Geert Wilders  won a general election in  a seismic shift that reverberated through Europe . While the newly configured Second Chamber is now installed, talks to form a new ruling coalition remain at an early stage, with a “scout” still talking to leaders about possible combinations to succeed the last four-party administration led by Prime Minister  Mark Rutte . The scout is expected to send a report to parliament before a debate, likely next week, on the next step in the coalition formation process. Rutte, the Netherlands’ longest serving premier, will remain in office until a new coalition is formed and sworn in.  Talks to form Rutte’s final coalition  took some nine months, a record. Wilders’ anti-Islam, anti-immigration Party for Freedom won 37 seats in the 150-seat Second Chamber of Parliament in the Nov. 22 election, putting him in pole position to succeed Rutte. But at least two potential coalition partners are balking at some of his policy pledges that they consider unconstitutional. \n     \n\n The New Social Contract of former Christian Democrat lawmaker Pieter Omtzigt has 20 seats in the new parliament, but is so far reluctant to commit to joining Wilders in a coalition. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n             \n                 \n                    RELATED COVERAGE\n                 \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Desi Bouterse, a dictator convicted of murder who twice ruled Suriname, has died at 79 \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 NATO chief warns that Putin wants long-term confrontation with Europe after Ukraine \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 A Dutch court weighs a lawsuit against arms sales to Israel \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Among Wilders’ campaign pledges is for “No Islamic schools, Qurans and mosques” in the country, though his manifesto doesn’t outline how he would achieve that goal.

        "text": "Campus unrest grows over Israel-Hamas war   FOX News' Alexis McAdams speaks with students at Columbia University about antisemitism on college campuses and pro-Palestinian rallies nationwide on 'Special Report.'   Yale Daily News (YDN), the  independent student newspaper  and oldest college daily in the country, retracted editor's notes that targeted a pair of recent pro-Israel columns after a huge backlash. The editor's notes took issue with statements in both pieces that \"Hamas raped women,\" calling them \"unsubstantiated claims.\"         \n        \n       An Oct. 12 column by Yale student Sahar Tartak titled,  \"Is Yalies4Palestine a hate group?\"  was hit with an editor's note without Tartak's initial knowledge, reading, \"This column has been edited to remove unsubstantiated claims that Hamas raped women and beheaded men.\"  Another column published on Oct. 13, titled \"Stop justifying terrorism,\" similarly accused the terror group of raping women during the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and also had an editor's note added.      \"The News was wrong to publish the corrections,\"  the newspaper later wrote  on Tuesday. \"By the time of the first correction on Oct. 25, there had been widely reported coverage from outlets such as Reuters publicly verifying that Hamas raped and beheaded Israelis.\"      \n        \n       ISRAELI OFFICIALS IDENTIFY SHANI LOUK'S BODY, BEHEADED BY 'SADISTIC ANIMALS'     Yale Daily News (YDN), an independent student newspaper and the oldest college daily in the country, retracted an editor's note that was targeted against a pro-Israel column written by a Yale student on Tuesday.    (Getty Images)     There have been multiple reports that Hamas terrorists committed rape during their rampage. Israel released footage of one captured attacker who said they were given permission to rape the corpse of a girl, according to  The Times of Israel . NBC News reported on \"signs of rape\" in videos of the attack presented to journalists last week. Military forensic teams in Israel also said they found signs of torture and rape among the victims, according to Reuters. Additionally, Shani Louk, a German-Israeli citizen who was kidnapped by Hamas and paraded unconscious on the back of a truck, as seen in footage of the Oct. 7 massacre, was discovered dead and beheaded, according to Israeli government officials.     \n        \n       The Yale newspaper wrote that it \"failed to ensure that the columnists’ statements were properly cited and attributed\" during its editing process because \"[a]t the time of the columns’ initial publication, those specific forms of violence during Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack were not independently confirmed by the cited source.\" WHO IS SHANI LOUK?

Italian Foreign Minister  Antonio Tajani , who chaired the meeting of ministers of industrialized countries, said the agenda of the three-day meeting was changed on Friday to address the latest developments. Early Friday, Iran fired air defenses at a major air base and a nuclear site near the central city of Isfahan after spotting drones. They were suspected to be part of an Israeli attack in retaliation for Tehran’s unprecedented drone-and-missile assault on the country last weekend. Tajani didn’t immediately address the incident, but said that G7 ministers condemned Iran’s weekend attack on Israel and urged both sides to exercise restraint. “The political objective is de-escalation,” Tajani said in a closing press conference.",

        "title": "Elizabeth Magill: UPenn president quits in antisemitism row",
        "text": "A US university president has quit after her comments about antisemitism on campus during a Congressional hearing triggered a major backlash. Elizabeth Magill, president of the University of Pennsylvania, refused to say  whether students who called for the genocide of Jews would be punished . The university said she \"voluntarily tendered her resignation\" but will stay in post until a replacement is found. Ms Magill has previously apologised for her testimony. She made the controversial comments while appearing in front of a House of Representatives committee on 5 December alongside the presidents of Harvard and MIT, Claudine Gay and Sally Kornbluth.  They were asked by Republican New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik: \"Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate [your university's] code of conduct or rules regarding bullying and harassment? Yes or no?\" Ms Magill and her MIT and Harvard counterparts said repeatedly it would depend on the \"context\" and have been criticised for not flatly condemning any calls for the genocide of Jews. US students grapple with free speech and antisemitism The Congressional hearing was held amid widespread campus protests sparked by the Israel-Gaza conflict and a rising number of antisemitism incidents. In a video statement released after the hearing, Ms Magill apologised for her testimony, but calls for her to step down have continued in recent days. She was criticised by the White House, and a major donor who had planned to give the university $100m (£79.3m) pulled out, saying he was \"appalled\" at Ms Magill's comments.  On Thursday, two students at the university - both of whom are Jewish - filed a lawsuit, claiming the campus has become \"an incubation lab for virulent anti-Jewish hatred, harassment and discrimination.\" Ms Magill's resignation was confirmed by Scott L. Bok, chair of the Penn board of trustees. He said Ms Magill would step down as president but \"will remain a tenured faculty member at Penn Carey Law\". Trustees had reportedly been due to meet on Sunday to discuss Ms Magill's position. In a statement released via the university after her resignation was confirmed, Ms Magill said: \"It has been my privilege to serve as President of this remarkable institution.  \"It has been an honor to work with our faculty, students, staff, alumni, and community members to advance Penn's vital missions.\" The University of Pennsylvania - commonly known as UPenn - is among the oldest and most prestigious universities in the US, and is part of the elite Ivy League group alongside institutions such as Harvard and Yale.",

        "text": "A young woman who was left with a 'catastrophic spinal injury' after the lead singer of an Australian punk rock band dived into the audience to crowd surf is expected to make a full recovery. Bird Piché, 24, was left 'scared' and unable to move after singer John Floreani, from  Newcastle-based band Trophy Eyes,  jumped into the mosh pit at their show in  Buffalo, New York, in April. Ms Piché and her family told  NBC News  she had regained use of her arms and some leg function, but not full use of her hands and toes. 'When you hear about these types of injuries, they're obviously very serious, so I didn't expect to have any recovery,' Ms Piché said.  Ms Piché now has recovered gross motor skills - the most basic movements of arms and legs. She is hoping to develop fine motor skills and the ability to make intricate finger and toe movements to achieve basic, everyday tasks.

My fingers don't have full movement,' Ms Piché said. She also revealed her legs were making spontaneous kicking movements. Ms Piché said she had been going to rehab and her prognosis was very positive. 'They do think I'll have full recovery. Nothing is certain, obviously, but they are predicting l will have full recovery of everything,' she said. Ms Piché has a clear recollection of when Floreani leapt backwards into the crowd. 'It was, like, his body and my neck, it was a crowd-surfing thing.' Ms Piché's family had grave fears for her after the incident. 'We were even worried she wasn't going to make it,' her mother Amy Leigh Flaminio said. 'It's going to be a long road, but the early signs are so promising. It's exciting.' Following the accident, the band said in a statement they were 'truly heartbroken' but had decided to continue with their American tour. 'This situation has shaken us all to our core, and we ask for patience while we look to help Bird navigate this difficult time. Please, keep Bird in your thoughts,' they said. The show, at Buffalo's Mohawk Place, was immediately stopped and Floreani accompanied Ms Piché to hospital with her family.

'There are signs posted everywhere in the venue and notice was included in the emails for this show with the show's promoter and the band themselves,' he said in a statement.

Ralph Northam’s 2019  remarks about aborting babies  after birth, part of an extended commentary by the former president about his belief in state autonomy and legal access to the procedure in cases of rape, incest and the health of the mother. \n\n\n \n\n\n “You can look at the governor of West Virginia, the previous governor of West Virginia … he said, ‘the baby will be born and we will decide what to do with the baby. In other words, we’ll execute the baby,'” Trump said, misidentifying Northam’s state. “The Democrats are radical in that.” \n\n\n\n “There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it’s born,” stated Davis after Trump concluded, drawing howls from conservatives who noted that six states and the District of Columbia currently do not place any limits on the procedure. \n\n\n\n At one point near the end of the debate, a Trump campaign spokesperson texted a Post reporter “3 on 1” in reference to the dynamic on the National Constitution Center stage. \n\n\n\n \n\t \n\t\t\n \n\t \n \n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t 6 \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris speaks during a presidential debate with former President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Sept. 10, 2024.   AFP via Getty Images \n\n\n\n Harris, meanwhile, delivered a far stronger appearance than the  dismal showing by Biden in June that stoked Democratic fears  of a Trump landslide victory — with the former prosecutor avoiding major gaffes and deflecting potentially damaging questions about her record and evolving stances on a range of major issues. \n\n\n\n The VP was helped by her opponent, who proved unable to resist when Harris used what she described as Trump’s strategy of “lies, grievances and name-calling” against him. \n\n\n\n In one illuminating exchange, after Harris accused Trump of persuading Capitol Hill Republicans to kill a border security spending bill, she claimed his signature rallies had lost their action-packed, blockbuster quality. \n\n\n\n \n\t \n\t\t\n \n\t \n \n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t 6 \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Members of the ABC television crew, including moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis, pose for photos following a presidential debate between Trump and Harris hosted by ABC on Sept. 10, 2024.  REUTERS \n\n\n\n Rather than responding to the immigration attack, Trump defended his showmanship: “People don’t go to her rallies. There’s no reason to go. And the people that do go, she’s busing them in and paying them to be there and then showing them in a different light, so she can’t talk about that.  \n\n\n \t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\tSee Also\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \t\t \n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\tKamala Harris did just enough in the debate — with help from ABC\t \n \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\t\t \n\t \n\t \n\n\n “People don’t leave,” the former president went on. “We have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics. That’s because people want to take their country back. Our country is being lost. We’re a failing nation.” \n\n\n\n Ahead of the debate, Republicans focused on Harris’ close friendship with  Dana Walden, a senior Disney executive whose portfolio includes ABC News , and questioned the impartiality of the network. \n\n\n\n Those fears appeared justified as the debate gave cursory focus to Harris’ liabilities, including a series of policy flip-flops on stances from her 2019 run for president — such as past vows to  eliminate private health insurance ,  decriminalize illegal border crossings ,  ban fracking for oil and natural gas , and  ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035  — and her role as Biden’s designated point person on reducing illegal immigration, which surged to annual record highs in the first three years of her role as the so-called “border czar.” \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Catch up on The Post’s debate coverage \n\n\n\n \n Kamala Harris’ dismissive laugh on full display in first presidential debate with Trump \n\n\n\n Taylor Swift endorses Kamala Harris minutes after presidential debate: ‘I’ve made my choice’ \n\n\n\n Read Trump’s and Harris’ closing statements from their first presidential debate \n\n\n\n Harris campaign calls for second debate after Trump’s performance is panned by critics \n\n\n\n Trump refers to Kamala Harris’ 2020 viral ‘I’m speaking’ moment in presidential debate: ‘Does that sound familiar?’ \n\n\n\n Harris tries to pin Project 2025 on Trump during first minutes of presidential debate \n\n\n\n Trump claims Harris supports abortions in the ‘ninth month — and she doesn’t deny it’ during presidential debate \n\n\n\n Everything to know about the Donald Trump-Kamala Harris presidential debate \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Trump allies and Republican commentators were left fuming and compiling a long list of missed opportunities for Muir and Davis to fact-check Harris, such as when she said that police had died during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, that Trump had imperiled access to IVF treatment, and that Trump would implement the provisions of the right-wing Project 2025 governing blueprint, despite the former president disavowing it repeatedly. \n\n\n\n Other alleged falsehoods by Harris that went unchallenged included her comment that Trump was threatening a “bloodbath” if he lost the election,  when the context of that remark was in reference to the US auto industry , and for invoking his statement in 2017 that there were  “very fine people” on both sides of Charlottesville race riot,  when the ex-president’s supporters insist he was not referring to the white supremacists involved. \n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t 6 \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Trump, 78, found himself having to answer not only Harris’ repeated and pointed attacks on both his pride and policy but also a pair of moderators who quibbled with some of his statements despite what his supporters viewed as a lack of even-handedness.  AP \n\n\n\n “David Muir is out of control,” tweeted Tom Fitton, president of the conservative Judicial Watch,  writing , “It isn’t ‘fact-checking,’ it is attacking.” \n\n\n\n “ABC is making a huge mistake trying to fact check this live. They’re only proving how biased they are. Harris fabricated an attack on Trump over IVF. ABC sat there and said nothing,”  tweeted  Ari Fleischer, a White House press secretary under President George W. Bush. \n\n\n\n “She’s shaking her head as he mentions her Minnesota bail fund action, which is a fact. Her tweet is still live,”  tweeted  conservative political commentator Guy Benson. \n\n\n\n \n\t \n\t\t\n \n\t \n \n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t 6 \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Harris, 59, arrived well prepared to rattle Trump by claiming that military leaders told her that her rival was a “disgrace,” and that world leaders were “laughing” at him.   AFP via Getty Images \n\n\n\n “Harris just said that police died on January 6th[.] No police died on January 6th[.] It’s a blatant lie from Harris — yet ABC doesn’t fact check it,”  tweeted  Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire. \n\n\n\n Sen.

There may be some differences between the audio and the text. Taylor Wilson: Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson, and this is 5 Things you need to know Friday, the 13th of October 2023. Today, more chaos on Capitol Hill, plus Israel calls for evacuations in parts of Gaza, and there's a new map of the human brain. ♦ The House fell into more chaos last night after Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise withdrew from the speaker's race. That's despite being formally nominated this week by the House Republican Conference. Scalise was expected to launch a speakership bid following the ouster, former speaker Kevin McCarthy last week, but uncertainty surrounded his bid for speaker even after he was formally nominated on Wednesday. Some lawmakers had expressed concerns over Scalise's health since he's currently battling blood cancer. House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan was Scalise's main rival in the speaker's race, but he lost the internal conference vote to be nominated this week. It's now uncertain if he'll seek the nomination again and even more uncertain if he can unite a fractured House GOP conference behind him. Without a speaker, the House remains paralyzed and unable to take any legislative action. ♦ The Israel Defense Forces called for an evacuation of all civilians in Gaza City earlier today. That's after the United Nations said it received a warning from Israel to evacuate 1.1 million people living in the north of Gaza within 24 hours. The military warned and civilians that armed forces would be operating in the city in the coming days. What that operation looks like remains to be seen. Enas Hamdan, an officer at the UN Palestinian Refugee Agency in Gaza City said, \"This is chaos. No one understands what to do.\" Alarmed civilians and aid workers already in distress from Israeli airstrikes and a blockade have been sent into chaos. And a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent told the Associated Press that there was no way a million people could evacuate that fast. An Israeli bombardment this week has killed more than 1500 people in Gaza, and more than 400,000 people, accounting for around 18% of Gaza's population, have fled their homes, many of them packing into schools run by the United Nations. Israeli officials say a siege will continue until Hamas militants free the 150 or so hostages captured in last weekend's assault. Since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 both Israel and Egypt have imposed a blockade restricting the movement of people and goods in and out of the territory. Hamas' unprecedented attack last Saturday in Israel, along with days of heavy rocket fire since have killed more than 1300 people in Israel. ♦ Jurors convicted a Colorado police officer yesterday and acquitted a former officer of charges in the 2019 death of Elijah McClain. He was a Black man who died after being stopped by police in a Denver suburb. Aurora police officer Randy Roedema was found guilty of criminally negligent homicide and third degree assault. A jury found Jason Rosenblatt, who was fired in 2020, not guilty on all charges. In closing arguments, prosecutors reminded jurors that McClain, a 23-year-old massage therapist, was walking home in 2019 when he was stopped by police and violently restrained. He was not armed or accused of committing a crime, but a 911 caller had reported a man who seemed sketchy. Roedema, Rosenblatt and another officer, Nathan Woodyard, pinned McClain to the ground and placed him in a since band chokehold. And before paramedics arrived, he was injected with the powerful sedative ketamine. McClain died days later. The city later agreed to pay $15 million to settle a federal civil rights lawsuit brought by his parents. An amended autopsy report released last year determined that McClain died because of complications of ketamine administration following forcible restraint. In court, prosecutors played video of the struggle and witnesses testified that though the ketamine killed him, he likely inhaled vomit into his lungs while being restrained, making it harder to breathe.

I spoke with USA Today national correspondent, Deborah Barfield Berry, about their popularity amid efforts to restrict Black history teachings in public schools. Deborah, thanks for hopping on 5 Things. Deborah Barfield Berry: Thank you for having me. Taylor Wilson: What are we hearing from museums around the country? Deborah Barfield Berry: What I've been hearing from several directors of museums as well as the head of the African-American Museum Association, is that they have been experiencing some growth in visitors, but not just in terms of just growth of visitors, but that there's a growing interest in what they do in the space that they provide. And some of them are talking about even offering some classes on African-American studies separate from their coming to the museum. And the group of historians had their annual conference in Florida to talk about what they are trying to do, how they are trying to teach other people how to teach Black history because it has become so much of an issue. Taylor Wilson: Why is Black history seeing this renewed interest nationwide now? Deborah Barfield Berry: Part of it is actually in response to a pushback in some states to restrict the teaching of African-American studies or Black history in some places. Some of it is in response to the banning of books. And in many cases, some of those books are books written by Black authors. So what there has been is a renewed interest in or a resurgence of interest in learning about Black history, whether it's in a classroom, whether it's in a church, or whether it's going to Black museums. Taylor Wilson: Deborah, debates over Black history and how to teach it are nothing new in this country. What has this conversation been like historically and how is it influencing what we're seeing today? Deborah Barfield Berry: Well, as you said, it's not new. There's been different levels of debate about it. What has brought it more to the forefront is the fact that some states and/or education departments are going the extra step or the extra mile in trying to restrict it. So in response to that, people have been more riled up or are more angry, more upset or more disappointed in how it's being handled. So they say, \"Okay, well, if you're not going to teach it, then we're going to teach it. We're going to make sure our children and our adults know what the history of Africans in America looks like. And it won't be a watered down version.\" Again, their language, \"It won't be a watered down version. It won't be a restricted version. It will be the truth as we know it, the truth as we see it, the truth as we teach it.\" Taylor Wilson: And museums aren't the only organizations that have seen interest grow recently around Black history. Deborah, what other groups are seeing the same? Deborah Barfield Berry: Some of the groups that share and teach the African-American experience. One example that I use in a story, which I actually had been on one of their tours, is the Gullah Geechee Heritage Tours Group. They said in the recent years, and particularly in the recent months, they've seen many more Black customers. It used to be all white customers. Now they're seeing more Black customers. They can't say that it's just about this response to the history, but the timing is what it is, and they're welcoming that and they think, for some reason, there's a whole lot more interest in learning about history. Gullah Geechee is one of the richest histories of Africans in America. And so there's been much more of an increase in customers there. Taylor Wilson: Deborah Barfield Berry, thanks for your insight here. Really appreciate it. Deborah Barfield Berry: Thank you for having me. ♦ Taylor Wilson: There's a new map of the human brain. I caught up with USA Today health reporter, Karen Weintraub, to find out what implications that could have for treating brain diseases and more. Hello, Karen. Karen Weintraub: Hello. Thanks for having me. Taylor Wilson: Thanks for hopping back on. So what has this latest research found? Karen Weintraub: They looked at the human brain at a cellular level that had never been done in this amount of detail before. Somebody compared it to me that before we kind of had the rough outline of the shoreline and now we have a satellite view, the topography, but we're still not quite at the GPS level. Taylor Wilson: How does the research actually work here and where do the brains come from? Karen Weintraub: Yeah, so typically brain research is done on people who have passed away and donated their brains to science. In this case, they also used some brain tissue that was donated from living people who had epilepsy surgery or cancer surgery. So they were able to do work on living tissue. And the reason that matters is they can see more of the connections of the circuits that are active so they can better understand what happens in the living brain. Taylor Wilson: What are the implications for disease research on all this? Karen Weintraub: Yeah, so understanding kind of what the different cell types are, and at this really micro level helps them understand which cells are involved in disease and which cells go wrong. So I was talking to a brain cancer researcher and he was saying that they've seen some cells that look like they're kind of trying to build a new brain inside your brain during cancer and other cancer cells that have wound repair programs going that look like they're trying to fix a cut kind of thing. And so these two things are going crazy with these cells simultaneously and understanding that maybe helps develop treatments or it certainly helps researchers better understand what's going on with brain cancer. Taylor Wilson: And another interesting part of this piece to me, Karen, was about the animals. What have we learned here about how our brains compare with other animals? Karen Weintraub: So there were 21 different studies that were part of this package. A couple of them compared our brains to primate brains, other primates, gorillas, chimps, macaques. They found that a lot of the cell types were the same, but the activities were different. So we've got the same hardware, but different software, I guess would be the way to put it. Taylor Wilson: I mean, Karen, there's still a lot we don't know even after this research. What happens next in terms of mapping the brain and this type of research? Karen Weintraub: Right. So now they have sort of a standard by which to compare other brains. So they dove deep into three brains for this. They now need to look at a lot more to better understand individual variation, gender variations. So your brain and my brain are probably different in some fundamental ways, but we don't know what those are yet. And also healthy brains versus different types of brain conditions. Now they can use the \"normal brains\" as kind of the reference brain to compare against these other conditions. Taylor Wilson: All that yet to come. Karen Weintraub covers health for USA Today. Thank you, Karen. Karen Weintraub: Thank you. ♦ Taylor Wilson: Thanks for listening to 5 Things. We're produced by Shannon Rae Green and our executive producer is Laura Beatty.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress was departing Washington on Thursday without a deal to pass wartime support for Ukraine, but Senate negotiators and President  Joe Biden’s  administration were still racing to wrap up a border security compromise to unlock the stalemate before the end of the year. The Senate planned to come back next week in hopes of passing the  $110 billion package of aid  for Ukraine, Israel and other national security and finalizing a deal to place new restrictions on asylum claims at the U.S. border. But the House showed no sign of returning to push the legislation through the full Congress. “We’re working really hard,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said at the end of the day. “It’s not easy, but we’re working hard.” Lawmakers leaving the impasse unresolved through the holidays would mean the Biden administration would have to rely on a dwindling supply of funds for Ukraine. The wartime aid has so far been vital to Ukraine’s defending against Russia’s invasion, but an emboldened Russian President  Vladimir Putin earlier Thursday  recommitted to his goals in the war. \n     \n\n Repelling Russia has been one of Biden’s chief foreign policy goals. But the Democratic president is facing stiff opposition from Republicans in Congress — both from populist conservatives who no longer want to fund the  nearly two-year-old conflict  and GOP senators who have been traditional allies to Ukraine’s defense but insist that the U.S. also enact policies aimed at cutting the historic number of migrants who are arriving at the U.S. border with Mexico. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n             \n                 \n                    RELATED COVERAGE\n                 \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Thousands rally across Slovakia to protest prime minister’s pro-Russia policies \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Biden levies new sanctions against Russian energy sector, but it’s up to Trump whether to keep them \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Kremlin welcomes the possibility of a meeting between Trump and Putin \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Top administration officials, including White House chief of staff Jeff Zients and Biden’s legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff, met with Senate negotiators Thursday evening. Zients had been meeting with Schumer and dropped by to emphasize the president’s call to find policy and funding solutions on the border, according to a White House official. And for a third day Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas holed up with negotiators at the Capitol.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n “We’ll all be back tomorrow,” said one negotiator, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, as the meeting broke for the evening. “A lot to do tomorrow.” \n     \n\n Schumer, a Democrat, rescheduled the Senate to return to Washington on Monday to give negotiators more time to reach the framework of a deal, and he said he would push for a Senate vote on the funding package next week even if an agreement is not in place. In an earlier speech on the Senate floor, Schumer said that the deadlock in Congress has left “Putin mocking our resolve.” He cast the decisions facing lawmakers as a potential turning point of history: “There is too much on the line for Ukraine, for America, for Western democracy, to throw in the towel right now.” But the House ended work and departed for the holidays, with Republican Speaker Mike Johnson showing no sign he will have members return until the second week of January. In fact, Johnson’s office sent around a clip from a Zelenskyy interview suggesting aid could wait until the new year. \n     \n\n Senate Republicans also expressed doubt there was time left this year to both reach an agreement and work through writing the text of legislation, with Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio saying there would be a “revolt” by Republicans if they were forced into a quick vote. A core group of Senate negotiators and Biden administration officials were expected to work through the weekend narrowing a list of priorities aimed at curtailing the number of migrants applying for asylum at the U.S. border. “We are making progress, I feel more confident today than I did yesterday,” Sinema, an Arizona independent who has often been central to Senate deal-making, told The Associated Press. Faced with historic numbers of migrants at the U.S. border with Mexico, the White House has negotiated a change to the law that would allow Homeland Security officials to stop migrants from applying for asylum if the number of total crossings exceeded a certain capacity. Negotiators have also considered several other policies  that resemble those pursued under former President Donald Trump’s administration, including detaining people who claim asylum at the border and granting nationwide authority to quickly remove migrants who have been in the U.S. for less than two years. \n     \n\n Sinema declined to discuss details of the talks but said her aim was to craft a package that has both the policy and funding to “create an orderly, safe, secure and humane process” for seeking asylum or immigrating for “other legal reasons.” She added that negotiators understand they will lose support from wings of both conservatives and progressives, but were aiming to pass the package in the Senate with majorities of both parties. “There will probably be folks on the edges of the political spectrum who are not happy with a solution that secures our border, brings order and is humane,” Sinema said. \n     \n\n In one friction point in talks, the White House has resisted Republican demands to curtail  a humanitarian parole program  that has allowed tens of thousands of migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to enter the U.S., often at ports of entry other than the border, according to several people familiar with the talks who discussed them only on the condition of anonymity. Still, immigration advocates have been dismayed at the White House’s concessions in the talks. Sen. Alex Padilla, the California Democrat who has spearheaded Senate resistance to the plans, said he has told Biden “to be careful because Republicans are hellbent on dragging us into harmful policy territory.” Congress has struggled for decades to find any agreement on border and immigration policy, yet Republicans argue that the Biden administration opened the door for a policy negotiation both by including border-related funding in the national security package and openly calling for Congress to take up reforms. But the complicated and contentious nature of the issue prompted many GOP senators to conclude that there would be no deal for Ukraine aid this year, even as they pledged to prove Putin wrong for doubting U.S. support for Ukraine. “Sometimes democracies take a little more time, but the resolve is real,” said Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D. Some Democrats fretted that leaving the funding deadlock hanging for weeks could precipitate the deal’s collapse. “Actions speak louder than words,” said Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado.",

        "description": "Relatives said the twins had been born some four months ago, about a month into the war which began on October 7.",
        "text": "Born a few weeks into the Gaza war, infant twins Wesam and Naeem Abu Anza were buried on Sunday, the youngest of 14 members of the same family whom Gaza health authorities say were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Rafah overnight. Their mother, Rania Abu Anza, held one of the twins, its tiny body wrapped in a white shroud, to her cheek and stroked its head during the funeral on Sunday. A mourner held the second baby close by, pale blue pyjamas visible beneath a shroud. “My heart is gone,” wept Abu Anza, whose husband was also killed, as mourners comforted her. She resisted when asked to release the body of one of the babies ahead of burial. “Leave her with me,” she said, in a low voice. The twins – a boy and a girl – were among five children killed in the strike on a house in Rafah, according to the health ministry in Gaza. Abu Anza said she had given birth to them – her first children – after 11 years of marriage. \n“We were asleep, we were not shooting and we were not fighting. What is their fault? What is their fault, what is her fault?” Abu Anza said. “How will I continue to live now?” Relatives said the twins had been born some four months ago, about a month into the war which began on Oct. 7, when Hamas stormed Israel, in an attack that killed 1,200 people and resulted in another 253 being abducted, according to Israeli tallies. Israel’s offensive has killed more than 30,000 people in the Gaza Strip since then, according to Gaza health authorities, laying waste to the territory and uprooting most of its population. The members of the Abu Anza family killed in the strike were lined up in black body bags. A man wept over the body of one of the dead, a child wearing pyjamas. “God have mercy on her, God have mercy on her,” said another man, consoling him. Abu Anza said she had been wishing for a ceasefire before Ramadan, the Muslim fasting month which begins around March 10. U.S. President  Joe Biden  has expressed hope one will be agreed by then. “We were preparing for Ramadan, how am I supposed to live my life? How?” she said.

        "description": "Andrzej Duda, whose term expires in 2025, was one of Trump’s preferred international partners during his 2017-21 presidency, and they have described themselves as friends.",
        "text": "Polish President Andrzej Duda discussed  Ukraine  and the  Middle East  with Republican presidential candidate  Donald Trump  during a meeting in New York on Wednesday at which the former U.S. president said he was “behind Poland all the way.” Duda, whose term in office expires in 2025, was one of Trump’s preferred international partners during his 2017-2021 presidency and they have described themselves as friends. In contrast, many other European leaders have long been nervous that a second Trump presidency would mean decreased U.S. support for Poland’s eastern neighbor Ukraine and for the NATO military alliance. “The people of Poland love him (Duda)... and that’s not an easy thing to accomplish, but he’s done a fantastic job and he’s my friend,” Trump told reporters as Duda arrived at Trump Tower. “We’re behind Poland all the way,” he added. The Trump campaign said in a readout of the meeting that they had discussed a proposal from Duda that NATO members spend at least 3% of their gross domestic product (GDP) on defense. The current minimum target is 2%. “They also discussed the war between Russia and Ukraine, the conflict with Israel in the Middle East, and many other topics having to do with getting to world peace,” the campaign said. After their dinner Duda said it was “a friendly meeting in a very nice atmosphere.” Trump, who is on  trial  in New York over accusations that he covered up a “hush money” payment to pornographic actress Stormy Daniels, is likely to face a tight race against President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November presidential election. Duda is in New York to attend the United Nations, and will travel on to Canada on Friday. Reuters Reuters",

        "title": "How Spain and Ireland became the EU’s sharpest critics of Israel",
        "text": "Each time Madrid and Dublin speak out on the war in Gaza others are emboldened to join them, sources say B enjamin Netanyahu’s claim that the Israeli military’s  killing of seven World Central Kitchen aid workers in Gaza on Monday night  was “a tragic incident” did precious little to allay the fears of Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. Nor did his assertion that “this happens in wartime”. Sánchez, who has been one of the most outspoken and persistent European critics of the way in which Israel has prosecuted its war in Gaza after the terrorist atrocities of 7 October, described the Israeli prime minister’s “supposed explanations” as “totally unacceptable and insufficient”. He added that Spain was waiting for a full and detailed account of the killings before deciding “what action we’ll take with regard to the government of Prime Minister Netanyahu”. Sánchez’s latest remarks – along with his announcement on Monday that  Spain  intends to recognise a Palestinian state by July – are a further example of how some of the more habitually taciturn members of the EU have found themselves compelled to speak up amid concerns that the bloc is failing to live up to its moral, political and humanitarian duties. While condemning Hamas’s “shocking acts of terrorism” and acknowledging Israel’s right to defend itself, Sánchez has infuriated Netanyahu’s government by calling the number of dead Palestinians  “truly unbearable” , and emphasising that Israel’s response cannot include  “the deaths of innocent civilians, including thousands of children” . Spain’s socialist prime minister has also said he has “genuine doubts” about whether Israel is complying with international humanitarian law in its offensive in Gaza. In an interview with al-Jazeera on Thursday afternoon, Sánchez said Israel’s actions in Gaza could even lead the EU to debate “whether we continue with this strategic relation or not”. The language from Ireland, which is widely perceived as the most pro-Palestinian voice in the EU,  has been similarly unvarnished . The outgoing taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has described the assault as “approaching revenge”, while the foreign minister, Micheál Martin, has said it was “disproportionate”. Some European diplomats feel history will not look kindly on the EU’s inclination to look the other way on Israel and Gaza when the bloc was all too prepared to call out Russia’s actions in Ukraine. One senior diplomatic source told the Guardian that Spain and Ireland’s strong positions on Palestine were beginning to pay off, adding that each time Madrid and Dublin spoke out, the loneliness of their stance faded and others were emboldened to join them. Both Sánchez and Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, are adamant that the  two-state solution  remains the only answer to the crisis in the Middle East – hence the Spanish government’s urgency in recognising a Palestinian state. “If we look at the medium and long term, if we don’t do something differently to how we have been acting in the last decade, we will see this spiral of violence once again. And in order to do that [something different] … we need a real and valuable Palestinian state,” Albares told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday. “That’s why we are going to recognise the state of Palestine.” Albares also pointed out that the recognition of a Palestinian state had long been a key foreign policy commitment for Sánchez’s Spanish Socialist Worker’s party (PSOE). The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, himself a former Spanish foreign minister, has also made his feelings plain when it comes to Israel’s offensive in  Gaza . “Which are the other solutions they have in mind?”  Borrell said in January . “To make all the Palestinians leave? To kill them? Twenty-five thousand already in Gaza, 70% women and children. Certainly, the way of trying to destroy Hamas is not the way they are doing, because they are seeding the hate for generations.” Dublin has been seeking to make common cause with like-minded members and has calibrated its statements to nudge, but not subvert, the EU foreign policy mainstream. As well as teaming up with Spain, Slovenia and Malta last month to express a readiness to recognise Palestinian statehood, it has partnered with Spain to prod the EU into reviewing an Israel trade deal over human rights obligations. Last week Ireland announced it would intervene in South Africa’s landmark international court of justice case against Israel by attempting to widen the definition of genocide to include blocking aid. Sign up to  This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “Clearly an entire population is being impacted here not just through the bombing but through starvation,” Martin, told the Guardian. “We’ve experienced famine, we know what it’s like in our psyche,” he said, citing the 1840s disaster known as the Great Hunger. Martin linked Dublin’s response to the devastation in Gaza with an Irish foreign policy tradition of seeking to curb certain weapons, such as cluster munitions, and promoting humanitarian corridors in Syria, Ethiopia and other conflicts. Martin said he expected Ireland’s foreign policy to remain unchanged under Simon Harris, who is due to succeed Varadkar as taoiseach next week. “We’ve worked with Simon Harris for the last four years in government, so we don’t anticipate any major issues around the content of foreign policy,” he said. Irish diplomats and analysts say Ireland’s colonial history has predisposed it to back the underdog. It was the first EU state to endorse Palestinian statehood in 1980. Even so, Ireland strives to remain within the EU consensus, said Niall Holohan, who served as Ireland’s representative to the Palestinian Authority from 2002 to 2006. Israel has accused Dublin of giving succour to Hamas, whose 7 October attack on southern Israel triggered the war, but domestically the Irish government has faced accusations of being too soft on Israel. Opposition parties have pushed for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador and proposed a law that would ban the Irish state from investing in companies that operate in illegal Israeli settlements, moves the government has resisted. Sánchez’s erstwhile allies in the far-left Podemos party  have also been forthright in their condemnation , accusing Israel of planning a “genocide” against the Palestinian people and calling for Netanyahu to be brought before the international criminal court to face war crimes charges. As European and international exasperation increases, some diplomats blame the continued division in the bloc on the early unconditional support for Israel given by the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, arguing it would not be at odds if she had clearly mentioned Israel’s obligation to observe human rights in her initial support of the country’s right to defend itself. Six months on, waiting for a change in the status quo is simply no longer an option for many. “If we wait for the 27 member states [to recognise Palestine] we will be waiting for ever,” said one senior diplomat.",

As colleges nationwide grapple with claims of antisemitism and activism among students and faculty, a Yale University professor argued that educational institutions must return to a position of neutrality so freedom of expression can thrive.         \n        \n       \"I think one of the things that the recent controversies in the Mid East have pointed out is, once you start down that road weighing in on various issues … it's hard to know when to stop,\" Professor Rick Antle said. \"And you're always concerned about the shadow that casts over the culture internally about freedom of expression.\"  The accounting professor was among over 100 staff members who joined the \"Faculty for Yale\" initiative launched in December 2023, a group committed to rededicating themselves to the university's fundamental mission to \"preserve, produce, and transmit knowledge,\"  according to its website . The group was founded in response to a \"number of challenges\" presented at the university, including increased bureaucracy and  threats to free speech .

The  faculty coalition  has shared a list of commitments, including to prioritize \"teaching, learning and research as distinct from advocacy and activism\" and to promote free expression paired with \"institutional neutrality,\" according to the website. The move follows major criticism over antisemitic incidents and  suppressed free speech on college campuses , particularly following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the resulting war, which has led to several hostile situations at universities.      Yale University is one of many campuses across the country that has faced protests over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the Middle East since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack.    (Left: Photographer: Craig Warga/Bloomberg via Getty Images, Center: Photo by Erica Denhoff/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) AS ANTISEMITISM INFILTRATES COLLEGE CAMPUSES, THIS FREE-SPEECH FOCUSED SCHOOL EXPECTS A FLOOD OF APPLICANTS     \n        \n       \"We want to have a good culture where people are courteous and don't go out of their way to offend other people … but we also want to have cultures where people feel free to express themselves,\" Antle said. \"If the institution's position means that certain views are discouraged and so forth, I think that's tricky.\" Many universities have faced fallout from  both students and donors  for their statements — or prolonged or lack of statements — on Hamas' attack and Israel's response. How the  colleges handled the fallout , in many cases, led to even more issues.     \"I think about educational neutrality. That's very important,\" Antle said. \"At an institution like Yale, it should be neutral.\" LECTURER AT UMASS AMHERST SPARS WITH PRO-ISRAEL STUDENT   Video         \n        \n       FREE SPEECH CONTROVERSIES ERUPT ON TODAY'S COLLEGE CAMPUSES Yale President Peter Salovey  released a statement  on Oct. 10 condemning the attack on Israel and promoting respectful, open-dialogue about the conflict. He also released several statements rejecting hateful and discriminatory incidents toward all students, but some students were dissatisfied with the university leader's responses. In November, hundreds of Yale students and community members gathered to protest, accusing the university of failing to highlight injustices against Palestinians,  Yale Daily News  reported. A pro-Palestinian student group, Yalies4Palestine,  called on the university  to take a stand against Israel bombarding Gaza and accused the school of supporting genocide of Palestinians.         \n        \n       \"Antisemitism, Islamophobia and hatred toward Palestinians and Israelis are emphatically against our values and principles at Yale,\" Salovey said in  November . \"Let me also be clear in stating that our forceful rejection of discrimination and prejudice must be matched by our will to act with compassion and civility.\"     Protests have erupted at college campuses nationwide since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.    (Photo by Williams Paul/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) ‘DESPICABLE’: STUDENTS CONDEMN HARVARD STUDENT GROUPS' LETTER BLAMING ISRAELIS FOR OWN MASSACRE \"We are a community of many viewpoints, identities, and cultures,\" he said. \"We do not agree with one another on everything.

        "description": "Israel has submitted to mediators its reservations about a Hamas proposal for a hostage release deal, the official said.",
        "text": "Israeli forces bombarded areas of Rafah on Thursday, Palestinian residents said, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed US President Joe Biden’s threat to withhold weapons from Israel if it assaults the southern Gaza city. A senior Israeli official said late on Thursday that the latest round of indirect negotiations in Cairo to halt hostilities in Gaza had ended and Israel would proceed with its operation in Rafah and other parts of the Gaza Strip as planned. \nIsrael has submitted to mediators its reservations about a Hamas proposal for a hostage release deal, the official said. “If we must, we shall fight with our fingernails,” Netanyahu said in a video statement. “But we have much more than our fingernails.” In Gaza, Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad said their fighters fired anti-tank rockets and mortars at Israeli tanks massed on the eastern outskirts of the city. Residents and medics in Rafah, the biggest urban area in Gaza not yet overrun by Israeli ground forces, said an Israeli attack near a mosque killed at least three people and wounded others in the eastern Brazil neighbourhood. Video footage from the scene showed the minaret lying in the rubble and two bodies wrapped in blankets. An Israeli air strike on two houses in the Sabra neighbourhood of Rafah killed at least 12 people including women and children. Among the dead was a senior commander of the militant Al-Mujahedeen Brigades, and his family, and the family of another group leader, medics, relatives and the group said. Israel says Hamas militants are hiding in Rafah, where the population has been swelled by hundreds of thousands of Gazans seeking refuge from the bombardments that have reduced most of the coastal enclave to ruins. In the United States, the White House repeated its hope that Israel would not launch a full operation in Rafah, saying it did not believe that would advance Israel’s aim of defeating Hamas. “Smashing into Rafah, in [President Biden’s] view, will not advance that objective,” spokesperson John Kirby said. Kirby said Hamas had been pressured significantly by Israel and there were better options to hunt down what remains of the group’s leadership than an operation with significant risk to civilians. Israel’s assault on Gaza has killed nearly 35,000 Palestinians and wounded nearly 80,000, most of them civilians, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said. It launched its offensive in response to a cross-border attack by Hamas militants on Israel on Oct. 7 in which they killed about 1,200 people and abducted 252. Some 128 hostages remain in Gaza and 36 have been declared dead, according to the latest Israeli figures. Biden on Wednesday issued his starkest warning yet against a full ground invasion in Rafah, telling CNN that: “I made it clear that if they go into Rafah…I’m not supplying the weapons.” Israel’s ambassador to the United States said the decision to withhold weapons from Israel over Rafah sends the “wrong message” to Hamas and the country’s foes. “It puts us in a corner because we have to deal with Rafah one way or the other,” Ambassador Michael Herzog told a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace webinar. The Israeli military has the munitions it requires for operations in Rafah and other planned operations, chief armed forces spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said. Israeli armed forces have already killed 50 Palestinian gunmen in east Rafah and uncovered several tunnels, Hagari said. Hamas had no immediate comment. In Cairo, delegations from Hamas, Israel, the US, Egypt and Qatar had been meeting since Tuesday. The talks in Egypt’s capital made some headway but no deal was reached, according to two Egyptian security sources. Izzat El-Risheq, a member of Hamas’ political office in Qatar, said the Hamas delegation had left Cairo, having reaffirmed its approval of the mediators’ ceasefire proposal. The plan entails the release of Israeli hostages held captive in Gaza and a number of Palestinians jailed by Israel. Hamas blamed Israel for the lack of agreement so far. Israel has said it is open to a truce, but has rejected demands for an end to the war. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington continued to engage with Israel on amendments to a ceasefire proposal, adding work to finalize the text of an agreement was “incredibly difficult”. Israeli residents set fire twice to the perimeter of the headquarters of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees in East Jerusalem, causing extensive damage to the outdoor areas but no casualties, UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini wrote on X. There was no immediate comment from Israeli police. “Once again, the lives of U.N. staff were at a serious risk,” Lazzarini wrote, adding he had decided to close the compound until security is restored. On Tuesday, Israeli tanks seized the Gaza side of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, cutting off a vital aid route and forcing 80,000 people to flee the city this week, according to the United Nations. Israel kept up tank and aerial strikes across Gaza and tanks advanced in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City in the north, forcing hundreds of families to flee, residents said. The Israeli military said it was securing Zeitoun, starting with a series of intelligence-based aerial strikes on approximately 25 militant targets. Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza was packed with people who had fled Rafah in recent days. Palestinian medics said two people, including a woman, were killed when a drone fired a missile at a group of people there. The closure of the Rafah crossing with Egypt has prevented the evacuation of the wounded and sick and the entry of medical supplies, food trucks and fuel needed to operate hospitals, the Gaza health ministry said on Thursday. The only kidney dialysis centre in the Rafah area had stopped operating due to the shelling. “The entire medical sector has collapsed,” said Ali Abu Khurma, a Jordanian surgeon volunteering at Al Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah. United Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths said that for three consecutive days, “nothing and no one has been allowed in or out of Gaza.” “It means no aid. Our supplies are stuck. Our teams are stuck. Civilians in Gaza are being starved and killed, and we are prevented from helping them. This is Gaza today, even after 7 months of horrors,” Griffiths posted on X.

        "text": "Médecins sans Frontières/ Doctors Without Borders (MSF)—is horrified by the killing of two MSF doctors, Dr Mahmoud Abu Nujaila and Dr Ahmad Al Sahar, and a third doctor working with Al Awda, Dr Ziad Al-Tatari, following a strike on Al Awda Hospital, one of the last remaining functional hospitals in northern Gaza. In a statement, Sana Beg, Director of Communications for MSF South Asia, said, “The health system in Gaza has collapsed. Most hospitals are out of service as electricity and water have been cut due to lack of fuel. Healthcare facilities have suffered extensive damage in attacks. The wounded and sick are being denied their basic right to access medical care safely and with dignity. Medical staff working in Gaza, even though utterly exhausted, are doing what they can in impossible conditions.They should not have to choose between saving their own lives and those of patients.” Beg also said that medical personnel, health facilities and ambulances need to be protected and hospitals must remain a sanctuary for people seeking care. Dr Abu Nujaila and Dr Al Sahar were in the facility when it was hit on the third and fourth floors. Other medical staff, including MSF staff, were also severely injured.  More than 200 patients still in Al Awda must be urgently evacuated to other functioning hospitals.  “Seeing doctors killed next to hospital beds is beyond tragic, and this must stop now,” as per the statement.

        "description": "Four U.S. Army boats, loaded with tons of equipment and steel pier segments, left Virginia on Tuesday, heading to Gaza as part of the U.S. effort to expand the delivery of food and other supplies to starving Palestinians as Israel's war against Hamas drags on.",
        "text": "WASHINGTON: Four U.S. Army boats, loaded with tons of equipment and steel pier segments, left Virginia on Tuesday, heading to Gaza as part of the U.S. effort to expand the delivery of food and other supplies to starving Palestinians as Israel’s war against Hamas drags on. The ships pulled out of docks at Joint Base Langley-Eustis and headed down the James River toward the Atlantic Ocean for what could be a month-long voyage to the Mediterranean Sea. There, at a yet-to-be-announced location along the Gaza shore, they will build and begin to operate a floating dock to receive the aid. Since Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Israel’s military has battered the territory, killing more than 30,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and creating a humanitarian catastrophe. The U.N. says virtually all of Gaza’s 2.3 million people are struggling to find food. But getting humanitarian aid to the area has been difficult, due to the ongoing hostilities and struggles to coordinate with the Israeli military, which has blocked routes and slowed deliveries due to inspections. The latest Pentagon plan calls for the U.S. military to build what is called a modular causeway system. Off shore, the Army will build a large floating platform where ships can unload large containers of aid. Then the aid will be transferred by the Army to a motorized string of steel causeway sections that have been pushed to the shore. That pier is expected to be as much as 1,800 feet (550 meters) long, with two lanes, and the Pentagon has said it could accommodate the delivery of more than 2 million meals a day for Gaza residents. Officials have not said who will be unloading the containers and taking the aid ashore. President Joe Biden has said there will be no U.S. troops on the ground in Gaza. On Tuesday, as family members and senior Army commanders watched, about 70 soldiers with the 7th Transportation Brigade (Expeditionary) pulled away from the docks in four U.S. Army vessels: the USAV Wilson Wharf, USAV Matamoros and USAV Monterrey, all Army landing crafts, and the larger USAV SP4 James A. Loux, a logistics support watercraft. The brigade’s commander, Army Col. Sam Miller, said about 500 of his soldiers will participate in the mission. All together, Pentagon officials have said about 1,000 U.S. troops will be involved. Calling it a complicated mission, Miller said the transit will take about a month, but it will depend on weather and any possible high seas. The actual construction, he said, will take about a week, but that also could be hampered by weather. Then it will take additional time to get the delivery process coordinated with those providing the aid and the system up and running. Defense officials have said it will take about two months to get the deliveries started. The Army’s vessels and maritime capabilities are unique and not as well known as the Navy’s. The last time the 7th Transportation Brigade did a similar mission to construct a large pier was in Haiti in 2010. But it has participated in a number of major military exercises. “The soldiers here are energized, they’re motivated, they’re excited,\" Miller said, adding that the new humanitarian mission “gives them purpose and meaning\" and highlights the Army’s watercraft. He noted that just 36 hours after Biden ordered the operation, the first Army vessel — the USAV General Frank S. Besson logistics ship — left Joint Base Langley-Eustis on Saturday. Miller said a larger Maritime Sealift Command ship will also be leaving Virginia in the coming days, and will be carrying some of the bigger equipment and more of the steel pier segments.

        "description": "Some protesters burned the US flag and said they associate themselves with Hamas.",
        "text": "US Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday condemned the “despicable\" and “unpatriotic\" burning of an American flag by protesters who rallied in Washington during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress. “I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way,\" the Democratic presidential candidate said in an unusually strong statement. She said Wednesday’s demonstration featured “despicable acts by unpatriotic protestors and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric.\" The statement, echoed by other senior Democrats, came amid attempts by Republicans to paint the party as pro-Hamas. “Anti-American and pro-Hamas rioters burned the American flag in front of the US Capitol, and the woman who wants to be our president is still refusing to condemn it,\" Senator J.D. Vance, who is running for vice president alongside Donald Trump, wrote on social media just before Harris’s statement was issued. Thousands of demonstrators angry over the war in Gaza marched on the heavily guarded US Capitol on Wednesday as Netanyahu delivered an uncompromising speech to lawmakers. A group of protesters gathered outside a train station near the Capitol, where they spray-painted monuments, burned Netanyahu in effigy, and lit American flags on fire — a raucous end to a mostly peaceful march. Harris, who launched her presidential campaign immediately after President Joe Biden announced a shock exit from his reelection bid on Sunday, was set to meet Netanyahu later Thursday. The Israeli leader will meet separately with Biden. The White House has struggled to thread the political needle in maintaining traditional support for Israel during its offensive in Gaza, which has been heavily condemned by left-leaning voters in the United States.",

        "description": "",
        "text": "Something has shifted in  Donald Trump 's pursuit of the  White House  in 2024. That's  the view  of Harris Faulkner,  Fox News ' daytime anchor who is in New Hampshire closely following the candidates she knows well.  The veteran broadcaster, who is well-sourced among the  DeSantis , Haley and Trump camps, told DailyMail.com that ‘something has changed with Trump in the last few weeks, he’s much less self-focused and fighting like it's 2016 again.’ ‘You hear him say “Make America Great Again” over and over and over, like 2016,’ Faulkner explained from  New Hampshire , where she predicts  Nikki Haley  and Ron DeSantis will need to close Trump's lead significantly in the upcoming primary to continue with their campaigns.  ‘What he's tapping into with the electorate is this feeling of “we feel everything around us is crumbling, we want the guy who will fight on behalf of us, hear us when we speak and fix the things that we say are broken\"' she explained.  Faulkner also explained how Biden's 'disastrous' record on the southern border as heightened tensions in the Middle East, including  Israel  and Yemen, make national security a key issue for voters heading to the polls.              Harris Faulkner, Fox News ' daytime anchor claims something has shifted in Donald Trump             The veteran broadcaster, who is well-sourced among the DeSantis , Haley and Trump camps, says issues at the border will influence the election  It comes as Trump swept to victory in Monday’s  Iowa  Republican caucuses, hoovering up more than 50 percent of the vote, leaving  Florida  Governor Ron DeSantis just 21 percent and Nicki Haley 19 percent. Speaking to voters in New Hampshire Faulkner says they tell her that in order to consider a candidate other than Trump they would need someone ‘outside that bubble of politics’ and ‘different enough to get our attention and they ask \"can that person eat into Trump's lead?\"’  ‘We just learned so much about the intensity of feeling and potentially the intensity of the whole country,’ Faulkner told DailyMail.com.  ‘But we certainly learned it about early primary goers and caucus goers in the early rounds. We learned that no weather can stop them!’ Voters turned out despite the icy weather, which is promising for candidates considering New Hampshire is forecast snow and temperatures in the 30s during the critical vote next Tuesday. Faulkner hasn’t written Haley off entirely, and doesn’t agree that she or DeSantis would need to take the New Hampshire vote out right. However, she believes they would have to close the gap far more than in Iowa to be considered a viable challenger to the former president moving forward.  ‘I haven't seen voters throw in the towel over the 50 percent, but if it isn’t even close like in Iowa then that would be tough for anybody to rise after New Hampshire’ she explained.             Trump swept to victory in Monday’s Iowa Republican caucuses, hoovering up more than 50 percent of the vote             Faulkner hasn’t written Haley off entirely, and doesn’t agree that she or DeSantis would need to take the New Hampshire vote out right In assessing the mood among voters Faulkner cited a recent poll that found only 4 percent of Americans believe the country is working for them.  Her reporting has led her to the conclusion that Biden’s well-documented issues at the Southern border are a large factor in this disillusionment ahead of the election later this year.  ‘The complete disaster that we have on our southern border is a top three issue for voters’ she explained. ‘It's disastrous for the people who were coming in illegally and for the people who are trying to come in legally' she explained. 'Those coming in legally are getting pushed to the back of the lines because the cartels are manipulating and killing and spending the kind of money they need to win the war of getting more drugs into our country.’  ‘On the other side of that are the American citizens who are trapped, we can't go anywhere else.  'This is our country, and if our sovereignty is melting away, because our border is being trampled.’ Faulkner is also concerned that the Biden administration is not paying enough attention to the northern border. ‘They are dealing with some of these issues on the northern border too. ‘It matters because you don’t want a situation where you're so focused on one, that terrorists come across the other.’ In a recent discussion on Fox News Texas congressman Pat Fallon told Faulkner that Biden's failure to designate the Yemeni Houthi's as the most severe terror threat left America open to attacks on home soil.     75 percent of Americans now consider the nation’s southern border issues a 'crisis' or a 'very serious' problem, according to the latest polling. Those who feel the situation at the border is a 'crisis' is on the rise from the spring, when just 38 percent called it a 'crisis' in May compared to the 45 percent who now feel the same. Reports emerged earlier this month showing that the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is on track this month to process the most migrants in the agency's history with more than 304,000 encounters in a single month. ‘If your border is porous, and you don't have firm national security, and you're engaged around the world where people want to kill you’ Faulkner said, citing America’s support of Israel in their war against Hamas. ‘You make it easier for them to access your home soil' she warned.",

The likes of U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken,  Chinese Premier Li Qiang , EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and many others will descend on the Alpine ski resort town of Davos on Jan. 15-19, organizers said Tuesday. Attendees have their work cut out for them with two major wars — the  Israel-Hamas conflict  and  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  — plus problems like  climate change , major  disruptions to trade in the Red Sea , a weak global economy and  misinformation  powered by rapidly advancing artificial intelligence in a major election year.  \n     \n\n Trust has eroded on peace and security, with global cooperation down since 2016 and plummeting since 2020, forum President Borge Brende said at a briefing. “In Davos, we will make sure that we bring together the right people to see how can we also end this very challenging world, look at opportunities to cooperate,” he said. \n\n Brende noted that there are fears about  escalation of the conflict in Gaza  and that key stakeholders — including the prime ministers of Qatar, Lebanon and Jordan as well as Herzog — were coming to Davos to “look how to avoid a further deterioration and also what is next, because we also have to inject some silver linings.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Zelenskyy will give an address next week during the event, while more than 70 national security advisers from around the world will gather in Davos on Sunday to discuss ways forward on Zelenskyy’s peace plan, Brende said. It’s the  fourth such meeting , but Russian officials have never participated. \n     \n\n Major figures — including U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan,  new Argentina President Javier Milei ,  OpenAI CEO Sam Altman ,  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella  — will discuss big ideas in hundreds of public sessions and speeches or in other talks surrounding the event.  There’s also more secretive backroom deal-making in the upscale hotels along Davos’ Promenade, near the conference center that hosts the gathering. How much all these discussions will result in big announcements is uncertain. The World Economic Forum’s glitzy event has drawn criticism for being a place where high-profile figures talk about big ideas but make little headway on finding solutions to the world’s biggest challenges.  It’s also been criticized for hosting wealthy executives who sometimes fly in on  emissions-spewing corporate jets . ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the World Economic Forum meeting at  https://apnews.com/hub/world-economic-forum .",

        "title": "Middle East crisis: UN’s expert on torture investigating claims Palestinian detainees were mistreated in Israel – as it happened",
        "text": "UN special rapporteur on torture to carry out fact-finding investigation after receiving allegations detained Palestinians were mistreated The  UN ’s expert on torture said on Friday she was investigating allegations of torture and mistreatment of  Palestinian  detainees in  Israel , and was in talks to visit the country, reports Reuters. Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the UN human rights council in  Geneva ,  Dr Alice Jill Edwards  said she had recently received allegations of torture and ill-treatment of Palestinians being detained in the Israeli-occupied  West Bank  or as a result of the conflict in  Gaza , where Israel is fighting the ruling Palestinian  Hamas  movement. “I’m looking into that as we speak and carrying out a fact-finding investigation,” said Edwards, the UN special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. “I’m calling on … Hamas, the state of Palestine, Israel to put their torture tools down, to really have a focus on peace and a prospect of living side-by-side as neighbours in the future,” she told Reuters. Reuters said there was no immediate comment from the Israeli diplomatic mission in Geneva. The UN human rights office says it has received numerous reports of mass detention, ill-treatment and enforced disappearance of Palestinians in northern Gaza by the Israeli military, and has recorded the arrests of thousands in the West Bank. Edwards said she had also raised allegations of mass murders and mutilations of hostages and sexual violence against them with Palestinian authorities through the Palestinian Permanent Mission in Geneva. She said she had, however, received “a disappointing reply” that “showed no empathy for those individuals who were subject to terrible atrocities on 7 October”. The mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Reuters. It has gone 5pm in  Gaza  and Tel Aviv. We will be closing this blog soon, but you can stay up to date on the Guardian’s Middle East coverage  here . Here is a recap of the latest developments from today: The European Commission, Cyprus, the UAE, UK and US put out a joint statement on what it described as the activation of a maritime corridor to deliver humanitarian assistance to Gaza.  “This maritime corridor can – and must – be part of a sustained effort to increase the flow of humanitarian aid and commercial commodities into Gaza through all possible routes,” it added. It is believed that the maiden aid voyage will be made by Spain’s Open Arms in what will be a test voyage of the sea corridor.  The vessel had been waiting at Cyprus’s port of Larnaca for permission to deliver food aid from World Central Kitchen, a US charity founded by celebrity chef José André. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said she expected the maritime aid corridor to start operating between Cyprus and Gaza over this weekend , taking desperately needed aid to besieged Palestinians. Von der Leyen said a pilot test run of food aid collected by a charity group and supported by the UAE could be leaving Cyprus as early as Friday from the port of Larnaca. Von der Leyen held talks with the president of Cyprus, Nikos Christodoulides, on Friday.  The EU chief travelled to Larnaca to inspect the command centre and port facilities that will be used. US forces will build a temporary dock on the  Gaza  shoreline to allow delivery of humanitarian aid on a large scale, president Joe Biden announced in his  State of the Union speech , amid warnings of a widespread famine among the territory’s 2.3 million Palestinians. He promised “no US boots will be on the ground”, and said: “This temporary pier would enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into  Gaza  every day.” Biden also warned  Israel  that it cannot use aid as a “bargaining chip”  as he issued a call for an immediate, temporary ceasefire with Hamas. “To the leadership of Israel I say this – humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority,” Biden said in his annual State of the Union address. Sigrid Kaag, the UN senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, told reporters late on Thursday that air and sea deliveries cannot make up for a shortage of supply routes on land.  Kaag said that while airdrops represented a “symbol of support for civilians in Gaza” and were “a testament to our shared humanity”, they were “a drop in the ocean”. “It’s far from enough,” she added. Aid groups have welcomed Biden’s announcement of relief finally reaching the war-ravaged coastal strip. But there are also fears that with needs now so desperate any shipment will be “a drop in the bucket.”  Reacting to the news Mercy Corps’ vice-president of global policy and advocacy, Kate Phillips-Barrasso said that while “any effort to get more aid into Gaza is needed and welcome” any ‘sea aid’ would be “a drop in the bucket in terms of the volume and range of relief Palestinians need right now.” The UK foreign secretary David Cameron said on Friday that the US-led plan to build a temporary harbour in Gaza to bring in aid would take time, reiterating his call for Israel to open the port of Ashdod in the meantime . He said it was “crucial” for the Israelis to “confirm that they’ll open the port”. Cameron also urged Israel to allow more aid trucks into Gaza. The UN’s expert on torture said on Friday she was investigating allegations of torture and mistreatment of Palestinian detainees in Israel , and was in talks to visit the country. Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the UN human rights council in Geneva, Dr Alice Jill Edwards said she had recently received allegations of torture and ill-treatment of Palestinians being detained in the Israeli-occupied West Bank or as a result of the conflict in Gaza. Edwards said she had also raised allegations of mass murders and mutilations of hostages and sexual violence against them with Palestinian authorities  through the Palestinian Permanent Mission in Geneva. She said she had, however, received “a disappointing reply” that “showed no empathy for those individuals who were subject to terrible atrocities on 7 October”. The mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Reuters. Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories have expanded by a record amount   and risk eliminating any practical possibly of a Palestinian state, the UN human rights chief said on Friday.  The UN’s high commissioner for human rights Volker Türk said that the growth of Israeli settlements amounted to the transfer by  Israel  of its own population, which he said was a war crime. At least 30,878 Palestinians have been killed and 72,402 have been injured since 7 October   in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza , the Hamas-run health ministry said in a statement on Friday. “On average, 63 women are killed in Gaza per day” said the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA)  in a social media post for International Women’s Day. According to UNRWA,  at least 9,000 women have been killed in Gaza since early October , but the UN agency warned the number is likely higher due to the many more reported to be dead under the rubble. Israel will not give in to international pressure to stall an attack on the southern Gaza city of Rafah and will continue its bloody offensive against Hamas, said  Benjamin Netanyahu .  “There is international pressure and it’s growing, but … we need to stand together against the attempts to stop the war,” the prime minister told a military graduation ceremony in southern  Israel . Israel’s army said on Friday its initial probe into an incident that the Palestinian health authorities said left more than 100 Palestinians dead as crowds rushed an aid convoy, found troops “fired precisely” at approaching suspects.  Releasing its initial findings on Friday, the military said in a statement that the “command review” found that “troops did not fire at the humanitarian convoy”. It added, however, that they “did fire at a number of suspects who approached the nearby forces and posed a threat to them”. UK support for the marine aid corridor to Gaza has involved assistance with planning and surveying , Downing Street said. A Number 10 spokesperson said: “We have supported the US in planning for the pontoon, including by sending marine surveyors and will now be working with partners to operationalise our maritime aid corridor from Cyprus.” The UK’s foreign secretary David Cameron said on Friday: “Alongside the US, the UK and partners have announced we will open a maritime corridor to deliver aid directly to Gaza”. The UN’s human rights office said on Friday that an Israeli offensive in Gaza’s border town of Rafah could not be allowed to happen because it would cause massive loss of life.  “Any ground assault on Rafah would incur massive loss of life and would heighten the risk of further atrocity crimes,” said Jeremy Laurence, spokesperson for the UN human rights office. A Hamas official told AFP that ceasefire negotiations were not over, on Friday.  “The mediators informed Hamas that efforts will continue to reach an agreement,” the official told AFP, requesting not to be named as he was not authorised to speak on the matter. Israeli war cabinet member Gadi Eisenkot said Hamas was under “very serious pressure” from mediators to make a “counter-offer”. British maritime agencies said on Friday an incident had been reported in waters about 50 nautical miles south-east of Yemen’s city of Aden  where Houthi militants have been attacking ships. Two civilians were killed in a Turkish airstrike in the mountainous Sheladiz area in northern Iraq’s Duhok province , two security sources said on Friday. Reuters reports that British maritime agencies said on Friday an incident had been reported in waters about 50 nautical miles south-east of  Yemen ’s city of  Aden  where  Houthi  militants have been attacking ships. The  Iran -backed group has launched drone and missile attacks on shipping in the  Red Sea ,  Bab al-Mandab strait  and  Gulf of Aden  since November. They say they are acting in solidarity with  Palestinians  over the war in  Gaza . The  United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO)  said that the authorities are investigating the incident while security firm Ambrey said it is aware of an incident nearly 52 nautical miles south of Aden and is also investigating. UKMTO WARNING INCIDENT 047 ATTACK Warnings - 2024 ( https://t.co/5An1YH0JyE ) #MaritimeSecurity   #MarSec   pic.twitter.com/a5Xz8KIeGa The  UK  foreign secretary David Cameron said on Friday that the  US -led plan to build a temporary harbour in  Gaza  to bring in aid would take time, reiterating his call for  Israel  to open the  port of Ashdod  in the meantime, reports Reuters. “It’s going to take time to build,” Cameron told UK broadcasters of the harbour. “So the crucial thing is today the Israelis must confirm that they’ll open the port at Ashdod.” The  UN ’s expert on torture said on Friday she was investigating allegations of torture and mistreatment of  Palestinian  detainees in  Israel , and was in talks to visit the country, reports Reuters. Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the UN human rights council in  Geneva ,  Dr Alice Jill Edwards  said she had recently received allegations of torture and ill-treatment of Palestinians being detained in the Israeli-occupied  West Bank  or as a result of the conflict in  Gaza , where Israel is fighting the ruling Palestinian  Hamas  movement. “I’m looking into that as we speak and carrying out a fact-finding investigation,” said Edwards, the UN special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. “I’m calling on … Hamas, the state of Palestine, Israel to put their torture tools down, to really have a focus on peace and a prospect of living side-by-side as neighbours in the future,” she told Reuters. Reuters said there was no immediate comment from the Israeli diplomatic mission in Geneva. The UN human rights office says it has received numerous reports of mass detention, ill-treatment and enforced disappearance of Palestinians in northern Gaza by the Israeli military, and has recorded the arrests of thousands in the West Bank. Edwards said she had also raised allegations of mass murders and mutilations of hostages and sexual violence against them with Palestinian authorities through the Palestinian Permanent Mission in Geneva. She said she had, however, received “a disappointing reply” that “showed no empathy for those individuals who were subject to terrible atrocities on 7 October”. The mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Reuters. We now have the  statement  endorsing what it describes as the activation of a maritime corridor to deliver humanitarian assistance to Gaza. The statement has been put out jointly by the European Commission, Cyprus, the United Arab Emirates, the UK and the United States: The humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire, with innocent Palestinian families and children desperate for basic necessities. That is why today, the European Commission, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, the Republic of Cyprus, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, and the US announce our intent to open a maritime corridor to deliver much-needed additional amounts of humanitarian assistance by sea. Cyprus’s leadership in establishing the Amalthea Initiative-which outlines a mechanism for securely shipping aid from Cyprus to Gaza via sea-was integral to enabling this joint effort to launch a maritime corridor. Together, our nations intend to build on this model to deliver significant additional aid by sea, working in coordination with UN senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza Sigrid Kaag – who is charged with facilitating, coordinating, monitoring, and verifying the flow of aid into Gaza under UN security council resolution 2720. The dedicated efforts of the UAE to mobilise support for the Initiative will result in the initial shipment of food by sea to the people of Gaza.” Cyprus, it continued, “will soon convene senior officials to discuss how we can accelerate this maritime channel supporting those in need, supplementing land and air routes, including from Egypt and Jordan. The US announced an emergency mission led by the  US military  to establish a temporary pier in Gaza, in coordination with humanitarian partners and other countries, to enable the delivery of significant quantities of assistance by sea. These efforts will be closely coordinated with the government of Israel.” But the statement also predicted that the delivery of humanitarian assistance directly to  Gaza  by sea would be complex, necessitating nations to continue “to assess and adjust our efforts to ensure we deliver aid as effectively as possible.” “This maritime corridor can – and must – be part of a sustained effort to increase the flow of humanitarian aid and commercial commodities into Gaza through all possible routes,” it added. “We will continue to work with  Israel  to expand deliveries by land, insisting that it facilitate more routes and open additional crossings to get more aid to more people. We affirm that protecting civilian lives is a key element of international humanitarian law that must be respected. And together, we must all do more to ensure aid gets to people who desperately need it.” Here are some more of the latest images from the newswires: UK  support for the marine aid corridor to  Gaza  has involved assistance with planning and surveying, Downing Street has said, according to the Press Association (PA). A Number 10 spokesperson said: We will and have been supporting it. We have supported the US in planning for the pontoon, including by sending marine surveyors and will now be working with partners to operationalise our maritime aid corridor from Cyprus. We continue to be very clear that we need to go much further, not enough aid is getting into Gaza, and we continue to push them to take further action, to do more to protect civilians, to abide by international humanitarian law and allow more aid in and to protect foreign aid workers and to facilitate humanitarian operations. We continue to impress the importance of this in our conversations and as you’ve seen today we are also taking action with our allies to get more vital aid in.” UK involvement in the maritime corridor is not expected to involve a deployment of British personnel to Gaza, added the PA. Israel ’s army said on Friday its initial probe into an incident that the Palestinian health authorities said left more than 100  Palestinians  dead as crowds rushed an aid convoy, found troops “fired precisely” at approaching suspects, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). World leaders had called for an investigation into the incident on 29 February when the health ministry in the  Hamas -run  Gaza Strip  said Israeli forces opened fire on people scrambling for food from a truck convoy. The Israeli military said at the time that a “stampede” occurred when thousands of people surrounded the convoy. Releasing its initial findings on Friday, the military said in a statement that the “command review” found that “troops did not fire at the humanitarian convoy”. It added, however, that they “did fire at a number of suspects who approached the nearby forces and posed a threat to them”. The health ministry in Gaza, in an updated toll issued on Friday, said 120 people were killed in the 29 February incident and at least 750 others were injured. It has previously alleged they were shot by Israeli forces. Witnesses said thousands of people had rushed towards aid trucks in  Gaza City  early that morning, and that soldiers “fired at the crowd as people came too close to the tanks.” A  UN  team that visited Gaza City’s  al-Shifa hospital  the day after the incident reported seeing “a large number of gunshot wounds” among dozens of Palestinian patients. In its statement on Friday, the military said about 12,000 Palestinians had gathered around the aid trucks and began taking the supplies, reports AFP. “During the course of the looting, incidents of significant harm to civilians occurred from the stampede and people being run over by the trucks,” the army said. At that time, “dozens of Gazans advanced towards nearby IDF troops, up to several metres from them, and thereby posed a real threat to the forces at that point,” it said. The military said troops “fired cautionary fire in order to distance the suspects,” and after they continued to advance, “the troops fired precisely toward a number of suspects to remove the threat.” A  Hamas  official told AFP that ceasefire negotiations were not over, on Friday. “The mediators informed Hamas that efforts will continue to reach an agreement,” the official told AFP, requesting not to be named as he was not authorised to speak on the matter. Israeli  war cabinet member  Gadi Eisenkot  said Hamas was under “very serious pressure” from mediators to make a “counter-offer”. “Then it will be possible to advance it and take a position,” he said. US  president  Joe Biden  had urged Hamas to accept a ceasefire plan with Israel before Ramadan, but Hamas negotiators left talks with mediators in  Egypt  to consult with the movement’s leadership in  Qatar . According to AFP, Hamas’s delegation voiced dissatisfaction with Israeli responses so far before leaving  Cairo , although US ambassador to Israel  Jack Lew  denied the talks had “broken down”. We are hearing that the maiden aid voyage will be made by Spain’s Open Arms in what will be a test voyage of the sea corridor. The vessel had been waiting at Cyprus’s port of Larnaca for permission to deliver food aid from World Central Kitchen, a US charity founded by celebrity chef José André. The Guardian has learned that a joint statement by the EU, US, UK, Cyprus and the United Arab Emirates will detail how the aid operation will work. Earlier this week a source familiar with the matter divulged that aid was being coordinated with the UAE. Speaking from Nicosia, one western diplomat told us: “The facilities at the port are ready and the aim is to get the first shipment out before Sunday.” Aid groups have welcomed US president Joe Biden’s announcement of relief finally reaching the war-ravaged coastal strip. But there are also fears that with needs now so desperate any shipment will be “a drop in the bucket.” Reacting to the news Mercy Corps’ vice-president of global policy and advocacy, Kate Phillips-Barrasso said this morning: Any effort to get more aid into Gaza is needed and welcome as the entire population faces crisis levels of hunger and the abyss of famine. However, any ‘sea aid’ will be a drop in the bucket in terms of the volume and range of relief Palestinians need right now. While inspection and logistics details are still unclear, any aid moving through this route would still be subject to many, if not all, the same impediments, delays, and bureaucratic obstacles we’re facing getting aid in through land crossings. And even if a seaport enables more aid into Gaza, once it arrives there is still no way to effectively distribute at the scale needed or to the people who are most urgently facing starvation absent a ceasefire. The Biden administration is rightly focused on getting more lifesaving assistance to Palestinians trapped in Gaza – but ad hoc, time-consuming, and unsustainable workarounds like airdrops and offshore deliveries further underscore that the US is not adequately using its leverage with Israel to end the siege that is driving humanitarian needs or to enable increased, safe, and sustainable access for aid and aid workers in a meaningful way.” Sigrid Kaag , the  UN  senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for  Gaza , told reporters late on Thursday that air and sea deliveries cannot make up for a shortage of supply routes on land. Speaking on the diversification of aid supply routes,  after addressing the UN security council , Kaag told reporters that land remained the “optimal solution”. “It’s easier, it’s faster, it’s cheaper – particularly if we know we need to sustain humanitarian assistance to Gazans for a long period of time – and, of course, I’ve spoken to the importance of opening additional crossings,” she said. Kaag said that while airdrops represented a “symbol of support for civilians in Gaza” and were “a testament to our shared humanity”, they were “a drop in the ocean”. “It’s far from enough,” she added. Kaag commended the government of  Cyprus  for, what she called “their foresight and inclusive planning” on a maritime corridor to Gaza. She said: In recent days you will have heard, and will hear more today or tomorrow, on a number of big countries joining and accelerating – or almost, I’d say, fast forwarding the establishment of a maritime corridor with a focus on humanitarian goods – and I think this is really important.” However, she pointed out that delivering aid by air and sea could not to make up for a shortage of aid supply routes on land: “Air or sea is not a substitute for what we need to see arrive at land.” Kaag also spoke about other considerations regarding aid for Gaza: “Humanitarian assistance, and I’ve mentioned this before, is not an exercise in counting trucks. We need to know quality, relevance, it meets the needs, and as I said, volume.” European Commission  president  Ursula von der Leyen  said she expected a maritime aid corridor to start operating between  Cyprus  and  Gaza  over this weekend, taking desperately needed aid to besieged  Palestinians . According to Reuters, von der Leyen said a pilot test run of food aid collected by a charity group and supported by the  United Arab Emirates  could be leaving Cyprus as early as Friday from the  port of Larnaca  in Cyprus. The  UK  said it would work alongside the  US  to open a maritime corridor to deliver aid directly to  Gaza , the UK’s foreign secretary  David   Cameron  said on Friday. “Alongside the US, the UK and partners have announced we will open a maritime corridor to deliver aid directly to Gaza,” Cameron said on social media. “We continue to urge  Israel  to allow more trucks into Gaza as the fastest way to get aid to those who need it,” he added. People in Gaza are in desperate humanitarian need.   Alongside the US, the UK and partners have announced we will open a maritime corridor to deliver aid directly to Gaza.   We continue to urge Israel to allow more trucks into Gaza as the fastest way to get aid to those who need… The  UN ’s human rights office said on Friday that an  Israeli  offensive in  Gaza ’s border town of  Rafah  could not be allowed to happen because it would cause massive loss of life, reports Reuters. “Should Israel launch its threatened military offensive into Rafah, where 1.5 million people have been displaced in deplorable, subhuman conditions, any ground assault on Rafah would incur massive loss of life and would heighten the risk of further atrocity crimes,” said  Jeremy Laurence , spokesperson for the UN human rights office. “This must not be allowed to happen,” he said. Here are some of the latest images on the newswires: Over in Cyprus, EU Commission president Ursula Von der Leyen is holding talks with local leader Nikos Christodoulides in the latest fine-tuning of plans to create a maritime corridor from the east Mediterranean island to  Gaza . The EU chief, who arrived in the country last night, will travel from Nicosia, its capital, to Larnaca to inspect the command centre and port facilities that will be used to ship desperately needed aid to the besieged coastal strip a mere 210 nautical miles away. Speaking to the state-run CyBC radio this morning the government spokesperson, Konstantinos Letymbiotis said an announcement on how the operation would work would be issued later today. “The presence of von der Leyen alone in Cyprus sends messages as to the progress of the Cypriot initiative,” he said. Nicosia first proposed establishing an humanitarian maritime corridor to Gaza in October but the scheme is believed to have come up against the opposition of  Israel  which has repeatedly expressed concerns over the potential of Hamas to hide weapons among the aid shipments. Israeli agents would inspect supplies, expected to include food and medicines, both at the Cypriot port and once they were transferred on to ships. The EU’s most easterly member state, Cyprus has good relations with Israel and the Arab world. Christodoulides has said the initiative highlights the strategic island’s ability to be “a bridge to the region.” Officials have hinted that the first shipment could happen as early as Sunday, the expected start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.",

        "description": "More than 700 people have been killed in Israel since Hamas launched its attack on Saturday, while on the Gaza side, at least 560 people have been killed",
        "text": "Israel Air Force on Monday launched intensive airstrikes in the Gaza Strip as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to “change the Middle East\" in war with Palestine-based militant group Hamas. A video shared by Netanyahu on X, formerly Twitter, showed a building turned into rubbles after airstrike. Sharing the video, he wrote, “We started. Israel will win.\" More than 700 people have been killed in Israel since Hamas launched its attack on Saturday, while on the Gaza side, at least 560 people have been killed. “What Hamas will experience will be difficult and terrible… we are going to change the Middle East,\" Netanyahu told officials visiting Jerusalem from the country’s south, where Hamas militants carried out a surprise attack on Saturday morning. “This is only the beginning… we are all with you and we will defeat them with force, enormous force.\" Hamas militants stormed towns and communities in southern Israel at dawn on Saturday under the cover of a barrage of rocket fire, in the deadliest attack on the country in decades. Israel has ordered an “immediate\" cut to water supplied to the Gaza Strip, the energy minister said. “I ordered to immediately cut off the water supply from Israel to Gaza. Electricity and fuel were cut off yesterday,\" he said in a post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. Katz’s order came soon after Defence Minister Yoav Gallant ordered a “complete siege\" on the Gaza Strip, which receives about 10 percent of its annual water from Israel. Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline and monitors who and what goods are allowed in and out through its border crossings. Earlier today, Gallant said Israel is “putting a complete siege on Gaza.\" “No electricity, no food, no water, no gas — it’s all closed,\" Gallant said in a video message, referring to the enclave that is overcrowded with 2.3 million people. On Sunday, Israeli authorities announced that they would cut off the supply of electricity, fuel and goods to Gaza in the wake of the deadliest day of violence in nearly 50 years. This decision was taken by the country’s Security Cabinet, which informed the Israeli forces have begin the offensive phase to restore the security of their citizens. (With inputs from AFP)",

        "text": "Rishi Sunak  has condemned “in the strongest terms” Iran’s “reckless attack” against  Israel  after  Tehran  said it had launched dozens of drones in what threatens to become a major regional escalation. The  Prime Minister  said the UK will “continue to stand up for Israel’s security and that of all our regional partners” as reports in Israel suggested RAF and US warplanes had shot down some Israel-bound drones over the Iraq-Syria border area. Officials in Jerusalem said the drones, which Iraqi security sources said were seen flying over the country, would take hours to reach their targets. It brings the two archenemies to the brink of all-out conflict as decade-old tensions in the Middle East remain inflamed over the war in Gaza, with the US vowing to back Israel. Iran  had been threatening to attack since an air strike, which it blamed on Israel, last week killed two Iranian generals in Syria. {\"data\":{\"id\":\"1779266507404399014\"}} Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has not commented on that attack. According to reports, RAF Typhoons from Akrotiri, Cyprus, have been deployed to help protect Israel. In a statement on Saturday night, Mr Sunak said: “I condemn in the strongest terms the Iranian regime’s reckless attack against Israel. “These strikes risk inflaming tensions and destabilising the region. {\"data\":{\"id\":\"1779256852057874718\"}} “Iran has once again demonstrated that it is intent on sowing chaos in its own backyard. “The UK will continue to stand up for Israel’s security and that of all our regional partners, including Jordan and Iraq. “Alongside our allies, we are urgently working to stabilise the situation and prevent further escalation. No-one wants to see more bloodshed.” Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer condemned the “unacceptable attacks”. In a statement, he said: “We condemn the Iranian regime’s decision to subject Israelis to these unacceptable attacks. “The international community has been united in urging restraint and we regret that yet again Iran has chosen a different, dangerous path. {\"data\":{\"id\":\"1779266317532475699\"}} “Our thoughts are with all those in the region who want peace and security, not the fear and instability being generated by Iran. “We continue to stand up for Israel’s security and that of our other partners in the region, including Jordan and Iraq. We support all measures designed to restore calm as we must do all we can to prevent a wider regional war.” US President Joe Biden has pledged to stand with Israel against Iran, the White House said. Tehran has largely avoided directly attacking Israel, despite its targeted killings of nuclear scientists and sabotage campaigns on Iran’s atomic sites, instead targeting Israeli or Jewish-linked sites through proxy forces. But it vowed retaliation for what it said was an Israeli strike on its Damascus consulate on April 1.",

        "title": "The Senate is pushing past far-right objections to aiding Ukraine. But next steps are uncertain",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Senate is plodding past far-right Republican opposition to helping  Ukraine fight Russia , working through the weekend on a $95.3 billion military aid package for Kyiv,  Israel  and other allies that could be President Joe Biden’s last chance for now to deliver substantial American support. Senators conducted a late-night vote Friday, advancing to next steps as they spin through objections from a core group of Republicans. More closely aligned with  Donald Trump , the GOP’s presidential front-runner, the Republican senators aren’t putting a priority on stopping Russian President  Vladimir Putin’s  invasion.  Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told the senators he would be willing to amend the package to win over more support, but the New York Democrat also warned they would stay in session “until the job is done.” Even if the foreign aid package gets off the ground in the Senate with possible Sunday voting, the package still faces a deeply uncertain future in the House. In that chamber, the Republican majority is even more hostile to helping the U.S. ally in Europe, as the war enters its second year. \n     \n\n Attendance slipped Friday night as senators advanced the bill, 64-19, with 14 Republicans joining Democrats to move it forward. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n             \n                 \n                    RELATED COVERAGE\n                 \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 UK Treasury chief heading to China to revive suspended economic and financial talks \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 State-run Pakistan International Airlines resumes direct flights to Europe after EU lifts ban \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 European Investment Bank to boost funds for Bangladesh as it weathers political turmoil \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Overall,  the bill  includes $14.1 billion in military aid for Israel for the war with Hamas, $8 billion for Taiwan and partners in the Indo-Pacific to counter China, and $9.2 billion in  humanitarian assistance for Gaza , among other provisions. It had stalled out for weeks, but is on track toward passage in the days ahead after a separate U.S. border security deal collapsed when Republicans rejected it. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Central to the package has always been the military aid for Ukraine, whose President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has personally visited Congress to plead for help, including in a whirlwind trip last December, as he tries to preserve his country. \n     \n\n Amid  shortages on the battlefield , the package would unleash $60 billion for Ukraine, mostly to purchase U.S.-made defense equipment, including munitions and air defense systems that authorities say it desperately needs as Russia batters the country. It includes $8 billion for the government in Kyiv and other assistance. Biden, speaking with the German chancellor on Friday at the White House, said it would be  “close to criminal neglect”  if the U.S. Congress fails to stand by its European ally.  “The failure of the United States Congress, if it occurs, not to support Ukraine, is close to criminal neglect,” Biden said. “It is outrageous.” German Chancellor  Olaf Scholz  said: “Without the support of United States, and without the support of the European states, Ukraine will have not a chance to defend its own country.” The resistance from the Republicans to helping Ukraine has been an intensifying but also stunning about-face for the party that once defined itself on a muscular foreign policy. In the Trump era, the GOP has latched on to a more isolationist approach, echoing his “America First” agenda with a more ambivalent attitude toward Putin’s aggression. \n     \n\n In a  key vote Thursday , 17 Republican senators agreed to start debate on the bill — but 31 voted against it. “Our job first and foremost is to protect this country,” Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, a leading opponent, said during a Friday night speech. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who has been critical of Biden’s handling of Ukraine and other national security issues, is nevertheless pushing past the isolationists in his party to marshal the national security package to passage. McConnell has visited Zelenskyy in Kyiv and hosted the leader at the Capitol, and the Republican leader has tried to impress on his party the importance of investing in allies — and replenishing the U.S. industrial base that manufactures the weaponry being used to push back Russia. “This is about rebuilding the arsenal of democracy and demonstrating to our allies and adversaries alike that we’re serious about exercising American strength,” McConnell said. \n     \n\n During Friday night’s floor debate, Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska, who served in the military as a Marine, emphasized most of the money goes “to build weapons, to build ammo” in states all across the U.S. with what he said would be thousands of American jobs. “This is a generational investment in our ability to defend ourselves,” Sullivan said. Senators groused that at least one Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, was forcing the time-consuming procedural steps as often happens to register opposition. To draw in political support, the Senate leaders stripped out some economic assistance for Ukraine that many Republican senators objected to, leaving that to allies in the European Union, who  overcame  their own political opposition last week to approve an aid package. Bundling the U.S. package with aid to Israel and Indo-Pacific allies has won over some Republicans, but has also drawn concerns from some Democrats as the humanitarian destruction in Gaza by Israeli forces deepens. \n     \n\n Panic hit  the Gazan city of Rafah as Israel announced a planned evacuation of what is expected to be its next target in the four-month war that started with attacks by Hamas. An estimated 1.5 million people are sheltering there, more than half of Gaza’s population. “I cannot find words,” Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont, said during a speech Friday. Sanders said much of the U.S. money for Israel would allow Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “buy more of the bombs he has used to flatten Gaza and killed thousands and thousands of children.” “This is American complicity at its worse and it’s really quite unbelievable,” Sanders said. “Does the United States Congress really want to provide more military aid to Netanyahu so that he can annihilate thousands and thousands more men, women and children?”  Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and other Democrats announced they  had secured  a national security memorandum with the Biden administration to ensure the U.S. assistance is used in accordance to international and humanitarian law.  The Senate is not expected to take votes Saturday, but senators, who are on the brink of a two-week recess away from Washington, are expected back midday Sunday, ahead of the Super Bowl, to push the package toward final votes. The package would go to the House next, but Speaker Mike Johnson has not indicated if, or when, he would schedule any votes on it.",

        "text": "Over 105,000 people march against antisemitism in London   Over 105,000 people marched in solidarity in London on Sunday, against antisemitism.   A town council in East London is ‘pausing’ the planned installation of the Hanukkah menorah outside the Havering Town Hall this year, calling it a \"difficult\" decision.          \n        \n       The London Borough of Havering announced  in a statement  on Thursday that the installation of the menorah has been delayed to avoid \"possible vandalism or other action\" against the city council and local residents.  \"We appreciate this is a hugely sensitive issue, but in light of escalating tensions from the conflict in the Middle East, installing the candelabra now will not be without risk to the Council, our partners, staff and local residents. We would also be concerned with any possible vandalism or other action against the installation,\" Havering Council wrote in a statement.     The London Borough of Havering has previously erected a menorah outside town hall in recognition of Hanukkah.   (iStock)     It explained, \"The Council has taken the difficult decision to pause the planned installation of the Chanukah Menorah outside Havering Town Hall this year… There will still be a temporary installation and event to celebrate the beginning of Hanukkah. This will be taken down after the event and we will look at a longer-term installation next year.\"      \n        \n       But, the statement added, \"Due to an increase in the number of hate crimes in Havering, both towards the Jewish and Muslim communities and after consulting with the Leader of the Council, we believe it would be unwise to move forward with the installation, which could risk further inflaming tensions within our communities.\"     HAMAS TERROR CHIEF EXPOSED AS LIVING IN LONDON PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECT, FUNDED BY UK TAXPAYERS: REPORT The statement follows the Community Security Trust (CST) reporting that there have been 1,124 reported antisemitic incidents from Oct. 7 to Nov. 7, the largest number of incidents to occur within a month since the organization began keeping records in 1984.     \n        \n       Since the  Hamas terror attac k against Israel in October, there have also  been massive pro-Palestinian  and pro-Israel demonstrations.      Havering Council released a statement confirming that the installation of a menorah has been canceled.   (Getty Images) \"When we started work on the installation no one could have foreseen the recent international events,\" the council acknowledged.     Local rabbis and political leaders have criticized the decision, but the council maintained this was not done as an  act of antisemitism .         \n        \n       \"Sadly, some are politicising this and making accusations of anti-Semitism. This is categorically untrue and such statements are likely to incite further unrest in our communities. The council flew the Israeli flag in solidarity following the heinous terrorist attack against the people of Israel and we continue to stand by our local Jewish communities,\" the statement read.

(Photo by Leila Dougan/Gallo Images via Getty Images) Nevertheless, Romford Rabbi Lee Sunderland told Havering Daily, \"This is an opportunity to stand up to the hostility that would silence Judaism or any form of diversity and celebrate it to its fullest. This may be a Jewish festival, but it is a lesson for the whole world and for every generation. Most especially, please let us celebrate this in public and begin to bring the citizens of Havering together now.\"         \n        \n       Editors note: This story has been updated to clarify that while the installation of the Hanukkah menorah will not go forward as originally planned, a \"a temporary installation and event to celebrate the beginning of Hanukkah\" will be put up and then quickly taken down at the conclusion of the event.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP     Lindsay Kornick is an associate editor for Fox News Digital.

        "text": "Former President Donald Trump delivered his  usual assortment of long-debunked false claims  in an appearance on Fox News in Pennsylvania on Wednesday night. But one of the false claims was new.\n     \n            Trump, who has repeatedly  insulted the intelligence  of his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, claimed that Harris used speaking notes to assist her in her  interview with CNN anchor Dana Bash last week .\n     \n            Trump said: “If you watch that that interview, she had notes. That means she knew the questions. And she had notes. She kept looking down – ‘uhhh.’ Nobody wants to cover it.” He continued, “I know all about notes. I mean, you know, it’s all right if people know that. But she wasn’t supposed to have notes.”\n     \n             Facts First :  Trump’s claims are false. Harris did not use notes during the CNN interview.  Photos  and  videos  of the interview make clear that the only notes on the table belonged to Bash, as CNN staffers who were present confirm .  And CNN did not inform Harris of any questions in advance; a CNN spokesperson called Trump’s claim that Harris had prior knowledge of the questions “categorically false.” \n     \n            Here are some of the other false claims Trump made at the Fox News event on Wednesday.\n     \n             Terror during Trump’s presidency : Trump repeated his previous false claim that there were “no” terror attacks by Islamic extremists during his presidency.\n     \n            Trump’s own Justice Department  alleged  that a mass murder in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was a terrorist attack carried out  in support of ISIS ; Trump  repeatedly lamented  this attack during his presidency. Trump’s Justice Department also  alleged  that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was  carried out  by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n     \n            You can read more  here .\n     \n             Iran during Trump’s presidency : Trump repeated his previous false claim that Iran was so “broke” during his presidency that “they didn’t have the money for Hamas and for Hezbollah, they didn’t have the money for anybody.” Iran’s funding for Hamas, Hezbollah and other terror groups  continued throughout his presidency, as Trump’s own administration acknowledged in 2020 , though experts say Iran did make funding cuts when its economy was squeezed by Trump sanctions.\n     \n            You can read more  here .\n     \n             Trump’s tax cuts : Trump repeated his previous false claim that “I gave you the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country.” His major 2017 tax cut was not the biggest in history either in percentage of gross domestic product or inflation-adjusted dollars.\n     \n            You can read more  here .\n     \n             Harris’ immigration role : Trump repeated his previous false claims that Harris was “border czar” and “in charge” of the border. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is the official in charge of border security; President Joe Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment in 2021, asking her to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala and Hondurasin an attempt to address the “root causes” that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States.\n     \n            You can read more  here ,\n     \n             Migrants and mental health facilities : Trump repeated his previous false claim that foreign countries are “emptying out their prisons and jails, they’re emptying out their mental institutions and insane asylums” so people can travel to the US as migrants.  His own campaign has been unable to substantiate such claims , and experts say they have seen no evidence for them.",

        "text": "Families of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and Gazan civilians seeking respite from the  incessant Israeli airstrikes  were left disappointed on Wednesday after the White House dismissed a report by the  Washington Post  that claimed citing people familiar with the developments that a Israel and Hamas agreed to a deal brokered by the US to free hostages by allowing a five day pause in the war. 2023 Israel-Hamas War: Full Coverage The deal, if agreed upon, would bring respite to the aforementioned parties as Israeli families of hostages increase pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure the release of hostages. It would also buy enough time for the international community, UN organisations and multilateral forums to  assess the damage in Gaza . Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in response to the October 7 attacks, which Israeli officials say killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and saw about 240 people taken hostage. The army’s relentless air and ground campaign has since killed 12,300 people, more than 5,000 of them children, according to the Hamas government which has ruled Gaza since 2007.",

        "text": "A second pro-Palestine rally in  Sydney  is unlikely to go ahead after Premier Chris Minns said organisers had already shown they were not peaceful. A widely-condemned rally was held on Monday night as the  NSW  government lit the Opera House in the blue and white of the  Israeli  flag in solidarity with victims of this week's terrorist attacks. More than 1000 people are dead after the Islamist group  Hamas  attacked Israeli towns from the Palestinian territories on Saturday.             There is unlikely to be a second pro-Palestine protest in Sydney following the wild scenes at the Opera House on Monday (pictured above)             The widely-condemned rally was held after the NSW government lit the Opera House in the blue and white of the Israeli flag in solidarity with terrorism victims             Premier Chris Minns said protest organisers had already shown they were not peaceful Among them was Sydney grandmother Galit Carbone, who was executed at the Be'eri kibbutz, kilometres from the Gaza Strip. Opera House rally organisers from the  Palestine  Action Group have defended their right to protest in Australia, saying media coverage had focused on a tiny fringe of 'vile anti-Semitic attendees'. Mostly young teens shouting 'f** the Jews' and other racial slurs were quickly condemned and asked to leave, the group said in a statement issued on Tuesday. Mr Minns said he took 'full responsibility' for the protest and promised it would not happen again, despite organisers planning another rally for the weekend. 'The protest organisers have already proven that they're not peaceful: shouting racial epithets at Jewish community members is not the definition of a peaceful protest,' he told reporters on Wednesday. 'So the idea that they're going to commandeer Sydney streets is not going to happen and I'm sure NSW Police will make that clear this morning.' More than 1000 people attended a pro-Palestine rally outside the Victorian State Library on Tuesday evening. Reports from Victoria Police indicated there were no major incidents or arrests amid a strong police presence. A vigil for Israeli victims of the attacks is due to be held in Sydney's eastern suburbs on Wednesday evening.",

        "description": "",
        "text": "President  Joe Biden  has told a group of  Democratic  donors on Tuesday that he might not have decided to stand for re-election at 81 years of age if former president  Donald Trump  wasn’t seeking to reclaim the presidency in next year’s general election. Mr Biden, the oldest person to ever serve as America’s chief executive, is looking to be elected to serve another four-year term in the  White House , which would end when he is 86 years old. He announced his candidacy for re-election in April, approximately six months after Mr Trump launched his campaign for the Republican Party’s 2024 presidential nomination against the man he lost to three years ago.  The 46th president’s advanced age has led a small number of Democrats to call for him to stand aside in favour of a younger, presumably more vigorous candidate who, in his critics’ telling, would easily best Mr Trump. But while speaking at a fundraiser outside Boston on Tuesday, Mr Biden said Mr Trump’s persistence on the political scene is why he is not stepping aside in favour of a new generation. “If Trump wasn’t running, I’m not sure I’d be running. But we cannot let him win,” he said.  Mr Biden currently trails his twice-impeached, indicted predecessor in most opinion polls, with key voting blocs from his winning 2020 coalition dropping their support for him amid his strong backing of Israel during its’ two-month-old war against Hamas.",

        "description": "The reports included 200 with information useful to investigators, police said.",
        "text": "Reports to a UK police counter-terrorism hotline have more than doubled since the  Hamas  attack on  Israel . Police  said that between October 7 and 25 the anti-terror hotline received around 1,350 reports, more than twice the number of contacts compared to the same period last year. The number of reports with information useful to investigators went up by nearly four times to 200. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said: “Sadly, history tells us that events overseas can inspire or accelerate acts of violence much closer to home. We are working day and night with our partners to monitor the threat picture. “We’re acutely aware of the energising effect the conflict could have on those with extremist or terrorist intent. “With that in mind, our Counter Terrorism Units across the country are reviewing their casework and checking that operational police activity is as effective as it can be to keep people safe. “Critical to this work is the support of the public. As the increase in the number of reports to Counter Terrorism Policing in the last month shows, there is a real willingness from our communities to tell us about their concerns. “To those who have contacted police, thank you, your information can have a huge impact on what we do.” The national counter-terrorism squad that monitors material online has also seen a rise in referrals, with nearly 2,000 made by the public since October 7. Of these more than 350 have been found to require further investigation to see if the content breaks terrorism laws. Police are urging members of the public and businesses to remain alert to the risk of possible terrorist activity over Christmas and the New Year. Mr Taylor added: “The coming months are filled with brilliant events and activities, where people will be coming together to enjoy the festive season. “Sadly, we have seen before that terrorists can view these as attractive targets. “Whilst we are working incredibly hard, with our partners, to make sure you can enjoy this time of year safely – our message is simple, stay alert and trust your instincts. “Whether you’re a business, an event organiser, a local authority or simply heading out with family and friends, if you see something that doesn’t feel right, please report it. “You won’t be wasting our time and you could save lives.” Reports of suspicious activity related to terrorism can be made online at gov.uk/ACT or by calling 0800 789 321.",

        "description": "The Archbishop of Canterbury outlined his ideas during a House of Lords debate on the situation in Sudan.",
        "text": "A major defence review should prepare the UK to “wage peace” to help save lives, taxpayers’ cash and control migration, according to the  Archbishop  of  Canterbury . The Most Rev  Justin Welby  said the new Government’s root and branch review needs to develop a “peace-building option”, alongside preparedness for war, in a bid to stop conflict before it happens. He explained this could enable the UK to extend its influence, protect its interests and “guard against fresh waves of migration”. I already hear anecdotally from within the diocese I serve and its south coast that those who are meeting those landing in boats find a very high proportion indeed are coming from Sudan The Archbishop of Canterbury Speaking during a debate on  Sudan , Mr Welby said he had heard reports from those meeting small boats crossing the Channel of a “very high proportion” of people arriving from the war-torn African country. Sudan descended into conflict in April 2023 after months of worsening tensions turned into open fighting between rival factions, including the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), seeking control of the country. Mr Welby described Sudan as a “human catastrophe on an extraordinary scale” and said the use of “vast quantities” of humanitarian aid only results in temporary solutions. He acknowledged the “hard work” of the  Foreign Office  in response to Sudan, before highlighting the UK Government’s desire for a return to democratic civilian-rule. Mr Welby told the Lords: “But as we’ve seen elsewhere, peace with an authoritarian government is better than no peace at all, and I hope that is not so much of a red line that we will not work to establish the ceasefire and the stability which will enable civilians to take over.” Mr Welby raised the need to “wage peace” and highlighted the strategic defence review (SDR) as an “important and welcome opportunity” to build a new “pillar” in the way the UK structures its defence and security operations. The strategic defence review should be full spectrum, preparing this nation not only to wage war but to wage peace as well The Archbishop of Canterbury  He said: “It was a pillar notably absent from the two integrated reviews. A peace-building option, well developed and acting in areas of fragility, would extend our influence, protect our interests and, as has been said several times, guard against fresh waves of migration. “I already hear anecdotally from within the diocese I serve and its south coast, that of Canterbury, that those who are meeting those landing in boats find a very high proportion indeed are coming from Sudan.” Mr Welby suggested the UK needs to invest longer-term in “broader reconciliation resources”, saying: “Specifically designed with partners to find peaceful solutions. “In other words, the SDR should be full spectrum, preparing this nation not only to wage war but to wage peace as well. I fear that may not be the case.” Mr Welby said he hopes the Foreign Office will look “very carefully” at putting such mechanisms in place, adding: “Not least, in our current times in this country, for reasons of economy. “Stopping conflict before it happens via peaceful, political solutions should be central to any security and defence root and branch redesign.” {\"data\":{\"id\":\"1834507902125555982\"}} Mr Welby pointed to the UK’s “enormous” influence and expertise in sub-Saharan Africa, adding: “The work of peacebuilding not only saves lives, it saves vast amounts of taxpayers’ money for defence, for migration control and from humanitarian aid. “It can be used expertly in contexts where our military would never operate in force, and rightly, and yet where strategic foreign policy must work, such as in the context of securing critical minerals for the global transition to renewable energy, like the DRC (Democratic Republic of the Congo). “Reducing the need for emergency funding, reducing destruction and reducing the dangers of vastly increased immigration are in our interests.” Mr Welby said the Foreign Office’s “negotiation and peace process support team” is “underfunded” and “understaffed”, as he proposed creating a broader joint reconciliation unit. Opening the debate, Foreign Office minister Lord Collins of Highbury warned the “world is not paying enough attention” to Sudan. He said: “Sudan is facing a manmade famine and one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. The UN estimates that more than 24 million people - about half the Sudanese population - need humanitarian assistance, a figure, sadly, that continues to grow as the conflict drags on Lord Collins of Highbury “More than 10 million people have been forced to leave their homes, and recent widespread flooding has pushed the country to the brink, devastating an extremely fragile ecosystem. “The UN estimates that more than 24 million people – about half the Sudanese population – need humanitarian assistance, a figure, sadly, that continues to grow as the conflict drags on.” Lord Collins said the UK has increased its humanitarian support to Sudan and sanctions have been imposed on key figures linked to both sides of the conflict. He added: “Turning to peacebuilding, the United Kingdom supports the establishment of a civilian-led government in Sudan. This country’s future must not include those who have led it into turmoil.” Lord Collins went on to condemn “atrocities” being committed in Sudan, saying: “Some attacks by the RSF and its allied militia appear to have been ethnically motivated, and these bear all the hallmarks of ethnic cleansing. “Meanwhile, the SAF have launched indiscriminate air strikes in heavily populated areas, with no regard for civilian casualties.” Conservative former minister Baroness Anelay of St Johns said Sudan “threatens to be deadlier” than either conflict in Gaza and Ukraine.",

        "title": "Joe Biden issues strident defence of refusal to call for ceasefire in Gaza",
        "text": "US president argues Hamas has said it will not stop attacking Israel, and says he is ‘mildly hopeful’ of hostage deal Joe Biden has presented an unapologetic defence of his refusal to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, arguing that Hamas represents a continuing threat to Israel and that Israeli forces were seeking to avoid civilian casualties. After a summit meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the Apec summit in San Francisco, Biden told reporters on Wednesday night that Hamas had pledged to continue its attacks on  Israel . Biden also argued that Israeli forces had switched from aerial bombardment, which he seemed to acknowledge had been indiscriminate in parts, to more targeted ground operations, after more than 11,000 Palestinians are reported to have died. He said: “It is not carpet bombing. This is a different thing. They’re going through these tunnels, they’re going into the hospital. They’re also bringing in incubators or bringing in other means to help people in the hospital, and they’ve given, I’m told, the doctors and nurses and personnel the opportunity to get out of harm’s way. So this is a different story than I believe it was occurring before, the indiscriminate bombing.” Biden added: “The IDF … acknowledge they have an obligation to use as much caution as they can in going after their targets. It’s not like they’re rushing to the hospital knocking on doors, you know, pulling people aside and shooting people indiscriminately.” Biden repeated a claim he made last month that babies had been beheaded in the  Hamas  attack. “Hamas has already said publicly that they plan on attacking Israel again like they did before, cutting babies’ heads off, burning women and children alive,” he said. “So the idea that they’re going to just stop and not do anything is not realistic.” The White House clarified last month that US officials had not seen evidence of this and that Biden was referring to news reports. It was not immediately clear if new intelligence had emerged confirming such actions. Reports that Hamas beheaded babies in the 7 October attack on Israeli civilians remain unconfirmed but the brutality of the massacre in which about 1,200 people were killed is not in doubt. The Israeli military made the claim in the first few days after 7 October. Biden also suggested that a possible hostage deal was imminent, saying the Israelis had agreed to a “pause” as part of the deal, but then stopped short, appearing to acknowledge the uneasiness of the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, finally adding: “I’m mildly hopeful.” On Thursday morning, the IDF said Israeli fighter jets had struck the house of the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in  Gaza . In a social media post that included a video said to show the strike, the IDF said the home “was used as terrorist infrastructure and a meeting point for Hamas’s senior leaders to direct terrorist attacks against Israel”. Israeli police said on Thursday that they had shot and “neutralised” a suspect in a shooting attack at the Tunnels checkpoint between Jerusalem and Bethlehem, adding that large forces were deployed to the scene. Israeli forces dropped leaflets warning Palestinians to flee parts of southern Gaza, residents told the Associated Press on Thursday, signalling a possible expansion of operations to areas where hundreds of thousands of people who heeded earlier evacuation orders are crowded. The leaflets, dropped in areas east of the southern town of Khan Younis, warned civilians to evacuate the area and said anyone in the vicinity of militants or their positions “is putting his life in danger”. Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said on Wednesday that the ground operation would eventually “include both the north and south. We will strike Hamas wherever it is.” The UN security council backed a resolution on Wednesday calling for “ urgent extended humanitarian pauses  for [a] sufficient number of days to allow aid access” into Gaza. The resolution, the first to be adopted after four previous failures, calls for humanitarian corridors across the Gaza Strip and urges the release of all hostages held by Hamas. The US and the UK, two potentially veto-wielding powers, abstained on the grounds that although they supported the emphasis on humanitarian relief, they could not give their full support because it contained no explicit criticism of Hamas. It is the first UN resolution on the Israel-Palestine conflict since 2016. In an address to the security council in effect announcing that Israel would not abide by the resolution, Gilad Erdan, Israel’s ambassador to the UN, said: “This council has just adopted a resolution that is regretfully detached from the reality on the ground. This council … still has not succeeded in condemning Hamas’s 7 October massacre. The resolution focuses solely on the humanitarian situation in Gaza [and] makes no mention of what led up to this moment. “Israel does not need a resolution to remind us to adhere to international law. Israel always adheres to international law. Bringing our hostages home is Israel’s top priority. Israel will continue to do whatever it takes to accomplish this goal.” UN resolutions are in theory legally binding but are widely ignored, and the political significance lies in the US’s willingness to back a call for an extended humanitarian ceasefire. The resolution came amid condemnation of Israel’s decision to send troops into al-Shifa hospital in Gaza, marking an escalation of Israel’s offensive against Hamas. “Hospitals are not battlegrounds,” said the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “We’ve lost touch again with health personnel at the hospital. We’re extremely worried for their and their patients’ safety.” Late on Wednesday, the IDF released a video that it said showed some of the material recovered from a building in the large hospital complex, including automatic weapons, grenades, ammunition and flak jackets. Lt Col Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesperson, said in the video: “These weapons have absolutely no business being inside a hospital.” Hamas denied the claim, which it said was “nothing but a continuation of the lies and cheap propaganda through which [Israel] is trying to give justification for its crime aimed at destroying the health sector in Gaza”. On Wednesday evening, the chief Israeli military spokesperson, R Adm Daniel Hagari, said troops had found weapons, combat gear and technological equipment at al-Shifa, and were continuing their search of the complex. Israel has so far presented in public only limited evidence in support of its claim that a command complex lies under al-Shifa. It is widely accepted that Hamas has an extensive tunnel network across Gaza. Additional reporting by Emine Sinmaz and Jason Burke in Jerusalem, and Patrick Wintour",

        "title": "Second Stage Of War Begins, Says Israel PM Netanyahu Amid IDF’s Ground Operations In Gaza",
        "description": "Israel Palestine Conflict: Israel PM Netanyahu has declared that the second stage of war has begun. This announcement has been made amid the IDF's ground operations in Gaza..",
        "text": "Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu   \n         New Delhi : Israel and Palestine have been at conflict for decades but after  Hamas’ surprise attack  on Israel by firing 5000 rockets on  October 7 , the two nations have got into a full fledged war which has now entered its fourth week. Thousands of innocent lives have been taken, there has been devastation and destruction all around and the various countries of the world are calling for ceasefire.. but the countries continue to attack. Amid harrowing incidents of kidnapping, being held hostage, torture and death, the  Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu  has said that the second stage of war against Hamas is beginning.  \n             Second Stage Of War Has Begun: Israel PM Netanyahu Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday said that the second stage of the war against Hamas started with the entrance of more ground forces into Gaza on Friday night, The Times of Israel reported. He said that Israel’s goal is to “defeat the murderous enemy and to ensure our existence in our land. His statement comes after the Israel Defence Forces chief has said that the military is carrying out ground operations in the Gaza Strip at present which serve to achieve all the war’s objectives, The Times of Israel reported. Israeli Soldiers’ Goal Is ‘To Defeat Murderous Enemy, To Ensure Our Existence In Our Land’ Netanyahu said that the soldiers are part of a legacy of Jewish warriors that he stressed goes back 3000 years. He said that they have one goal, “To defeat the murderous enemy, and to ensure our existence in our land.” While addressing a press conference in Tel Aviv, he stressed that Israel’s war aims are clear – “destruction of Hamas’s military and governing capabilities; and returning the hostages home.” He said that the decision to start the ground incursion was made unanimously by the war cabinet and the security cabinet, according to The Times of Israel report. He stated, “Our commanders and soldiers fighting in enemy territory know that the nation and the national leadership stand behind them.” He said that the soldiers he has met in the field are determined to make Hamas pay for its actions on October 7. Netanyahu said, “They are determined to eradicate this evil from the world, for our existence and, I add, for all of humanity.” He said, “We always said, ‘Never Again’. Never Again’ is now.” Israel’s PM said his heart is broken after meeting families of kidnapped and pledged to utilize every opportunity to “return our kidnapped brothers and sisters to their families’ embrace.” He called their abduction a “crime against humanity.” \n             \n           ‘Those Who Dare To Accuse Our Soldiers Of War Crimes, Are Hypocrites And Liars’ Benjamin Netanyahu called those who “dare to accuse our soldiers of war crimes” hypocrites and liars. Calling IDF “the most moral army in the world,” he said that the “IDF does everything to avoid harm to non-combatants.” He called on the people of northern Gaza to relocate to the southern Gaza Strip. Netanyahu accused Hamas of war crimes and added that it “uses citizens as human shields” and hospitals as terror headquarters and takes fuel meant for hospitals to supply its war. He said, “Israel is fighting not only its war but humanity’s war against the barbarians,” The Times of Israel reported. He further said, “Our allies in the Western world, and our partners in the Arab world, know that if we do not win, they are next in line in the campaign of conquest and murder from the axis of evil.” He stated that the initial stage was a massive air campaign to allow Israel’s ground forces “to go in as safely as possible.” He stated that Israel destroyed countless headquarters and terrorist infrastructure. This Is Israel’s Second War Of Independence, Says PM Netanyahu Calling it Israel’s “second war of independence”, Netanyahu emphasised that the war will be “long and hard and we are ready.” He said that Israel would fight to defend the homeland and they would not withdraw. He said, “We eliminated countless murderers, including mass murderers. We destroyed countless headquarters and terrorist infrastructure. We are only at the beginning.” He said that Israel would destroy the enemy “above ground and below the ground” and called the war one of “light over darkness, life over death. This is the mission of our lives and my life.” Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu Meets Families Of Hostages On Saturday, Benjamin Netanyahu met representatives of families whose loved ones have been held captive in Gaza. After meeting them, Netanyahu said that Israel “will exercise exhaust every possibility” to bring about their return, The Times of Israel reported. He told the families that freeing the hostages was a chief goal of the war. He said, “The key is the level of pressure.” Netanyahu said, “The greater the pressure, the greater the chances [of freeing the captives]”, The Times of Israel reported. He also told them that there was no avoiding a major ground incursion, including to ratchet up pressure on Hamas. (Inputs from ANI)",

        "title": "A defining week set to lay bare the choice in the 2024 election",
        "text": "A defining week in politics will clarify the choice Americans will face in November in a fateful and unprecedented election that is already testing long-held interpretations of the Constitution and the powers of the presidency.\n     \n            The Supreme Court on Monday  rejected a push  in Colorado to throw ex-President Donald Trump off the ballot because of the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists.\n     \n             Trump  is meanwhile expected to emerge from the 15-state  Super Tuesday GOP primaries  within touching distance of a third straight Republican nomination. As he seeks a stunning White House return four years after trying to overturn the last election, the ex-president is showing a new term would be even more extreme than his first.\n     \n             President Joe Biden , meanwhile, will take the stage before a huge television audience two nights later for his State of the Union address. It’s a critical test for an 81-year-old commander in chief facing deep doubts that he’s fit to serve a second term as he’s beset by global crises and disappointment with his performance at home.\n     \n            A race between the current president and the ex-president is one that polls show many Americans dread. But Trump and Biden’s turns in the spotlight this week will highlight their all-but-certain rematch, barring health crises or other surprise events. Biden is highly vulnerable in a race that has no clear leader, according to the CNN Poll of Polls average.\n     \n            November’s election is already heaping pressure on political and electoral institutions, the Constitution and America’s fragile national unity. The country has never had an election in which one candidate faces  multiple criminal trials  and is running on the false premise that he was illegally ousted from power.\n     \n            Following Monday’s Supreme Court decision in the Colorado case, Trump’s name will appear on ballots that were printed weeks ago. Without a ruling from the justices, there was no guarantee voters who pick Trump would have their choice counted if justices decided he was ineligible to serve.\n     \n            The Supreme Court last week  agreed to hear another massive case, over Trump’s claims  of sweeping presidential immunity, which he’s made in response to his indictment for attempting to steal the 2020 election. The move further delayed the ex-president’s federal criminal trial over election interference, which Trump – who is seeking to push off his trials past the 2024 election – touted as a win.\n     \n            Both cases pose enormous questions about the legal foundation of the electoral system and whether presidents are truly subject to the same laws as other citizens.\n     \n            Four years ago, the Super Tuesday Democratic primaries saw Biden pull off a staggering political comeback, routing his rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and taking a decisive hold on the Democratic nomination. This year’s edition will likely prove similarly decisive for Trump, who is aiming for a sweep of big states to build on his cruise through early state contests and hopes to finally crush his last-remaining rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. A third nomination for Trump would represent an extraordinary comeback after he left office in disgrace two weeks after a mob of his supporters smashed their way into the US Capitol in an attempt to thwart certification of Biden’s election win.\n     \n            Ahead of a likely general election clash, Trump’s appetite for testing the rule of law and the Constitution is undimmed. He is promising a presidency of “retribution” against his political enemies in a campaign pulsating with some of the most venomous anti-immigrant and autocratic rhetoric in modern US history.\n     \n            Biden’s appearance in the House of Representatives on Thursday night, therefore, will not just mark a vital opportunity to court a primetime audience and to cultivate buzz that will reach many more viewers on social media. It will personify the implicit narrative of his campaign: that while voters may worry about the oldest president in history in a second term that would end when he’s 86, he’s the final bulwark between a second Trump presidency, which he warns could trash democracy.\n     \n            The former president’s march toward the Republican nomination  accelerated over the weekend  with his victories in the Idaho and Missouri caucuses and after he locked up  all Michigan’s delegates  to go with his thumping win in the state’s primary last week.\n     \n            The GOP front-runner will not be able to reach the 1,215 delegates he needs to win the nomination on Tuesday night, but his expected victories in a run of states with 865 delegates at stake will make him the presumptive GOP nominee in all but name. According to CNN’s latest calculations, Trump has 247 delegates compared with Haley’s 43. She scored her first victory Sunday night when  she won the GOP primary in Washington, DC .\n     \n            Trump’s dominance of the GOP primary race has enabled him to consolidate the congressional leaders of the party around him. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Republican leader in the Senate,  endorsed him  last week. And last week’s announcement from Mitch McConnell that he’ll soon  step down  as Senate GOP leader underscored the ex-president’s populist, nationalist transformation of a party once rooted in fiscal conservatism and globalism.\n     \n            Haley, stung by the  loss of her own state primary  in South Carolina last month, vowed Sunday to “keep fighting” because “70% of Americans say they don’t want Donald Trump or Joe Biden.” But there will be increasing pressure on her to bow out of the race if her opponent blows her out of the water Tuesday.\n     \n            “At some point, you have got to call it,” GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday. “I thought she would call it after she lost her own state in a horrible fashion. Now that we go into Super Tuesday, there’s not a chance she’s going to win a single state.”\n     \n            As Trump consolidates his power within the GOP, his rhetoric is becoming even wilder, in a campaign that is now inseparable from his defense in his multiple criminal trials. The ex-president, posing as a political “dissident,” falsely styles his daunting bill of  hundreds of millions of dollars  in restitution after several lost civil cases as proof of a campaign of political persecution by the Biden administration.\n     \n            On Saturday, Trump characteristically projected onto Biden the exact offense of which he is accused in several criminal cases, underscoring the threat the ex-president would pose to democratic institutions if he won back the White House.\n     \n            He told supporters in Greensboro, North Carolina, that Biden’s conduct amid a southern border crisis was tantamount to “a conspiracy to overthrow the United States of America.” He said: “Biden and his accomplices want to collapse the American system, nullify the will of the actual American voters and establish a new base power that gives them control for generations.”\n     \n            Trump’s comments reflect the vital importance of his case before the Supreme Court on his claim of almost blanket presidential immunity. The case is important not just in relation to his interference in the 2020 election; it points to his aspirations for unfettered political power if he wins in November.\n     \n            As his likely contest with Trump looms, Biden heads into the State of the Union address under enormous pressure to cut a vigorous and optimistic figure. He needs to show he’s a president in command and can transmit a vision for the future.\n     \n            A new round of polls released over the weekend underscored Biden’s challenges. The surveys portray a nation that most voters feel is headed in the wrong direction as they wait to feel economic benefits that official data show – and the White House insists – is a strong recovery. Biden looks vulnerable in these surveys on his management of the economy, inflation, the southern US border, the war in Ukraine and the war between Israel and Hamas.\n     \n            But the most striking aspect of the new surveys by  The New York Times/Siena College  and  The Wall Street Journal  lies in the profound concerns many voters have about the president’s age and his capacity. A majority of voters who backed Biden in 2020 now say he’s too old to serve effectively as president, according to the Times poll. There are fewer concerns about the 77-year-old Trump’s capacity. In the Wall Street Journal survey, 73% of respondents said Biden was too old to run for reelection. Some 52% thought the same of Trump.\n     \n            The president has in recent weeks tried to deflect such concerns by joking about his age. And last week, he was  certified as fit to serve  by his medical team after his annual physical examination. Biden has also spent recent weeks seeking to shore up key elements of his coalition, including union workers and minority and younger voters. And Democrats plan to jam Republicans over hardline abortion restrictions backed by Republican state legislatures and conservative judges in the wake of the overturning of the nationwide constitutional right to an abortion by the Supreme Court.\n     \n            But the new polling suggests the president’s efforts have done little to dismantle one of his biggest obstacles to reelection – his age. That’s why his State of the Union address is shaping up to be one of the most important such speeches this century.\n     \n            The appearance will come at a fraught moment. Another end-of-the-week deadline is looming to  avert a government shutdown . While leaders of both congressional chambers have reached a bipartisan spending deal, the tiny GOP House majority means any piece of legislation is a heavy lift. Biden is, meanwhile, under pressure as he  pushes for a long-term pause  in the fighting in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. Last week’s Michigan primary showed how anger among Arab American and progressive voters over his handling of the war  could threaten his prospects  in a vital general election swing state. Biden is also demanding  House Speaker Mike Johnson  put a foreign aid bill on the floor that would send $60 billion in weapons and other aid to Ukraine.\n     \n            Last year, Biden’s annual address was something of a triumph, as he shut down Republicans who heckled him and laid a trap for them as Democrats sought to portray the House majority as extreme. The president positioned himself as the last line of defense against the excesses of what he has called “ultra MAGA” Republicans. This is still the cornerstone of his reelection strategy.\n     \n            This year, the visual impression that the oldest president in history sends about his vigor and mental acuity may be as important as anything he actually says.",

        "description": "",
        "text": "Iranian president  Ebrahim Raisi , his foreign minister and other officials are missing after a helicopter crashed on Sunday in a mountainous border region during heavy fog. The Bell 212 civilian aircraft went down between Jolfa and Varzaqan, a region on the border of  Azerbaijani  exclave Nakhchivan, around 600km (375 miles) northwest of the Iranian capital  Tehran . It was carrying Raisi, 63, and Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian, the governor of Iran’s East Azerbaijan province and other officials and bodyguards, the state-run IRNA news agency reported.  The aircraft suffered what state TV called a “hard landing” after it got into difficulty during heavy fog following a visit with the Azerbaijani president to discuss an  infrastructure project  over the Aras River, which separates  Iran  and Nakhchivan. “We are still hopeful but information coming from the crash site is very concerning,” an Iranian official said. He added that Raisi’s life was “at risk”. Forty rescue teams including  Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards, ambulances, surgeons, drones and dogs were scrambled to locate the helicopter, which was hampered by rain, fog and dark conditions. open image in gallery {\"id\":\"trigger-autogallery-1191\",\"index\":0} Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, ambulances, surgeons, drones and dogs were scrambled to locate the helicopter   ( AP ) The chief of staff of Iran’s army ordered all resources of the army and the elite Revolutionary Guards to be put to use in search and rescue operations. “We are thoroughly searching every inch of the general area of the crash,” state media quoted a regional army commander as saying. “The area has very cold, rainy, and foggy weather conditions. The rain is gradually turning into snow.” On Sunday, Iranian state TV reported the helicopter had been found and quoted an official claiming a passenger and crew member were contacted. However, Iran’s Red Crescent denied the reports. State media has yet to report on casualties or confirm the whereabouts or condition of the president – but urged Iranians to pray for the president. Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Iran’s nuclear programme, sought to reassure Iranians and urged them to pray for the president’s health. View more “We hope that Almighty God will return the president and his companions to the nation, everyone should pray for their health. The people of Iran should not be worried, there will be no disruption in the work of the country,” Mr Khamenei said. In  Tehran , Iranian men and women were pictured publicly praying for Mr Raisi, with some kneeling down and some holding their hands to the sky. Meanwhile, many countries have offered their support to Iran, including allies such as Russia, neighbours such as Turkey, Azerbaijan and Armenia, and the EU. Russia said it was ready to extend “all necessary help” in the search for the missing helicopter and it hoped the president was still alive. The EU also said it had provided a satellite mapping service to Iran in response to a request by Tehran for help. open image in gallery {\"id\":\"trigger-autogallery-1192\",\"index\":1} In Tehran, Iranian men and women were pictured publicly praying for their missing president   ( AFP ) Turkish president  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  added he was “deeply saddened” by the crash and was ready to provide assistance to Iran. “I convey my best wishes to our neighbour, friend and brother Iranian people and government, and I hope to receive good news from Mr Raisi and his delegation as soon as possible,” Mr Erdogan said. President Raisi is a hardliner who formerly led the country’s judiciary. He is viewed as a protégé of Mr Khamenei and some analysts have suggested he could replace the 85-year-old leader after his death or resignation from the role. President Raisi won Iran’s 2021 presidential election, a vote that saw the lowest turnout in the Islamic Republic’s history.  open image in gallery {\"id\":\"trigger-autogallery-1193\",\"index\":2} President Raisi is a hardliner who formerly led the country’s judiciary   ( Getty ) He is sanctioned by the US in part over his involvement in the mass execution of thousands of political prisoners in 1988 at the end of the bloody Iran-Iraq war. Iran now enriches uranium at nearly weapons-grade level and hampers international inspections. The country has armed Russia in its war on Ukraine, and launched a massive drone-and-missile attack on Israel amid its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.  It also has continued arming proxy groups in the Middle East, like Yemen's Houthi rebels and Lebanon's Hezbollah.",

        "title": "Spy satellites may have detected preparations for Iran's missile attack on Israel",
        "text": "WASHINGTON — Israel likely had advance notice of  Tuesday’s missile attack  because U.S. and Israeli intelligence services monitor the mobilization and deployment of Iran’s missile units, according to a former senior U.S. military intelligence officer. How Israel, and ultimately the Pentagon, respond to the estimated hundreds of missiles fired at Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and other cities will depend on how many of them are intercepted by Israeli and U.S. air defenses, said Mark Quantock, a retired Army major general who oversaw intelligence for U.S. Central Command. Firing ballistic missiles required Iran to alert and deploy personnel to launch sites, movements that can be detected  by satellites , Quantock said. Communication to those forces may also have been intercepted. Findings like those may have triggered the warning issued Tuesday by the White House of an imminent attack. More:  Iran launches missile attack on Israel Once such activity is detected, launches, like Tuesday’s, can happen quickly, Quantock said. A senior White House official vowed “severe consequences” for an attack. If missiles penetrate Israeli air defenses, causing significant loss of life or property damage, the U.S. could be drawn directly into a conflict with Iran, Quantock said. “If, however, Iran swings and misses like they did last time − where Israel shot down  the vast majority of incoming Iranian missiles  − the U.S. response would likely be much more measured and likely not kinetic,” he said. Related:  No. 1 threat: Drone attacks prompt urgent $500 million request from Pentagon The Pentagon will offer  President Joe Biden  a wide range of potential military options. “It’ll be his choice on what to do,” Quantock said.",

        "text": "India and Australia Monday held 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue to step up defence cooperation and deepen the strategic relationship in sectors such as critical minerals and trade and investment. Defence Minister  Rajnath Singh  and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar met Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Richard Marles and Foreign Minister Penny Wong as part of the second India-Australia 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue. In a post on X, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said, “Ministers will exchange views on deepening multifaceted India-Australia ties, including in areas of defence and security, trade & investment, critical minerals, energy, climate change, S&T, space, education and people to people linkages. Regional and global issues are also on agenda.” \nAhead of the meeting, Wong and Marles visited the National War Memorial to pay respects to those who sacrificed their lives. “India and Australia have a long history of military relations – Australian soldiers have fought alongside Indian troops in a number of campaigns, including at Gallipoli,” Wong said on X. Calling the partnership with India “consequential” for Australia, Wong said Canberra deeply values its bilateral relationship with New Delhi, adding that it is “crucial to the region” where sovereignty is respected. In her opening remarks at the India-Australia 2+2 Defence and Foreign Ministerial Dialogue, she said, “We’ve done a lot of work together bilaterally and we hope to do more again today. I think what I would emphasize is that we value deeply the bilateral relationship, economic ties, the two way trade and investment, the people to people links, the climate initiatives particularly… that we’re working on together. But to again underline what we all know… this is a partnership which is consequential for us but it is crucial for our region and we see you India as central, crucial to the sort of region we continue to work for peaceful, stable, prosperous where sovereignty is respected and we look forward in this discussion to going further on the ways in which we can both work to deliver that.” Jaishankar discussed the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict and other issues with Marles. “A very good meeting with DPM and Defence Minister @RichardMarlesMP of Australia. Spoke about recent developments that influence the Indo-Pacific strategic scenario. Also exchanged views on West Asia,” he posted on X. “And yes, we discussed yesterday’s match.

        "description": "",
        "text": "A strike on a hospital in  Gaza  sheltering displaced families  has killed hundreds of people  – with the enclave’s health ministry claiming at least 500 are dead, including women and children. Israel  has denied accusations its forces were behind the deadly strike on the Anglican-run al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City, where hundreds of families fleeing Israel's bombardment had taken shelter. If the death toll is confirmed, the attack would be by far the deadliest airstrike in five wars fought over Gaza since 2008. Israeli prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  tweeted that “it was barbaric terrorists in Gaza that attacked the hospital in Gaza, and not the IDF”. Qatar, Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia lined up to blame Israel for the attack, whose military said its initial analysis showed a “barrage of rockets” fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza passed “in close proximity to the al-Ahli hospital in Gaza at the time it was hit”. “Intelligence from multiple sources we have in our hands indicates that [Palestinian] Islamic Jihad is responsible for the failed rocket launch which hit the hospital in Gaza,” the military said. Palestinian Islamic Jihad denied it was involved.

Other graphic videos allegedly capturing the aftermath show stunned people picking their way through the remains of dozens of bodies of adults and children littering the floor. Medics shout for help in the background. Ghassan Abu Sittah, a British Palestinian surgeon working with Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) who was at the hospital at the time called it a “massacre”. open image in gallery {\"id\":\"trigger-autogallery-10311\",\"index\":0} The scene of the hospital strike in Gaza   ( BBC ) “We were operating in the hospital, there was a strong explosion and the ceiling fell on the operating room,” he told MSF. The medical charity added that “hospitals are not a target. This bloodshed must stop. Enough is enough.” As many as 500 people are believed killed, with health ministry officials saying most of the casualties were displaced families, patients, children and women. open image in gallery {\"id\":\"trigger-autogallery-10312\",\"index\":1} An Injured child is taken into a hospital after Israeli air strike hit a hospital   ( REUTERS ) Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas called it “genocide\" and a “humanitarian catastrophe” while there were protests in the occupied West Bank. Jordan’s King Abdullah said the bombing of a Gaza hospital was a “war crime” that one cannot be silent about. In a royal court statement the monarch, who blamed the bombing on Israel, said Israel should immediately end its war against the enclave and that its actions against innocent Palestinians were a “shame on humanity”. Israel has launched near-constant airstrikes on the  Hamas -run Gaza Strip in retaliation for an attack by Hamas militants 10 days ago that killed more than 1,400 people. More than 3,000 inside Gaza have died in the airstrikes. Israel has faced global outrage after it announced a “total siege” on the tiny enclave and then announced an “evacuation” order for civilians to leave the north of Gaza for the south. It is widely speculated that this is preparation ahead of an anticipated ground offensive.  The World Health Organisation and rights groups have said the evacuation of hospitals was “impossible” and so the order could constitute the war crime of forcible transfer. Rights groups have argued the siege – which includes cutting off water, fuel, food and medical supplies to Gaza – is collective punishment and is also a violation of international law. open image in gallery {\"id\":\"trigger-autogallery-10313\",\"index\":2} Wounded Palestinians lay at the al-Shifa hospital, following Israeli airstrikes, in Gaza City   ( AP ) The horrific attack came on the eve of a visit by US president  Joe Biden , who is expected to show his support for Israel ahead of an expected ground invasion by Israel into Gaza. Mr Biden is also expected to discuss the humanitarian situation in Gaza and the return of hostages taken by Hamas during its attack.  Mr Abbas canceled a planned meeting with the president which was supposed to take place in Jordan. It has sparked uproar across the world and raised concerns the war in Gaza could spill across borders into a regional conflict. Iran condemned what it called a “savage war crime’” against hundreds of “unarmed and defenceless people”. Qatar strongly condemned it adding that “the expansion of Israeli attacks over the Gaza Strip to include hospitals, schools, and other population centres is a dangerous escalation.” Turkey said it was “barbaric”. Two days before Tuesday’s attack, the Archbishop of Canterbury had warned that al-Ahli hospital had already been hit by Israeli strikes. In that statement, he warned that the hospital “cannot be safely evacuated” and that it was “facing catastrophe”. open image in gallery {\"id\":\"trigger-autogallery-10314\",\"index\":3} A Palestinian man injured in an Israeli air strike is wheeled inside the Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis   ( AFP via Getty Images ) Tuesday’s horrific attack came on the same day as the United Nations’s Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) said that six people had been killed when an Israeli strike hit an Unrwa school, sheltering displaced people The agency said dozens of people were injured by the strike, which it said caused “severe structural damage” to the school, where at least 4,000 people were sheltering. “No place is safe in Gaza anymore, not even Unrwa facilities,” they had said. Health authorities in Gaza say at least 3,000 people have been killed in Israel's intense 11-day bombardment. The true death toll, however, is believed to be far higher as first responders have been unable to remove the bodies from under the rubble. Civilians who have fled to the south of Gaza told  The Independent  the situation was “disastrous”. “Since 7 October I have been displaced four times,” said Ghassan, who fled with his family and friends from Gaza city to Deir al-Salah in the centre of the country as both their homes had been destroyed in strikes. “The place we are at now has 35 people and zero water. My father is sick and handicapped. The children are terrified, and we are facing death every second.”",

        "title": "Bob Casey and Dave McCormick advance to the general election in Pennsylvania, setting up a key race for Senate control",
        "description": "Democratic Rep. Summer Lee and GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick fended off primary challengers, while other key House matchups were set for the fall.",
        "text": "Democratic Sen. Bob Casey and Republican Dave McCormick are officially set to face off in  Pennsylvania’s high-stakes Senate battle  this fall after winning their uncontested primaries on Tuesday. Casey, a three-term incumbent, and McCormick, who rallied the Pennsylvania GOP establishment behind his candidacy after announcing his bid last year, will now sprint toward the November election in one of the most bitterly contested, expensive Senate races in the country. The race is among a handful that could tip the balance of power in Congress’ upper chamber. “Pennsylvania deserves better than Bob Casey,” McCormick said during a victory speech on Tuesday. “At every single time where he could’ve been a leader instead of a follower, he’s chosen to be a follower.” For McCormick, a hedge fund executive and former official in President George W. Bush’s Treasury Department, his 2024 run comes on the heels of a failed 2022 bid against celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, who narrowly defeated him in a Republican primary with former President Donald Trump’s backing. Oz went on to lose to Democrat John Fetterman in the general election. This time around, McCormick has the support of Trump, as well as GOP leaders across Pennsylvania.  “It’s a big day in Pennsylvania and we hope the people get out there and vote,” Trump said outside his  criminal hush money trial  in New York on Tuesday. “It’s important to vote to let them know that we’re coming on November 5th. We’re coming big. Today’s preliminary but still it’s very important and maybe they’ll think also about the very good person who’s running for the Senate in Pennsylvania, Dave McCormick.” But even with a unified GOP behind him, McCormick faces an uphill battle. Republicans have lost race after race in the Keystone State following Trump’s shocking upset victory there in 2016. And Casey, the son of the state’s former governor, often polls ahead of President Joe Biden in the state. “Oh, the guy from Connecticut?” Fetterman told NBC News of McCormick, who Democrats have lambasted for  maintaining a Connecticut residence . “He loves Connecticut and he loves working and investing in Chinese companies. And I don’t think that’s a winner in Pennsylvania, but I guess we’re going to find out. Bob Casey is going to smoke him.” Presidential primary protest votes  The top of the ticket in Pennsylvania on Tuesday lacked drama, as not only were both Casey and McCormick running unopposed, but  the presidential primary  amounted to a formality as well, with both Trump and Biden having already clinched their party’s nominations. NBC News projected that both men would win their party’s primaries in Pennsylvania. But there was intrigue beneath the surface, as voters on both sides had the chance to submit protest votes on Tuesday. There was an organized effort to get Democratic voters to write in “uncommitted” on their presidential primary ballots to express opposition to Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. And Nikki Haley, who dropped out of the race in early March, still appeared on the Republican ballot.  Initial vote totals looked like Trump faced a more substantial protest vote than Biden. With roughly 95% of the expected vote counted on Wednesday morning, about 16% of Republican primary voters backed Haley — more than 150,000 in total. Pennsylvania has a closed primary system, so only registered Republicans could vote in that contest, unlike earlier primaries where Democrats and independents had a chance to cast ballots. But on the Democratic side, with 96% of the expected vote counted on Wednesday, about 5% went to write-ins. Biden, meanwhile, garnered about 88% of the vote while Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., got about 6% support after ending his candidacy last month. Not all counties tabulate write-in votes on election night, so the full scope of any write-in campaign might not be clear until all votes are counted. Still, more than 55,000 write-in votes were cast. Organizers backing an “uncommitted” vote protesting Biden's handling of the war between Israel and Hamas hoped to garner at least 40,000 write-in votes in their campaign.   It’s unclear how many write-in votes were associated with the effort. The Democratic primary is also only open to registered party members. In total, more than 163,000 Republican primary voters either voted for Haley or cast write-in votes. On the Democratic side, at least 123,000 voters chose Phillips or submitted a write-in. Biden eclipsed former President Barack Obama's vote total in the 2012 Democratic primary, the last time an incumbent Democrat ran for reelection. Biden won more than 926,000 votes in this year's primary, compared to about 616,000 for Obama in 2012. That year, about 19,000 Democratic primary voters cast write-in votes. Biden's raw vote total looks to have exceeded Trump's, who as of Wednesday morning had about 788,000 votes for him counted. In Pennsylvania's 2020 GOP primary, when Trump was an incumbent and did not face a serious primary challenge, he won just north of 1 million votes. With votes still being counted, Democrats looked to have an edge about about 100,000 voters turn out in their primary compared to the GOP contest. A similar number of votes remain to be counted in each race. The battle for the House  Further  down the ballot , there were a few races of significant intrigue. Chief among them was a House Democratic primary in the Pittsburgh area, where  NBC News projects  Rep. Summer Lee defeated Edgewood Borough Council member Bhavini Patel.  The race tested the power of sentiment over the war in Gaza, as Lee is the first among the progressive lawmakers who have been staunch critics of the Israeli war effort to face down a primary. And part of her district includes a prominent historically Jewish neighborhood, Squirrel Hill, that was home to the worst antisemitic attack in U.S. history in 2018. But Lee, a member of the “Squad” along with fellow progressives such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the House, was widely seen as a favorite ahead of Tuesday’s contest, as pro-Israel groups that spent against her in her initial 2022 primary opted against doing so this time.  Lee’s opponent, Bhavini Patel, was boosted by an outside expenditure from GOP megadonor Jeffrey Yass. Patel denounced Yass, but Lee and allies portrayed her as a conservative Democrat because of Yass’ involvement. Pennsylvania’s 12th District is solidly Democratic.  In eastern Pennsylvania, another House primary shaped up as one of the more important battles of the night as Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick fought off a GOP primary challenge from anti-abortion-rights activist Mark Houck. It wasn't the first time Fitzpatrick, a moderate Republican and former FBI agent, has faced a challenge from the right in the 1st District, which Biden carried in 2020. Fitzpatrick will now face Democrat Ashley Ehasz, an Army veteran whom he defeated by 10 points in 2022, again this fall.  Several general election matchups in competitive House races were also set in Pennsylvania, as Republicans nationally are aiming to hold onto a razor-thin majority in the lower chamber this year.  In the 7th District north of Philadelphia, state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie won the GOP primary, advancing to the what's expected to be a hotly contested general election against Democratic Rep. Susan Wild. Wild won a third term in 2022 by just 2 points after Biden won her district by less than 1 point in 2020.  In the 10th District, which includes Harrisburg, former local TV news anchor Janelle Stelson won a six-way Democratic primary to take on GOP Rep. Scott Perry, the former chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus who was involved in Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.  Stelson had the support of EMILY’s List, a group that backs female candidates who support abortion rights. Trump carried the district by 4 points in 2020.  Elsewhere, Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright will face Republican businessman Rob Bresnahan in the Scranton-area 8th District, which Trump carried four years ago. And Democratic Rep. Chris Deluzio will take on GOP state Rep. Rob Mercuri in the 17th District in the southwestern part of Pennsylvania, which Biden won by 6 points.  Allan Smith Allan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News.

        "title": "Ceasefire talks raise Gaza hopes but 1.5m trapped in Rafah fear the worst",
        "text": "Closed-door negotiations in Paris and UN efforts in New York yield conflicting reports of progress, but city of Rafah remains in Israel’s firing line  A closed-door meeting of spy chiefs, military officials and diplomats has briefly renewed hopes of a potential ceasefire deal amid fierce debates at the United Nations, but observers have   warned that time is running out to make progress and prevent a looming Israeli offensive on Gaza’s southernmost city. The secretive talks at an unknown location in Paris involved David Barnea, the head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence service, conducting separate meetings with Egyptian spy chief Abbas Kamel, head of the CIA William Burns and Qatari prime minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani. Israeli officials said they had dispatched negotiators to Paris with an expanded mandate. “We will expand the authority given to our hostage negotiators,” Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant  told US envoy to the Middle East  Brett McGurk last week. “At the same time, the IDF is preparing the continuation of intense ground operations.” The Israeli delegation had reportedly already left by Saturday morning to take any developments back to Israel’s war cabinet, dampening expectations that talks could continue into the weekend. The Israeli newspaper  Haaretz  reported that “significant progress was made” but did not specify what aspects of the talks had moved forward. Hamas representatives, speaking to the  Observer , said that there had been “no progress in the talks due to [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu’s stubbornness”. Negotiators met to discuss a pause in fighting along with the release of the remaining 136 hostages held by Hamas and other groups. The talks include details of an exchange of Palestinian prisoners and the entry of aid into  Gaza  for both civilian and military captives. Recent statements from Israeli officials that at least  31 of the hostages are dead , as well as the increasing threat of an Israeli ground offensive in Rafah, where an estimated 1.5 million people are sheltering, have only increased the time pressure for negotiators. “I think that time is not in our favour,” Qatar’s Sheikh Mohammed told the Munich security conference earlier this week, after a minister from Israel’s war cabinet  threatened a ground offensive  by the imminent Muslim holy month of Ramadan if no agreement was reached. “Ramadan is ahead of us now, and also as [the] situation in Rafah is evolving, it will be very dangerous for the entire region.” Daniel Levy, a former Israeli peace negotiator, said that Israel was “keeping the Americans warm, and not wanting to be blamed for the talks collapsing. If they can get things on their own terms, that’s fine, but they’re not yet ready for the Rafah ground offensive anyway.” US negotiators, he said, were attempting to drive progress over various details within the negotiations despite major disagreements on substantive issues such as a permanent ceasefire or the release of high-profile Palestinian prisoners. “There is apparently a hope in the talks that this time Hamas will change its position as it’s now feeling a degree of pressure it hasn’t previously, but there’s nothing to suggest that’s the case,” he said. A Hamas representative told  the Observer  that the Palestinian side currently feels that it has “nothing left to lose” due to the level of destruction in Gaza, as the death toll approaches 30,000. They are confident that their armed wing can continue fighting, they added. The group is seeking a prisoner swap of 500 Palestinian prisoners for every Israeli soldier held in Gaza, they said. Their broader demands – including an immediate ceasefire, the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops, and humanitarian aid to the north – remained unchanged. No exchange would take place without Israel fulfilling these requests, they added. At the same time as peace talks were being held in Paris, diplomatic negotiations have been taking place at the UN in New York.   On Tuesday, the  US vetoed a security ceasefire resolution  in the UN security council for the third time, but that did not entirely kill the matter. The US circulated an alternative resolution calling for a temporary ceasefire “as soon as practicable” and a block on any Israeli attack on Rafah. That resolution has since been discussed behind the scenes by experts from council member missions but it is not clear when or whether it will be introduced formally. Arab states are undecided on its merits and Russia and China are expected to block it on the grounds that it falls short of an immediate ceasefire. The UK abstained on Tuesday, sparing the US from absolute isolation in the council. The UK position, calling for an immediate suspension of hostilities to allow for negotiations on a sustainable ceasefire, was closer to the line taken by other council members than to the American stance, that a ceasefire could only be negotiated by the parties, not imposed from the outside. The view in Washington is that Netanyahu is keeping his options open, weighing between hostage negotiations and an assault on Rafah, and will only choose between them at a later date. Despite US president Joe Biden’s demands to Netanyahu in recent weeks that Israel should not conduct a ground invasion of Rafah without a plan to protect civilians, US officials currently see no signs of a humanitarian plan to accommodating Gazans displaced multiple times by Israeli military operations. They do not expect any such Israeli plan to come close to US requirements, let alone the standards set by international humanitarian agencies, but they do expect to see some sort of formal plan as a precursor to military preparations. “No plan presented for us to look at that I’m aware of in terms of Rafah operations,” John Kirby, White House national security spokesperson, told reporters. “We still would not support operations in Rafah, no matter what the timescale is. “We wouldn’t support those kinds of operations unless or until the Israelis had properly accounted for the safety and security of the more than one million people that are seeking refuge down there.” US officials say Israeli troops have been pulled out, and the military presence in the Gaza strip is at its lowest since the launch of the ground offensive at the end of October. Despite this, heavy bombardments of the enclave, including Rafah, have continued amid increasing reports of famine and dwindling supplies of aid.  Two UN agencies declared this week  that they are now unable to deliver aid to northern Gaza as desperate starving people have removed aid from trucks, and amid attacks on aid convoys. The UN said “catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity” were intensifying across Gaza while Save the Children reported that families were forced to “forage for scraps or food left by rats and eating leaves out of desperation to survive”. Biden administration officials have voiced frustration over Israel’s very patchy cooperation over humanitarian efforts, and Netanyahu’s promotion of a post-conflict plan for Gaza that excludes the Palestinian Authority, but they claim they have little leverage over him. There is no sign of Biden using the most powerful form of leverage available to him, namely threats to halt the flow of arms and ammunition. The  Wall Street Journal   reported last week  that a new shipment of about a thousand MK-82 bombs and thousands of bomb components is in the pipeline. Ceasefire negotiations had stalled prior to the latest meeting in Paris after Hamas demanded a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the enclave, and a prisoner swap. Netanyahu derided these demands as “delusional” and said Israeli forces would push ahead with a ground invasion of Rafah without an agreement on freeing the remaining hostages.",

        "title": "College Must Be More Accessible—and Valuable—for More Students | Opinion",
        "text": "While high school seniors across the country are finalizing their college applications, more and more of their classmates are passing up on higher education.  Fewer Americans  than ever before believe college is worthwhile, with  45 percent  of young adults saying that a high school diploma is all they need to ensure financial stability. This sentiment is misguided, but it is reflected in decreasing college enrollment. Today, the U.S. has a  smaller percentage  of college-age students in school than most other developed nations. As a parent and a first-generation college graduate who has experienced a significant return on investment from my college degree, I'm worried. As a college president, I'm doing something about it. The fastest growing jobs available to non-college-educated workers are mostly low-wage. Meanwhile, the \"wage premium\" for early-career college graduates is  52 percent —and that's projected to grow as the demand rises for graduates to fill well-paying jobs. Over their lifetimes, college graduates earn, on average,  nearly $1 million  more than high school graduates. At a time of growing income inequality, it seems confounding that more students are foregoing the opportunity to earn more. Yet, it's not as surprising when you consider rising student loan debt and the attention it understandably gets. Student loan debt has grown roughly  270 percent  since 2006, and relief efforts have stalled. Additionally, approximately  40 percent of college students drop out  before graduating, compounding the financial burdens of any loans those students take. Furthermore, many young people have family or financial obligations that put a traditional college experience out of reach. Higher education institutions can and must do more to address the inequality caused by these dynamics by creating more opportunities for students to enroll and graduate. This is even more urgent after the  Supreme Court  ruling banning race-based affirmative action; we need to work harder to address  racial income and wealth gaps . The College of Mount Saint Vincent in the Bronx, where I serve as president, has been prioritizing the enrollment of, and support for, students who face barriers to college enrollment and persistence. We have the nation's  fourth highest percentage of students  receiving federal Pell Grants, which go to students with exceptional financial need. We were recently ranked No. 1 in the northeast on  U.S. News & World Report' s list of  Top Performers on Social Mobility . \t Read more \n   Closing the Racial Wealth Gap for Black Women \n   The Fight for Parents' Rights in Education Isn't Over \n   Hamas Can Never Again Decide Who Shall Live and Who Shall Die \n With the cost of college skyrocketing, we commit to offering 100 percent of our first-year students scholarship aid, and we provide more than $37 million in scholarships per year to our over 2,000 undergraduate students. For years, Mount Saint Vincent has waived application fees, removing one more financial barrier. Our commitment to reducing costs results in our students graduating with one-third less in loan debt than the average New York college student. \n \n People walk around the campus of Hunter College of The City University of New York, on April 10, 2017, in New York City. \n People walk around the campus of Hunter College of The City University of New York, on April 10, 2017, in New York City. \n Drew Angerer/Getty Images \n      But reducing the financial burden is not enough. Nationally, just over 60 percent  of students at four-year institutions graduate in six years, and among low-income, first-generation students the rate plummets to  about 10 percent . Students face serious barriers to persistence: many find the college experience stressful; mental health challenges post-pandemic have skyrocketed; others struggle academically. Dedicated advisors, in addition to a faculty advisor, who collaboratively support and guide students throughout their studies, and strategize a path to career success, are key to persistence. Additionally, low-income learners are  more likely to work longer hours  to support themselves and their families, making the traditional college experience more challenging. Higher education institutions must give students more options to attend and stay in college. Amid the rise of online learning and the growth of alternative models, we have prioritized flexibility, offering an array of affordable graduate programs fully online and are in process of building out undergraduate offerings that are market-responsive for adults who want to change or advance in their careers. In October, we announced the launch of  Seton College , a new two-year college on our campus that results in associate degrees that include an array of options of certificates, in partnership with the Come to Believe Network. It's designed to provide pathways—priced so that students do not incur debt while completing their associate degree—for underserved students to receive four-year degrees. Our efforts are paying off. More of our Pell-eligible students are graduating and our enrollment is steadily increasing, but I know we need to do more. According to a recent  McKinsey study , nearly nine in 10 jobs projected to be created through 2030 will likely require postsecondary education. Not nearly enough students are enrolled in college to meet the future demand and the opportunity to benefit economically from these jobs. I challenge my fellow college and university presidents to take action to address this gap and create more opportunities for students to attend college. Dr. Susan R. Burns is the president of the College of Mount Saint Vincent, which recently earned university status and will be named the University of Mount Saint Vincent beginning in January 2024.

        "title": "Blinken says Israel has agreed to US proposal to close remaining gaps on ceasefire deal and calls on Hamas to do the same",
        "text": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday that Israel has accepted a  proposal to bridge gaps  in ceasefire negotiations and the next step is for Hamas to accept ahead of further negotiations expected to take place later this week.\n     \n            “The next important statement is for Hamas to say yes, and then, in the coming days, for all of the expert negotiators to get together to work on clear understandings on implementing the agreement,” Blinken said at a press conference in Tel Aviv.\n     \n            Despite the claims of Netanyahu’s agreement to the bridging proposal, there are still significant challenges before a deal can actually be reached. Not only has Hamas not agreed to the proposal but negotiators are still working on specific details on how an agreement would be implemented. They are also working to establish “clear understandings on how the different parties are going to make good on their commitments,” the top US diplomat said.\n     \n            Ahead of his meetings with Israeli officials Monday, Blinken said the push to finalize a  ceasefire and hostage deal  in Gaza has reached a “decisive moment,” as he visited Israel before going on to Egypt and Qatar on Tuesday.\n     \n            This is “probably the best, maybe the last, opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a ceasefire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security,” Blinken said in remarks alongside Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv before the two met.\n     \n            “It is time for everyone to get to yes, and to not look for any excuses to say no,” Blinken said. “It is time for it to get done. It’s also time to make sure that no one takes any steps that could derail this process.”\n     \n            At his press conference, Blinken underscored the urgency of the moment, noting that “intervening events come along that may make things even more difficult, if not impossible.”\n     \n            “We’ve experienced that throughout this process, so there’s the fierce urgency of now,” he said.\n     \n            The announcement by Blinken and the Israeli prime minister’s office that Israel had agreed to the bridging proposal followed a three-hour meeting between the top US diplomat and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem earlier Monday. Both sides described the meeting as constructive. Netanyahu committed to sending senior negotiators to “complete this process” in either Qatar or Egypt, Blinken said.\n     \n            It is unclear what exactly is in the “bridging proposal.” It was put forward last week by the US, with the support of Qatar and Egypt, following two days of high-stakes talks in Doha. The mediators have been stepping up efforts as the Middle East braces for a possible Iranian attack on Israel, and after the death toll since October in Gaza reportedly reached 40,000 people — a bleak figure that underscores 10 months of suffering, malnutrition and despair in the Palestinian enclave during Israel’s war with Hamas.\n     \n            On Sunday evening, Hamas and Netanyahu traded accusations suggesting that a deal may still be far off. Hamas suggested it had rejected the proposal.\n     \n            Hamas said the latest proposal didn’t include a permanent ceasefire and introduced new conditions on the exchange of prisoners, among other issues.\n     \n            The group blamed Netanyahu for “obstructing” a deal from being reached and reiterated its desire to enact a three-phase proposal presented by US President Joe Biden, which would include the release of hostages from Gaza, a “full and complete ceasefire,” and the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. It called on mediators to “compel the occupation to implement” that plan.\n     \n            Netanyahu shot back, saying Israel will not be “giving in to Hamas’s demand” to end the war in Gaza as a condition of a deal.\n     \n            “The Prime Minister has strongly insisted on this fundamental demand, which is vital to achieving the goals of the war, and Hamas changed its position,” a statement from his office said Sunday. “The Prime Minister will continue to work on advancing a deal that will maximize the number of living hostages and which will enable the achieving of all of the war objectives.”\n     \n            At his news conference Monday, Blinken said he could not “speculate on exactly what Hamas’s intentions are,” but expected to learn more in his conversations with Egyptian and Qatari officials on Tuesday.\n     \n            “We’ve seen public statements, but we’ve seen public statements before that don’t fully reflect where Hamas is,” he said.\n     \n            Other key sticking points in talks include Israel’s insistence on controlling the border between Gaza and Egypt, having a veto over which Palestinian prisoners are released and preventing the movement of armed men from southern Gaza to the north.\n     \n            As the diplomatic efforts continue, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise.\n     \n            At least 15 people were killed in two separate Israeli strikes on Gaza Monday, including seven former bodyguards of the late Hamas political bureau leader Ismail Haniyeh, Gaza Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmoud Basal told CNN.\n     \n            The strike on the Al-Shati refugee camp northwest of Gaza City in the northern Gaza Strip killed nine people, including the bodyguards, according to Basal.\n     \n            The second strike hit an area behind the Austrian Towers - residential buildings west of Khan Yunis, south of the Gaza Strip, killing at least six people and injuring 15 others, Basal said.\n     \n            CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on both incidents for comment.\n     \n            Separately, an Israeli soldier was killed in the southern Gaza Strip, the IDF announced in a short statement Monday.\n     \n            IDF said earlier Monday that its troops “expanded the operation in the Gaza Strip to the Khan Yunis area and the outskirts of Deir al-Balah,” in a statement.\n     \n            “The troops are eliminating terrorists, destroying combat compounds above and below ground,” the statement added.\n     \n            Speaking alongside Herzog on Monday, Blinken acknowledged it is a “fraught moment” for Israel over concerns about the possibility of attacks from Iran and its proxies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, and said the US has “taken decisive actions… to deter any attacks and if necessary to defend against any attacks.”\n     \n            “We’re working to make sure that there is no escalation, there are no provocations, that there are no actions that in any way could move us away from getting this deal over the line, or, for that matter, escalating the conflict to other places and to greater intensity,” he said.\n     \n            As Blinken arrived in Israel on Sunday, there was an explosion in Tel Aviv that Israeli officials declared to be a terror attack. Hamas’ armed wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, claimed responsibility for the explosion.\n     \n            In the evening, an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza killed seven members of the same family, medical officials said. Six children and their mother were killed in the strike on a home in  Deir al-Balah,  according to the Al-Aqsa hospital. The children’s father was injured, a hospital spokesperson said.\n     \n            It comes just a day after an Israeli strike killed at least 15 people, all from the same family, in the al-Zawayda area of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. Nine children were among those killed, according to the Gaza Civil Defense.\n     \n            In a statement Sunday, the Israeli military said forces continue to operate in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah. Adding to Gazans’ woes, doctors last week detected the  first case of polio  in the enclave in 25 years.\n     \n             CNN’s Kareem Khadder and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed reporting.",

        "title": "New York Times dissects widely circulated Gaza hospital attack evidence video, ‘casts doubt on Israel’s claims'",
        "description": "NYT investigation raises doubts about evidence in Gaza hospital explosion",
        "text": "Amid growing criticism over its coverage of the recent attack on a Gaza hospital that reportedly led to multiple casualties New York Times has come out with an analysis to dissect what actually led to the blast and is the narrative set by Israel correct. Its detailed analysis of the visuals available of the missile attack sheds doubt on the widely cited evidence.                 A girl carries blankets as she walks past the site of a deadly explosion at al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City(AP)         New York Times report claims, the examination of a recent explosion at the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City has unveiled a discrepancy in the narrative surrounding the incident. Initially, Israeli and American officials attributed the blast to a malfunctioning Palestinian rocket, based on a video clip from an Al Jazeera broadcast on the night of October 17. However, it further claims there is a discrepancy in series of visuals leading to worldwide narrative set on the attack.       Israeli authorities  and Hamas terrorists have pinned the blame on each other for the Al-Ahli Arab explosion and several videos circulating on the internet show that militants were firing dozens of rockets from southwest of the hospital minutes before the blast.   Also Read;  US analysis shows Israel not responsible for Gaza hospital blast: White House   Times report adds a disclaimer,  ‘The Times’s finding does not answer what actually did cause the Al-Ahli Arab hospital blast, or who is responsible. But the Times analysis does cast doubt on one of the most-publicized pieces of evidence that Israeli officials have used to make their case and complicates the straightforward narrative they have put forth.’   The footage, initially interpreted to showcase a Palestinian rocket causing the deadly explosion at the hospital, has been re-evaluated by The NYT. Their analysis concluded that the projectile seen in the video detonated in the sky about two miles away from the hospital, portraying an unrelated episode of the ongoing skirmish across the Israeli-Gaza border that night.      This analysis by The NYT doesn't unveil the actual cause or the responsible party for the Al-Ahli Arab hospital blast but questions the straightforward narrative previously put forth, especially by Israeli officials.   Further investigations by The NYT into the multiple videos from the night of the explosion show Palestinian militants firing rockets from southwest of the hospital minutes before the blast. Additionally, the evidence suggests Israeli bombardment was ongoing, and two explosions near the hospital were recorded within two minutes of the hospital being struck.      This narrative becomes more complicated as both Israeli and U.S. intelligence agencies maintain their stance that a Palestinian rocket was responsible for the hospital explosion. Despite the conflicting interpretations of the Al Jazeera video footage between American intelligence and The NYT, the quest for real evidence continues amidst a complex scenario of ongoing hostilities.   The extensive scrutiny by The NYT involved synchronizing the Al Jazeera footage with five other videos, utilizing satellite imagery to triangulate the launch point, ultimately tracing the projectile back to Israeli territory. However, the type of projectile remains unidentified. These findings contradict the initial narrative and highlight the intricate nature of unfolding events in the conflict-ridden region.            New York Times screengrab showing the range of missile trajectory     The examination of this incident underscores the broader challenges in discerning the real reason amid a high-stakes, emotionally charged conflict. The varying interpretations of evidence, as showcased by the differing conclusions drawn from the Al Jazeera video, reflect the broader narrative of an ever-evolving, multifaceted conflict where every piece of evidence can potentially tip the scale of public opinion and political stance.   This report is curated based on an article from The New York Times, which provides a detailed visual analysis concerning a significant incident in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict.",

        "title": "No time for niceties: David Cameron in hurry to make mark on world stage",
        "text": "From Ukraine to Palestine, the UK foreign secretary is determined to play a role as history unfolds A day after the Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene declared “David Cameron can kiss my ass” over his  references to the appeasement of Hitler  in an article appealing to US lawmakers to pass a Ukraine funding bill, the UK foreign secretary returned to the theme. Stood alongside his Polish counterpart, Radosław Sikorski, another experienced politician recently recalled to high office, he said: “Today, two foreign ministers stand here just like in the 1930s, when we faced a similar challenge in the case of an aggressive dictator who tried to change the world by force and ignored the sovereignty and inviolability of other countries’ borders.” Ukraine, he said, was “a challenge for our generation”, adding that the last time a dictator in Europe was allowed to invade other countries, Poland suffered the greatest consequences. With a limited period in office and the stakes so high, Cameron is a man in a hurry, showing a determination to leave a mark during his second chance in government even at the risk of fluttering diplomatic dovecotes. Sikorski, who returned to office last year after the defeat of the rightwing populist Law and Justice party, had the confidence this week to challenge Donald Trump’s transactionalism when the likely US Republican presidential candidate shocked Nato states by  saying he would be happy to see Vladimir Putin invade  countries that did not meet the target of spending 2% of their GDP on defence. He said on Thursday, alongside Cameron, that stopping Russian imperialism was a basic condition for preserving freedom and the value system of the civilised world. Of Trump’s comments, he observed that Nato’s article 5 had been activated only once, after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US.  Poland  had then committed itself to Afghanistan and “did not send the bill to Washington”, he said. Cameron, who with Sikorski appealed for the US Congress to adopt an aid package for Ukraine, is aware he is taking risks and potentially offending supporters of Trump. On Israel as well, he feels inclined to do what he describes as showing some leg – by proposing that the UK  might recognise a Palestinian state  before any negotiations on a  two-state solution  are complete. He has also become ever more blunt that he thinks Israel is  in breach of international humanitarian law  if it fails to provide food, water and fuel to those trapped in Gaza. Cameron was aware  his article  dispensed with some diplomatic niceties. By writing in the US Congress-focused newspaper the Hill, he wanted to reach his target audience, to urge them to do their duty by the transatlantic alliance. The reference to 1930s appeasement and his grandfather fighting in the second world war was some calculated additional spice. He believes there is a natural majority in the US Senate and House to provide the aid for Ukraine and feels it is legitimate for the UK to help try to unlock it. As to claims he is interfering in the domestic politics of the US, he says to accept that is to accept the thinking of American isolationists that the US can withdraw from the world without any consequence save fewer bills. It is not the first time he has made the argument. On his previous trip to the US he used an Aspen Security Forum to say he was “worried that we’re not doing to do what we need to do” on Ukraine, adding that he wanted to address the argument he had heard repeatedly in US political circles: “Why should we meet these challenges overseas when there are so many challenges at home?” The checklist was simple. Ukraine was not losing.  Europe  was pulling its weight and paying its fair share. The military objectives were clear. It was a good investment, indeed value for money. Ten per cent of the US defence budget used by the Ukrainians has destroyed half of Russia’s prewar assets. Ukraine’s defeat would leave only two people smiling: Putin in Russia, and Xi Jinping in Beijing. He finished by asking them to recognise that “European security is also American security”. It is an argument that pits him against Donald Trump, someone he had no dealings with as prime minister and is unlikely to have future dealings with if the Conservatives are defeated, as expected, in a general election this year. Although he shares Boris Johnson’s determination to support Ukraine, he has none of Johnson’s illusions that Trump is essentially a liberal New Yorker. The Congress vote and the threatened return of Trump play into a wider discussion in Europe about how it responds politically and militarily. It is a debate in which the naturally pro-European Cameron would like to play a role, including on boosting weapons production. Europe, for its part, is wondering if it will need to ask for the UK’s nuclear weapons to come to its defence in the event of a US pullout. A natural optimist who thought he could persuade voters to reject the isolationism of Brexit, Cameron admits the world has turned into a darker place since he left office in 2016, badly damaged by the misjudgment of staging an arguably unnecessary Brexit referendum. His staff are very aware that it is easy for any UK foreign secretary to watch the pages of history turn without leaving any mark on them. With probably less than 10 months left in office, and two massive world crises playing out, it requires him to move with a speed and pointedness that others might not. He also knows that as long as he makes no major mistakes, he has the confidence of a prime minister who has to focus on trying to win the next election. Rishi Sunak will not be attending the Munich Security Conference this weekend, unlike Cameron and the Labour leader, Keir Starmer. From Munich Cameron flies to the G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in Brazil where he hopes to take on the global south, and those that say the west has shown hypocrisy and double standards over Ukraine and  Israel . Once the youngest prime minister since 1812, and never lacking in self-confidence, he hopes his experience in foreign affairs will help him navigate ending one war in Gaza and keeping another in Ukraine alive. It is likely to be a bumpy ride.",

Despite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.",

KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan — Speaking to the U.S. Bar Association last week, Aaron Keyak, the State Department's deputy special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism, warned of the growth of antisemitism in China following  Hamas' massacre of Israelis  Oct. 7.         \n        \n       \"There’s been an increase in the People’s Republic of China’s state media and online discourse of antisemitic tropes that Jews control the United States through deep U.S.-Israel ties, as well as control over banks, the media, and that they have influence over government leaders,\" Keyak said.  \"Conjecture that Jews control the  U.S. government  and U.S. wealth is an antisemitic falsehood intended to degrade trust in the United States, our democratic institutions and, ultimately, democracy around the globe.\"      The statements from the administration will be welcomed by many who have been monitoring Chinese antisemitism, an already existing problem that has grown worse since the Hamas massacres Oct. 7 and the subsequent war in Gaza.      \n        \n       ISRAEL OMITTED FROM ONLINE MAPS IN CHINA AMID WAR ON HAMAS IN GAZA     Most of the hatred expressed has been online. Reports show Chinese \"netizens\" openly mocking the parents of the half-Chinese, Israeli-born captive Noa Argamani, who was seen in a viral video looking terrified as she was kidnapped by Hamas. Argamani's Chinese-born mother has been targeted with strings of profanities after she asked Beijing to help secure her daughter's release. Chinese web users frequently compare  Israel’s actions  in Gaza to the Holocaust, with Israel playing the role of the Nazis. YouTube is banned in China, but the most popular Chinese version of a video site, Bilibili, along with other social media platforms operated by TikTok owner ByteDance, including TouTiao and Xigua, is awash with pro-Hitler videos, memes, pro-Nazi content and antisemitic tropes.      \n        \n       The Times of Israel reported in late 2023 that Steven Spielberg’s \"Schindler’s List,\" previously a hit in China, had been \"review-bombed\" down from 9.7 to a 4.3 rating. One highly-rated comment from a reviewer in China asked, \"Where is the Palestinian Schindler?\"      Noa Argamani, 26, is being held by Hamas somewhere in Gaza.   (Courtesy: Bring Them Home Now) As Israel’s war against Hamas heated up in October, Chinese search giants Alibaba and Baidu, for a time, made Israel disappear. The Jewish state could no longer be found on either site’s map apps.      The chance that this removal of Israel \"from the river to the sea\" was due to a  tech glitch  is virtually zero. China's internet is the most policed on earth, and few observers believe this map incident was anything other than a childish gesture meant to bring a few moments of joy to pro-Hamas Chinese netizens.         \n        \n       EXCLUSIVE: JEWISH EMPLOYEES AT TIKTOK SHARE DETAILS OF HOSTILE, ANTISEMITIC WORK ENVIRONMENT Meron Medzini, professor emeritus at the Department of Asian Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 91, has had a front-row seat to history, watching both the emergence of the State of Israel and the  People’s Republic of China , a country he’s visited a dozen times.      A popular Weibo top search query interface is displayed on a phone in Ganzi City, Sichuan Province, China, Dec. 31, 2021.    (Wang Jianfeng/Costfoto/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Medzini told Fox News Digital that the \"recent antisemitic publications and other forms of [antisemitic] expression in China should be seen as an expression of anti-Americanism. The belief is that Jews have vast influence on American politics, media, academia, banking and finance and, thus, in fact, control America. It is easier to attack Jews than America.\"          \n        \n       Medzini is the author of books on the history of Taiwan-Israel relations as well as Japan and the Jews during the Holocaust era. Speaking to Fox News Digital from his office in Taipei, Ross Darrell Feingold, founding chairman of the Chabad Taipei Jewish Center in Taiwan and an analyst of Chinese foreign policy, explained that even if the CCP is not directly promoting antisemitic hate speech, up to now it has not required the platform operators to clamp down.  \"On my Chinese social media account, the antisemitic vitriol directed at me is astounding,\" Feingold said. \"It includes the usual stereotypes such as Jews control global wealth and U.S. foreign policy, to more extreme comments such as references to Jews going up in smoke or are better off being turned into soap\".     The flag of China is flown behind a pair of surveillance cameras outside the Central Government Offices in Hong Kong, China, July 7, 2020.     (Roy Liu/Bloomberg via Getty Images)     \n        \n       There is evidence that even the official Chinese news media have been given the green light to air  antisemitic tropes . In his address to the U.S. Bar Association, SEAS Deputy Aaron Keyak noted, \"For example, in an October 2023 program on ‘uncovering the Israel elements of U.S. elections in history,’ PRC state media (China’s central television) alleged that ‘Jews who represent 3% of the U.S. population control 70% of its wealth.'\"         SCHUMER CALLS ON XI TO SUPPORT ISRAEL AS CHINA SAYS RELATION WITH US ‘WILL DETERMINE THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY’ The hate, however, runs deeper than old tropes. As the Gaza war continued into the end of 2023, Su Lin, a frequent contributor to Chinese state media and a senior research fellow at China’s most prestigious \"private\" think tank, the Center for China and Globalization (CCG), reportedly went as far as saying publicly, \"Hamas was too gentle\" or, in another translation, \"Hamas went too soft on Israel.\"       \n        \n       Feingold also says the CCP, to maintain tight control and prevent internal ethnic strife, would not tolerate similar vitriol on social media if it was directed at China’s Muslims, such as Uyghurs or the Hui ethnic group.      This image made from undated bodycam video footage taken by a downed Hamas terrorist and released by Israel Defense Forces shows a Hamas terrorist walking around a residential neighborhood at an undisclosed location in southern Israel.   (Israel Defense Forces via AP) Medzini noted that China was once a sincere friend to the Jewish people and the State of Israel.      \"The father of modern China, Sun Yat-sen, supported Zionism and the return of Jews to Israel,\" he said. \"Although Japan was an ally of Nazi Germany during WWII, in Japanese-occupied China, Jews were not persecuted, and as a result, some 30,000 Jews survived the war. Nationalist China was the first Asian nation to recognize Israel in March 1949, while Israel was among the first ten non-Communist nations to recognize the People's Republic of China in January 1950.\"      \n        \n       CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Before the Israel-Hamas war started, Feingold published a commentary calling on the  Biden-Harris administration  to send the U.S. antisemitism ambassador to China. However, he told Fox News Digital, \"Despite a few references recently in public remarks, I’m not optimistic that the Biden-Harris administration’s China engagement efforts will really include tackling antisemitism in China.\"      Another country that seems concerned about the growing trend is Germany. Writing in Chinese, the German embassy posted a comment on Weibo, China’s version of X, formerly known as Twitter.      Palestinian Hamas terrorists during a military show in the Bani Suheila district July 20, 2017, in Gaza City, Gaza.   (Chris McGrath/Getty Images)         \n        \n       The translated tweet says, \"Dear netizens, we need to emphasize the rules of the comment area again: We believe in the power of free speech and rational debate. Therefore, we allow some negative, critical and controversial comments to appear below our posts. … But all this is not without limitations. … We also want to make it clear that those who deliberately combine the Israeli flag with Nazi symbols in their profile pictures are either ignorant idiots or shameless bastards! Such accounts will be permanently blocked by us.\" But stern comments from the  German embassy  have had little to no effect in reducing the vast amount of antisemitic content on Chinese social media platforms. Considering how tightly controlled China’s internet is, critics wonder if it’s fair to ask why the platform operators or Chinese government haven’t taken action.      Eryk Michael Smith is a  Taiwan-based  correspondent who since 2007, has worked both as a broadcast journalist for the island's only English-language radio station, ICRT, as well as with numerous other publications and local news outlets.

She was abducted from Kibbutz Be’eri on Oct. 7 during an early morning walk, the kibbutz announced. In a Facebook post Friday, Mor Metro-West High School in Ra’anana announced that one of its alumni, Guy Iluz, 26, who was kidnapped during the Supernova music festival near Re’im where more than 360 revelers were massacred by the terror group, had lost his life. \n\n\n \n Israel did not say how or when the six died but said they perished while being held in Gaza. \n\n\n\n “This comes after a team of Health Ministry experts, the [Abu Kabir Forensic Institute], the chief rabbi and Religious Affairs Ministry declared their deaths based on findings that were collected and intelligence,” said IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari Hagari. \n\n\n\n Zalmanovich was a founder of the kibbutz and a father of two, according to a tribute post.  \n\n\n\n “Aryeh was a man of the land all his life who was engaged in agriculture and field crops.

        "title": "Israel’s secret air war in Gaza and the West Bank",
        "description": "U.N. officials and open-source data researchers say the full details of Israel’s bombing campaign remain largely unknown.",
        "text": "Day and night, according to Palestinians, a sound echoes above Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza. The noise isn’t the detonation of a bomb dropped by an Israeli jet. It’s the low hum of Israeli drones circling overhead.  “They never leave the sky,” Tareq Hajjaj, a freelance Palestinian journalist, said via WhatsApp.  As civilians flee northern Gaza, the focus of international attention — and the fears of many Palestinians — is how Israel may wage war in southern Gaza. The focus, in particular, is on airstrikes.  Israeli officials, including two active-duty drone pilots, said they follow exacting procedures to minimize civilian casualties. An Israel Defense Forces military attorney must sign off on every strike after a review of intelligence. And pilots must conduct real-time analyses of potential civilian deaths.  “We preplan what happens if children enter into our area,” said one of the drone pilots, referring to calling off a strike. “We preplan what happens if the terrorists launch a rocket and then drive into a crowded area, as they so often do.”  Critics of Israel’s tactics say the sheer volume of airstrikes it has conducted in such densely populated areas is worrying. In the first week of the conflict, which began after Hamas’ Oct. 7 terrorist attack killed more than 1,200 Israelis, the IDF dropped 6,000 bombs in Gaza. In 2019, the U.S. dropped 7,400 bombs in Afghanistan over the course of an entire year.  A fireball erupts above Gaza City after an Israeli airstrike on Oct. 9. Mohammed Abed / AFP via Getty Images file Professor Janina Dill, a co-director of Oxford University’s Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict, said she is concerned Israel might be violating international law.  She cited the number of airstrikes, the  reported deaths of 13,000  Palestinians and statements by Israeli officials that she said suggested they believed that not all Palestinian civilians deserve protection.  “If we take these three things together,” Dill said, “then it’s really difficult to believe that all airstrikes here comply with international humanitarian law.” Since disclosing the number of airstrikes it carried out during the war's first week, the IDF has declined to say how many bombings it has conducted. An Israeli official who asked not to be named said he couldn’t disclose whether jets or drones carry out the majority of the Israeli strikes.  “A lot of the things in Gaza are unmanned aircraft, and some of the things are not,” he said. Last week, Human Rights Watch  accused  the Israeli military of \"repeated, apparently unlawful attacks on medical facilities\"  and said they \"should be investigated as war crimes.\" Israeli officials accuse Hamas of building command centers beneath hospitals.  The Biden administration, meanwhile, has provided little information regarding the accuracy of Israeli airstrikes, while   closely monitoring and condemning Russian attacks that kill Ukrainian civilians. With war crimes investigators and international journalists unable to operate independently in Gaza, United Nations officials and open-source data researchers say the full details of Israel’s bombing campaign remain largely unknown. “It’s really tricky,” said a researcher who asked not to be named. “It’s difficult to tell.” ‘War is terrible’ IDF officials granted NBC News access to an Israeli military drone base south of Tel Aviv and provided interviews with two active-duty Israeli drone pilots. Israeli officials requested that the pilots remain anonymous because the IDF considers their identities classified.   The pilots declined to discuss specific targets, but Israel's strikes in Gaza appear to be focused on two things: undermining Hamas capabilities, such as rocket launching, and killing the senior leadership of Hamas, which is more difficult because of the group’s extensive underground tunnel system. The pilots described how they try to minimize civilian casualties when they carry out strikes. They also said they were aware of the controversy surrounding Israeli air attacks. “War is terrible. It’s filled with chaos. And when the other side, Hamas, is using civilians as human shields, it makes our jobs 100 times worse,” said the first of the two pilots. “We’re an integral part of the battle and the battlefield,” the first pilot added. “We take full responsibility for anything that goes on.” The other pilot said, “Our job is to make sure that whoever needs to be eliminated is taken out exclusively and no one else.”  Mourners attend the funeral of Palestinians killed in an overnight Israeli strike on the refugee camp of Balata, east of Nablus in the West Bank, on Saturday. Jaafar Ashtiyeh / AFP - Getty Images A strike in the West Bank Drone strikes in the conflict aren’t limited to Gaza. On Saturday, NBC News visited a damaged Palestinian Authority Fatah party building in the Balata refugee camp, near Nablus, in the West Bank. The drone strike Friday appeared to have created a hole in its ceiling.  The IDF said it had targeted a “hide-out used by terrorists,” and both the IDF and residents said a member of the armed wing of Fatah was killed. Residents said five people, in all, died in the bombing. One of them was a man walking by the building, according to witnesses. Another was a 15-year-old boy who died inside it. An interview with his mother that was posted online said he was at his grandfather’s house and then went to the Fatah center before the strike occurred. “My fate,” his mother said, “was to become the mother of a martyr.” On Saturday, the bodies of the dead were covered in flags and carried through the streets by crowds of men, some masked and firing automatic weapons in the air. A mobile sound system played songs celebrating Palestinian fighters.  During the funeral, a drone could be seen flying overhead. “Even after the bombing, it’s still roaming around,” a man said. “It monitors everything in the area.” ‘I see children’ It takes two people to fly a weaponized drone: the pilot of the drone and a second person who operates the “ball,” handling the signals intelligence and imagery. IDF officials gave NBC News exclusive access to five videos showing what Israeli drone pilots saw surveilling possible targets in Gaza during the first weeks of the war.   In the videos, two IDF pilots discuss whether or not to strike. They talk about people, sometimes children, walking close enough to targets that they choose to cancel the strikes or delay them until civilians have left the area. “There are at least six or seven people wandering the area of the school wearing black. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,” an IDF pilot counts in Hebrew. The black and white video shows dark gray images that appear to be people moving on the ground below. Another IDF pilot refers to an area that comes into view and says in Hebrew, “I estimate there are 10 here at least, even 20 or 30. I am mentioning again, we think this is not within the policy.” In a second video, an IDF pilot is heard saying, “I see children right beside the building.” Later in the video, another pilot asks, “Could you show me where the children are?” The first pilot replies: “Now it’s out of our eyesight. We can’t see, but in the area that I’m marking, in that space, there are many people, including children.” At the end of the video, a pilot says: “We are leaving this target. It isn’t approved.”  One of the drone pilots interviewed by NBC News said such conversations were common. “We have to stay sharp,” he said. “That’s why we are constantly speaking about the children at the scene and whoever or whatever gets into our picture and why we have to abort airstrikes and call off airstrikes.” The principles of war U.S. Army Lt. Col. Paul Lushenko, a co-author of the forthcoming book “The Legitimacy of Drone Warfare: Evaluating Public Perceptions,” reviewed the five Israeli drone videos for NBC News. “First and foremost, this is a complicated business set against the sort of terrain that we’re operating within,” he said, referring to Gaza. “You can see how congested, contested and built-up it is.” He said international humanitarian law requires combatants to abide by the principles of distinction (between civilians and combatants), proportionality (the use of commensurate force) and military necessity (the need to achieve a legitimate military objective). The rules apply to both ground operations and airstrikes, including drone attacks.  Lushenko said drone strikes conducted by Israel have most likely resulted in civilian casualties — though probably fewer than would be caused by large bombs dropped by planes — and that the deaths may have been unintentional.   A Palestinian man carries an injured child in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, on Nov. 7. Said Khatib / AFP - Getty Images file “Make no mistake: International humanitarian law is put in place to minimize collateral damage, especially the killing of women and children,” Lushenko said. “But it doesn’t preclude it in the event that you have an overriding military objective.” Israeli ethicists, professors and experts said international humanitarian law is integrated into IDF operations: commanders’ and soldiers’ guidelines and orders, their training and real-time legal advice. “There are on-site, hands-on military attorneys who operate at every level from the Israeli chief of staff to the units that operate on the ground,” said Netta Barak-Corren, a professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem and a fellow at Princeton University. “They are there to assist the military commander by giving advice in real time about whether a specific operation is legal under international humanitarian law or not.”  The IDF’s code of ethics also includes a clause explicitly stating that members of the military will not use their weapons to harm civilians. One of the authors of the IDF code of ethics, Moshe Halbertal, an adviser to the IDF, said the code applies to drones. “Drones are operated by humans, and they have to take care while operating a drone,” said Halbertal, a professor at Hebrew University and New York University Law School. Dill, the Oxford University professor, said she worried that commanders may rely too heavily on drone strikes in order to minimize their own troop losses. They may also attempt attacks they would not conduct on the ground.    “The disadvantage is that they give commanders the notion that ... they can target anywhere, and so maybe sometimes they bring targets within reach that would otherwise not have been attacked,” she said. “The ethical and legal upside is that they allow the commander to keep their own forces out of harm’s way.” ‘War is messy’ The Israeli drone pilots acknowledged the dangers of their strikes. “I can say that war is messy, and we can train all day and all night not to hit civilians,” one said. “When it happens, we as IDF soldiers take it very hard, understanding that we have to be better next time and be more precise. And that’s what we train to do.”  The other pilot said: “Our moral code and moral high ground only takes us to some point. And it’s hard; it’s difficult. It’s unbelievably tricky.” Hajjaj, the Palestinian freelance journalist in southern Gaza, said people there fear what comes next. He said it seemed that larger targets like buildings were being hit with bombs dropped by Israeli F-16s or other planes. Drones, meanwhile, continue to circle overhead, emitting a low hum. “The noise prevents us to sleep, prevents us to speak and prevents us to hear well,” Hajjaj said.

        "description": "The head of the Jewish Community in Denmark says the number of antisemitic incidents registered since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that ignited the war in Gaza has reached levels not seen since World War II",
        "text": "The number of antisemitic incidents registered in Denmark since the Oct. 7 attack on  Israel  that ignited the war in  Gaza  has reached levels not seen since World War II, the head of the Scandinavian country's small  Jewish  community said Thursday. “We have seen the the biggest antisemitic wave in Denmark since 1943,” when Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany, Henri Goldstein, head of the 1,800-strong Jewish Community, told The Associated Press on Thursday. That was the year some 7,200 Danish Jews were evacuated to neutral Sweden to prevent their deportation to a Nazi concentration camp, leaving almost no Jews in Denmark.  The figures, compiled by the community's security organization, were on a par with reports in other European countries. Goldstein said that \"after Oct. 7, we have seen antisemitism on steroids.”  “We have seen a violent escalation, not least fueled by the uncontrolled spread of hatred on social media,” he said, adding that in 2023, “all 121 incidents were Jew-hatred - and not 'just criticism of Israel.'” Of the 121 incidents, 20 were death threats “which we have not since since the 1980s,” Goldstein said, referring to threats made then against two leading figures in the Jewish community - an editor-in-chief and the chief rabbi.  Jews in Denmark were advised not to wear Jewish symbols openly, Goldstein said. Most of the cases involved hate messages, more than half of them online. The report only mentioned known cases of antisemitism but the community said that ”the vast majority of antisemitic incidents are never reported.\"  Many European countries have registered a rise in reported antisemitic acts and comments since the outbreak of the war in Gaza.  There are currently up to 7,000 Jews in Denmark. Denmark, which was occupied by Nazi Germany from April 1940 to May 1945, was one of the few European countries whose Jewish population was largely saved from the Holocaust. About 95% of Denmark’s Jewish population managed to escape by crossing the narrow waterway from northeastern Denmark to neutral Sweden in a risky rescue mission between September and October 1943.",

        "title": "No 10 says 40% of trains must always run under new laws to limit impact of strikes to be brought in by Christmas – as it happened",
        "text": "Government aiming to limit rights of railway workers, ambulance staff and border officials to go on strike. This live blog is closed The government has announced that it intends to activate before Christmas new laws to limit the right of railway workers, ambulance staff and border officials to go on strike. Under the proposals, 40% of rail services would have to run on strike days, and border checks would have to be as “effective” on strike days as on non-strike days. And ambulance staff would have to maintain “vital” services on strike days. Earlier this year the government passed a law, the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Act, to ensure “minimum” levels of service are maintained in public services when unions go on strike. This afternoon the government said the regulations for rail workers, ambulance staff and border security staff would be laid in parliament after the state opening tomorrow. In  a statement  Rishi Sunak signalled the new rules would be in place by the end of the year. He said: We are doing everything in our power to stop unions de-railing Christmas for millions of people. This legislation will ensure more people will be able to travel to see their friends and family and get the emergency care they need. In  a summary of the new rules , the government said: For border security, the regulations will apply to employees of Border Force and selected HM Passport Office staff where passport services are required for the purposes of national security. The laws will set out that border security services should be provided at a level that means that they are no less effective than if a strike were not taking place. It will also ensure all ports and airports remain open on a strike. For train operators, it will mean the equivalent of 40% of their normal timetable can operate as normal and, in the case of strikes that affect rail infrastructure services, certain priority routes can remain open. Minimum service level regulations for ambulance workers will ensure that vital ambulance services in England will continue throughout any strike action, ensuring that cases that are life-threatening, or where there is no reasonable clinical alternative to an ambulance response, are responded to. The government is still consulting on the minimum service levels rules that it is allowed to impose under the act for other NHS staff, for teachers and for firefighters. The government has announced that it  intends to activate before Christmas new laws  to limit the right of railway workers, ambulance staff and border officials to go on strike.  (See  5.34pm .) Boris Johnson referred to Rishi Sunak’s Treasury  as “the pro-death squad”  as he sought to gain support for a gradual end to Covid restrictions, the official inquiry into the pandemic has been told. The  Metropolitan police  has released a statement urging the organisers of the planned pro-Palestinian march in London for Saturday to reconsider given that it will coincide with Armistice Day.  Ministers have been strongly signalling that they want the police to initiate the process that could lead to the march being banned. We ask organisers to consider postponing any demonstrations in  #London  this  #ArmisticeWeekend . https://t.co/wvjmAqAVi6   pic.twitter.com/58v8jD0QTV The Conservative peer Michelle Mone  has acknowledged for the first time  that she was involved with a company that was awarded government PPE contracts worth £200m during the Covid pandemic. Labour says the government, not trade unions, is to blame for the public regularly not getting minimum levels of service.  Angela Rayner,  the deputy  Labour  leader, issued this statement in response to the announcement from No 10. This government’s failed approach has led to the worst strikes in decades and now they’re getting their excuses in early for Christmas. Rishi Sunak is offering another sticking plaster to distract from the Conservatives’ track record of failure. We all want minimum standards of service and staffing but it’s Tory ministers who are consistently failing to provide them. The  TUC  says the minimimum service level rules announced by the government this afternoon (see  5.34pm ) will prove unworkable.  Paul Nowak , the TUC general secretary, said: These anti-strike laws won’t work. The crisis in our public services is of the government’s own making. Rather than engaging constructively with unions, they are attacking the right to strike. And they are punishing paramedics and rail staff for daring to stand up for decent pay and better services. These new laws are unworkable, undemocratic and almost certainly in breach of international law. The UK already has some of the most restrictive trade union laws in Europe. It is already harder for working people here to take strike action than in any other Western European country. Now the Tories want to make it even harder for people to win fair pay and conditions. Nowak said the Equality and Human Rights Commission has  raised concerns  that the act breached the European convention on human rights. The government has announced that it intends to activate before Christmas new laws to limit the right of railway workers, ambulance staff and border officials to go on strike.

At the  Covid inquiry   Warner  was asked about a message he sent to  Tom Shinner , another official working on coronavirus policy, in which they both complained about the Treasury. This was in February 2021. In the message, Warner said: I am waging my own small war against HMT [Her Majesty’s Treasury] – their culture is fucked. My new favourite line whenever they mention VFM (value for money) is ‘well, it is only X per cent of eat out to help out and probably won’t have such a terrible effect’. Asked about the comment,  Warner  said he was referring to how the Treasury managed certain topics, like advanced analytics and data. He said the comment “doesn’t necessarily reflect my entire views of what is a complex organisation”. In other respects the Treasury was “unbelievably helpful”, he said. Warner was responding to a message from Shinner, who had posted a link to this comment article published by the Guardian on 5 February 2021. In it  Sam Bowman  praised  Rishi Sunak , the then chancellor, for introducing furlough, but said that “ever since that point [he] has been the most powerful voice in government pushing for returns to ‘normal’ before time, with disastrous consequences”. Bowman concluded by saying: Sunak’s failure to push for elimination of Covid last summer, when only  0.3% of Covid tests  in the UK were returning positive results and some parts of the country had come close to  eliminating it altogether , may have contributed to tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths and hundreds of billions of pounds of lost economic output. If he has still not grasped that the only way to get back to normal is to eliminate Covid, and argues for a premature reopening that lets a vaccine-resistant variant emerge, he may be about to make the biggest mistake of his life. Commenting on the article,  Shinner  said: Depressingly I think there’s quite a lot of truth in this about Treasury approach The  Covid inquiry  has also been shown private messages exchanged between  Ben Warner , the data scientist and No 10 aide, and  Lee Cain , the PM’s communications director, in September and October 2020. They were both frustrated by the government’s failure to take action in response to the rising number of cases. At this point scientists were calling for another lockdown. “We are so fucked,” Cain wrote on 12 October. And on 30 October, the day before Boris Johnson announced a second lockdown (having resisted one for weeks),  Warner  said: I feel like we have accidentally invented a time machine. That was a reference to March 2020, when Johnson was also criticised for introducing lockdown late. The Conservative MP  Natalie Elphicke , who is normally seen as being on the right of the party, has criticised Suella Braverman’s proposal to stop charities distributing tents to homeless people. She posted this on X. In all my years of helping people who are homeless, in cities like London and Manchester as well as my own local area in Dover and Deal, at no time, ever, has anyone said the answer lies in the removal of tents. In all my years of helping people who are homeless, in cities like London and Manchester as well as my own local area in Dover and Deal, at no time, ever, has anyone said the answer lies in the removal of tents. The  Metropolitan police  have confirmed that Just Stop Oil activists did not commit any offences linked to the Cenotaph. In a statement, the Met said: Around 100 arrests were made by officers along Whitehall during another day of disruption by Just Stop Oil. These arrests were made for breaching section seven of the Public Order Act at various points between Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square, including near to the Cenotaph. No protester glued themselves to the road. There were no offences linked to the Cenotaph. Plans for further strike action at UK universities have stalled after the  University and College Union  failed to get the required turnout in its latest strike ballot. More than two thirds (68%) of UCU members at 140 universities who voted were in support of taking strike action over pay and working conditions, with 75% in favour of industrial action short of strike action. Turnout, however, was only 43%, significantly below the required 50% threshold. It follows a prolonged period of disruptive industrial action in UK universities, including a marking and assessment boycott which meant many students had to wait for their final grades this summer. The UCU general secretary,  Jo Grady , blamed anti-democratic trade union laws. She said: The national ballot results show university staff support taking action over pay and conditions. However, anti-democratic restrictions, which single out trade unions for special treatment, mean no action can take place. But Raj Jethwa, the chief executive of the  Universities and Colleges Employers Association , said: Now that the ballot is over, unions and employers need to find common ground on the issues that the sector is grappling with. For the sake of students and staff alike, it is now vital to work together to end the sector’s recent cycle of industrial disputes. Ben Warner,  the data specialist who worked in No 10 alongside Dominic Cummings during Covid, also told the inquiry this afternoon that he was concerned about the lack of scientific knowledge in the civil service. He said: Throughout the pandemic I thought that there was a lack of scientific capability within the different teams and groups that I was working with. He stressed that he was not talking about government scientists. He went on: I do think that within the, let’s call it sort of Cobra/Cabinet Office, that I was continually concerned about their understanding of what Sage were saying and how that was being translated into the documents that were produced for ministers. Here is  John Crace ’s sketch, where he imagines  Suella Braverman  making an unexpected lifestyle choice. And the inquiry has just been shown these messages to Boris Johnson from  Dominic Cummings , his chief adviser. They were sent on Saturday 14 March 2020, which is when advisers met in No 10 and realised a lockdown was required. Cummings told Johnson that, when people talked to him about the point at which Covid cases would peak in the future, they should have been telling him that they were talking about the point at which the NHS would collapse (assuming no change in policy). Ben Warner,  the data specialist who worked in No 10 alongside Dominic Cummings during Covid, is giving evidence to the inquiry this afternoon. As  Peter Walker  reports, he was asked about a line he wrote in his notebook after a meeting during the early days of the Covid crisis where he said the NHS was “fucked in any scenario”. \"NHS fucked in any scenario\" Eloquent assessment by Ben Warner in his contemporaneous notebooks from his time in No 10 about his view of planning for Covid in early 2020.  pic.twitter.com/s1wyYlwsTm And this is what  Warner  says about the comment in his witness statement to the inquiry. This is the explanation for this note that Warner gave in his witness statement to the inquiry.  pic.twitter.com/9s1sD0dZTm Olivier De Schutter , the UN’s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, told the Guardian in an interview that levels of poverty are “simply not acceptable … in a rich country such as the UK”. At the No 10 lobby briefing this morning the PM’s spokesperson said the government did not accept this. He said: We simply don’t agree. We know that households are at least £6,000 a year better off in full-time work than out on benefits. And our record on this is clear – there are 1.7 million fewer people in absolute poverty and there are almost 700,000 fewer children growing up in workless households since 2010. And we have taken unprecedented levels of support post-pandemic in response to high inflation, not least paying half of people’s energy bill.

He makes the proposal  in an article for Al Jazeera . Here is an extract. On November 2, seven UN Special Rapporteurs  said  they “remain convinced that the Palestinian people are at grave risk of genocide”. This followed the resignation of  Craig Mokhiber , the Director of the UN’s office in New York, who characterised the horrors in Gaza as a “textbook case of genocide” aimed toward “the expedited destruction of the last remnants of indigenous life in Palestine” … Genocide is a term that should be used carefully. There are many horrors in history that are hideous enough on their own terms without warranting that label. The term has a legal definition, a legal basis and legal implications. That is why, when international experts in this field warn us about genocide, we should sit up and listen. And that is why we need an immediate ceasefire, followed by an urgent investigation by the international criminal court. The ICC should not just investigate the crime of genocide, but every single war crime committed by all parties over the past month. The UK government has the authority and responsibility to call for this investigation. So far, it has refused to call out the atrocities unfolding before our very eyes.  Blackouts in Gaza  may be temporary, but impunity is permanent and our government continues to give the Israeli army the cover it needs to commit its crimes in darkness. During his evidence his morning  Stuart Glassborow , deputy principal private secretary to Boris Johnson during the pandemic, admitted that the government decided to go ahead with the “eat out to help out” subsidy scheme for restaurants in the summer of 2020 without getting scientific advice on the impact it might have on Covid transmission. Rishi Sunak, the then chancellor, was personally associated with the scheme, and he was embarrassed by  subsequent evidence  showing it had led to a rise in the number of people getting Covid. Glassborow told the inquiry that during July 2020, before the scheme was launched, he and others in No 10 “did become aware that there hadn’t been direct CMO [chief medical officer], CSA [chief scientific adviser], Sage [scientific advisory group for emergencies] analysis on this policy”. Asked if a decision was taken to persist with the scheme anyway, without scientific advice, Glassborow said: I can’t speak on behalf of all people who would have had an interest in this. I don’t recall significant representations being made to in some sense revisit the policy – that’s not to say some people didn’t have views one way or another at that time. Last week the inquiry was told that Prof Chris Whitty, the CMO, called the scheme  “eat out to help out the virus” .",

        "description": "",
        "text": "At kibbutz Nir Oz – a tranquil haven of 400 farmers until, mind-bogglingly, a quarter of the population were kidnapped by  Hamas  snatch squads – Mail photographer Roland Hoskins and I came across sights we wished we had never seen. At a home with a colourful children's play house in the garden and toddler toys everywhere, there was an upturned child's cot, right next to a large, thick pool of congealed blood. A putrid stench of death hung in the air, which was thick with buzzing flies, and I came very close to vomiting. In another kibbutz, according to witnesses, a girl of about six, a boy aged seven – kneeling, with their heads down, and their hands tied behind their back.  On the other side of the dining room table, where a family feast had been prepared, the father and mother, their rigid bodies in the same positions. It gets worse. According to rescue workers who found them, the family had been tortured. Missing fingers, and 'an eye taken out'. Each was executed with a bullet. And then the Hamas savages tucked into the Sabbath meal on the table.                           A house of horrors:  Sam Greenhill visits the kibbutz Nir Oz to witness first-hand the carnage left after Hamas's deadly attack on the peaceful farming community              Inside one home is a colourful children's play house in the garden surrounded by toddler's toys. An Israeli flag dangles down amongst the clutter             Daily Mail Chief Reporter Sam Greenhill pictured at the the scene of Kibbutz Be'eri which is 4km from the Gaza border and was attacked on Saturday, October 7 These were the final savage moments of one kibbutz family, as told by the civilian volunteers who helped recover their bodies.    \n   I have heard several horrific accounts over the past days here. And the fact that it is so shocking - after two weeks of relentlessly harrowing stories – shows how deeply this country is traumatised by the October 7 atrocity. Yossi Landau has 30 years' experience with Zaka, a civilian voluntary group whose members help ambulance crews in the identification of the victims of terrorism, road accidents and other disasters, and where necessary gather body parts for proper Jewish burials. His voice trembled as he recounted the 'bad dream' of how he and his comrades went into Be'eri kibbutz after the massacre there. Mr Landau, 55, said: 'The first house we saw was a couple, father and mother, sitting on their knees on the floor, their heads down, hands tied behind their back. On the other side of the dining room was a seven-year-old boy, and a girl, maybe six, sitting in the same position, hands tied behind the back.' Mr Landau, who has 22 grandchildren, said the bodies showed signs of torture. 'There were missing body pieces - an eye just taken out, fingers being…' His voice trailed off. 'And in the end, they all had a bullet.' Tormenting himself with the horror, he began to wonder in disjointed sentences who had been tortured first and 'if this was the children looking at the parents being tortured' or the other way round. 'And those terrorists sat and ate the Sabbath meal that was prepared for the family, eating while torturing these children.'              Hamas thugs went house to house hunting for Israeli families during their murderous assault              Sam walks n around one home, where toys, clothes and furniture was strewn all over the floor              'A putrid stench of death hung in the air, which was thick with buzzing flies, and I came very close to vomiting', wrote Sam following his experience (pictured is one of the homes)             Daily Mail Chief Reporter Sam Greenhill was told how Hamas terrorists allegedly tortured their victims - which included children and babies - before killing them  It is hard to imagine a more gut-churning scene, but Mr Landau barely paused for breath before his next hideous recollection tumbled out. 'Then we see a woman - she was about 30. She was lying on the floor, a big puddle of blood, face down. We had to turn her over in order to put her in a body bag. She was a pregnant woman. Her stomach was butchered open. 'The baby that was connected to the cord was stabbed and she was shot in the back. Did she see that? What was done to her baby? We don't know. We had a debate between us, to use two body bags, one for the baby and one for the mother? We decided to use only one because we didn't want to disconnect this baby from the mother.' It is too awful to contemplate. Is it really true? There has been no way to verify this utterly harrowing account. And it should be said that Mr Landau is a civilian, albeit a highly experienced first responder, rather than a clinician. There will be plenty of cynics claiming this is all Israeli propaganda. But last week I interviewed four of Israel's most senior forensic pathologists, who have the gruesome task of identifying the 297 most disfigured bodies. They too told me of the worst imaginable, seeing babies with no heads and the remains of children who had apparently been tied up when they were murdered. Like Mr Landau, they told of having to separate the remains of people who had been hugging tightly as they were burnt to death.             Sam (pictured in front of an upturned children's cot) said some of the atrocities were 'too awful to contemplate'             Hamas terrorists torched homes. One of the victim slaughtered was a pregnant woman who had her stomach butchered open, it was claimed (pictured the damage inside one home)             A scorched clock is pictured amongst the rubble at the kibbutz Nir Oz In his testimony, Mr Landau, who was sitting with three of his colleagues, told how in a shelter near the border town of Sderot, 'we saw 20 people who were hugging themselves, trying to defend themselves. They were all burnt to death. We had to separate them'.  And in Kfar Aza, a village just a couple of miles from the Gaza fence, as Zaka volunteers thought they had collected all the bodies after 10 days, they found another. 'Suddenly we see a body, 14 or 15. He was outside,' said Mr Landau. 'It looks like he was running and they probably got mad at him. We found him without his head. He was without a head. The evil, the horror, I don't know why this has to happen.' Nearby were 'two piles of children' aged about 10 to 15. He raged: 'They weren't even shot - they were hands tied and all burnt. Isn't that war crimes?' There are indeed compelling evidence of atrocities in all the villages I have visited in the past week.  Only the most entrenched sceptic would doubt the accounts of people such as Mr Landau and his colleagues.",

        "text": "City of David archaeology excavation of city's walls, moat   Researchers from the Israel Antiquities Authority and Tel Aviv University have uncovered fortifications that help reassess the limits of the ancient city of Jerusalem. (Israel Nature and Parks Authority)   Board games have long been a favored pastime, even thousands of years ago.          \n        \n       The ancient game called \"Hounds and Jackals,\" also called \"58 Holes,\" has long been thought to have originated in Egypt. An archaeological discovery  recently published in the European Journal of Archaeology by Walter Crist and Rahman Abdullayev suggests that the game could have different origins.      Several ancient board games dating back thousands of years have been unearthed around modern-day Azerbaijan.   (CM Dixon/Heritage Images/Getty Images)     ANCIENT PLANT LIFE UNEARTHED IN 53-MILLION-YEAR-OLD FOREST IN TASMANIA     \n        \n       Boards have been found spread across Egypt, the Levant, Mesopotamia, Iran and Anatolia, the study notes.     The  game is played on a board  covered in holes meant for the peg-shaped pieces. Players must navigate their way along the board, which is constructed of two parallel lines of tiny holes and an arc of 38 holes around them. The player who reaches the end first is declared the winner. The ancient board game operates similarly to the far more modern game \"Chutes and Ladders.\"      \n        \n       ARCHAEOLOGISTS DISCOVER UNIQUE ARTWORK IN ENGLAND DATING BACK TO THE EARLY 2ND CENTURY The new study explains that six boards were found at several different archaeological sites in modern-day Azerbaijan.      One board each was found at Çapmalı, Yenı Türkan and Dübəndi, while three boards were found at Ağdaşdüzü, per the study.          \n        \n       \"Six boards bearing this game's distinct pattern were found at sites on the Abşeron Peninsula and Gobustan Reserve in Azerbaijan. Their presence there not only indicates that the region was connected to societies to the south, but also demonstrates the game's popularity across cultures and socioeconomic groups. Its supposed first  appearance in Egypt  is questioned in favour of a south-western Asian origin,\" the study notes.      The ancient game has similar rules to the modern-day \"Chutes and Ladders.\"   (Steve Russell/Toronto Star via Getty Images) \"While much attention has focused on the origin, typology, layout, and potential rules of the fifty-eight holes game and boards, less attention has been paid to the cultural processes that influence the transmission of games between regions,\" the study further explains.  FOSSILS DATING BACK 9 MILLION YEARS UNEARTHED DURING CONSTRUCTION AT HIGH SCHOOL         \n        \n       The findings of these ancient boards suggest that the origins of the game could lie  in southwestern Asia,  dating back to the late third, early second millennium B.C.  Additionally, \"the Abşeron Peninsula's connection to exchange networks suggests that the game of fifty-eight holes spread through trade rather than conquest,\" the study states.      The discovery of these ancient boards suggests the origins of the game could lie in southwestern Asia.   (Sepia Times/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) \"Whatever the origin of the game of fifty-eight holes, it was quickly adopted and played by a wide variety of people, from the nobility of Middle Kingdom Egypt to the cattle herders of the Caucasus, and from the Old Assyrian traders in Anatolia to the workers who built Middle Kingdom pyramids,\" the study further states.     \n        \n       CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP           While this finding makes a strong case about the game's origins, the study acknowledges that more evidence is needed to fully understand where the game got its start.

        "title": "Q&A: The calls for halting arms exports to Israel and the political implications",
        "description": "The details and potential impact of growing demands for the Government to halt arms exports to Israel following the death of aid workers in Gaza.",
        "text": "The Prime Minister is under growing pressure to suspend arms sales to  Israel  after seven aid workers were killed by an air strike in  Gaza  on Monday. The victims included Britons John Chapman, James “Jim” Henderson and James Kirby, 47. Three former Supreme Court justices are among 600 legal experts who have signed a letter arguing that the  Government  is at risk of breaking international law if UK arms exports do not cease. Here the PA news agency summarises the current situation and the potential implications. – What is the significance of the letter and what does it say? The letter has been signed by 600 lawyers, legal academics and retired senior judges, including Supreme Court President Brenda Hale and former justices Jonathan Sumption and Nicholas Wilson. The scale and standing of the signatories means it can only be taken very seriously by politicians in the UK and beyond. With the Government already facing cross-party calls for action in response to the killings of the aid workers, the letter’s argument for an end to arms exports to Israel demands that the Government sets out its position in response to an emotive aspect of a broader complex and sensitive ethical and diplomatic issue. The main thrust of the 17-page letter is that the UK must act in response to the “catastrophic” situation in Gaza because the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled in a provisional judgement that there is a plausible risk of genocide being committed against Palestinians. Importantly, it accuses ministers of falling “significantly short” of their obligations under international law over the sale of weapons to Israel and the suspension of aid to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, which Israel claims has links with Hamas. – Does anyone disagree with the letter’s argument? The Israeli Government will of course defend itself against accusations of breaking international law. Elsewhere, as with any complex aspect of law, there will be different interpretations, but the high number of experts who have signed the letter gives the impression that its argument is sound. However, legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg said the letter contains a “disturbing error” in claiming the ICJ concluded that there was a plausible risk of genocide in Gaza. Mr Rozenberg notes that the words “plausible risk” do not appear in the court’s order, adding it ruled that “it is the Palestinians rights’ that were found to be plausible – not the risk they may face”. Interpretations of the ICJ order could feed into discussions over the Government’s next step, particularly in the context of the broader uncertainty surrounding the internal legal advice it has been given on whether Israel has breached international humanitarian law. – Who else is calling for action? With most MPs biding their time before commenting on the issue, some Tory figures have called on the Government to suspend arms exports to Israel. MPs who have backed the move include former minister Alan Duncan, David Jones, Flick Drummond and Paul Bristow. Notably, Lord Peter Ricketts, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron’s former national security adviser, said the UK should halt arms sales to Israel. The crossbench peer told the BBC this “would be a powerful political message, and it might just stimulate debate in the US as well, which would be the real game-changer”. The charity that the killed aid volunteers were working for, World Central Kitchen, has called for an investigation into the attack by the Israel Defence Force. Founder Jose Andres claimed the Israeli military knew his aid workers’ movements and targeted them “systematically, car by car”. The claim has been dismissed by the Israeli Government. – What is the position of  Labour  and other parties on the issue? Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy called for arms sales to be halted if there has been a “serious breach” of international law. It is likely that many in the party, including senior figures, believe official legal opinion will find this is the case, as Labour continues to call for the Government to publish its internal legal advice. Jack Straw , who blocked exports of some military equipment to Israel in 2002 when he was foreign secretary in Tony Blair’s government, told the i newspaper that all arms sales should be suspended “in concert” with European allies. The Liberal Democrats and the SNP have both called for exports to be suspended. – What must the Government consider when making a decision? Rishi Sunak has called for an independent investigation into the deaths of aid workers but stopped short of saying arms exports should end. He insisted the UK has been “consistently clear” with Israel that it must abide by international law. This is key to decisions on whether export licences are granted or maintained. Guidelines say a determination that items might be used to “commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law” is expected to lead to licenses being withdrawn, but it is the business secretary, currently Kemi Badenoch, who formally makes the final decision. – What are the domestic political implications? There will be an ongoing challenge for both Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer to maintain a united front in their parties on the issue of Gaza, but the killing of aid workers could threaten to expose further divisions. The flow of Tory figures calling for arms exports to be halted is currently no more than a trickle, with the heat taken out of the issue by the fact that MPs are still on their Easter break. This is also true for Labour, which has experienced a greater level of division on the issue. A joint appearance by Rachel Reeves and Sadiq Khan on Monday was telling in this regard. The London Mayor was happy to suggest “people suspect” the Government’s legal advice found Israel has broken international law, adding there is now “a case” for halting arms sales. In contrast,  the shadow chancellor simply repeated the party line that Labour was calling on the Government to publish its legal advice.",

Bakhmut has seen some of the most intense fighting since Russian President  Vladimir Putin  launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. However, the Eastern European country has responded with a stronger-than-expected defense effort, bolstered by Western aid, that has blunted  Russian military  gains. On Saturday, Ukrainian forces advanced on Bakhmut's southern flank, according to the ISW. Citing Russian military bloggers, the think tank reported that Ukrainian forces were able to advance along the forest line north of Klishchiivka, about 4 miles southwest of Bakhmut, which  serves as a regional hub with highways that lead to strategic cities  in the Donbas, such as Kramatorsk and Slovyansk. Russian forces continued to attack north and south of Bakhmut on Saturday, but did not make any claimed or confirmed advances.

She has spent most of her short life in an incubator in the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza.

There’s no humanity for people, for patients and for everyone,” Dr. Shireen Abed, a neonatal specialist in Gaza, told NBC News in a voice note on WhatsApp.  Hind Shamlakh, 32, almost gave birth under the rubble.  Originally from Gaza City, her family headed   south to Deir al-Balah to escape the fighting.   They were staying on the floor of a stranger’s home when the house was blown apart by an airstrike, she said. She and her young son were dug out of the debris and taken to a shelter in a nearby school. She soon began to feel acute pain.  “They found that I had blood pressure due to the amount of rubble that was on me, and the air from the bombing caused damage to me,” Hind said.

Yomiuri Shimbun via AP The mothers and newborns at Nasser Hospital are relatively fortunate, compared to those 14 miles north at  Al-Shifa , the main hospital in the Gaza Strip. Fighting is raging in the streets around Al-Shifa and the World Health Organization on Sunday declared it was “not functioning as a hospital anymore” because of the lack of electricity, running water and food. On Tuesday, the  United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  said in a report there is now just one functioning hospital remaining in northern Gaza. Follow live updates on the Israel-Hamas conflict With no power for incubators, premature babies at Al-Shifa were individually wrapped in blankets and then placed huddled together in a desperate effort to keep them warm. At least three have died already, according to the hospital.  Israel’s military said Tuesday that it was offering mobile incubators to evacuate the newborns to safety but that the offer had not been accepted. The Gaza Health Ministry, which is run by Hamas, said it was prepared to evacuate the babies to Israel or Egypt to save their lives.  Abed said the newborns would not survive unless a solution was found immediately.  “We expect all to die because they don’t have water to prepare milk for them. They don’t have electricity to provide them with warmth,” she told NBC News   in a voice note. Gaza is particularly dangerous for both new mothers and their children because there is nowhere to escape, said Andrew Weeks, a professor of international maternal health care at the University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom. “People can’t escape and they’re trapped in a place in a very small area, which is then being intensely bombed, in which supplies have been cut off, electricity has been cut off,” said Weeks, who has studied the risks of war for pregnant women.  A newborn lies in an incubator at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, Gaza.  NBC News Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis still has power and water, but staff said they were still facing shortages of basic medical supplies. They were overwhelmed by the number of new patients arriving at the hospital after fleeing south from Gaza City. Dr. Maher Khamis Sirwana, an obstetrician, said his staff members were delivering twice as many babies as usual — with more than 800 born at the hospital since Oct. 7, compared to the roughly 400 a month he would expect normally.  High levels of stress during pregnancy can lead to serious medical conditions such as high blood pressure and preterm birth, experts say.  “This war is leading to many cases where women are delivering prematurely at seven months or eight months,” Sirwana said. “And we don’t have enough room because we don’t have enough oxygen.”  Razan Ghazali, who gave birth prematurely, lies next to her newborn daughter at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, Gaza. NBC News Sirwana was standing at the bedside of Razan Ghazali, who had given birth prematurely just hours earlier. Her tiny daughter lay beside her, not yet named and her face still covered in pale amniotic fluid. Razan, 25, said she had walked for miles in one of the long lines of Palestinian civilians trying to flee Gaza City. “I saw the Israeli tanks on the way. I was terrified. I was tired. And that’s why I delivered my baby prematurely,” she said. “It’s a mercy from God that the girl and I are in good health.” The first-time mother said she had spent months collecting clothes as she excitedly awaited her daughter’s arrival. But she was forced to leave most of them behind and she and her family fled.   “All the baby clothes I prepared for her I lost,\" Razan said. “Now all I care about is finding clothes and food.”  Raf Sanchez Raf Sanchez is a foreign correspondent for NBC News.

        "description": "",
        "text": "The father of  Hamas  hostage Emily Hand said his nine-year-old daughter has 'lost a lot of weight' after she was finally reunited with her family on Saturday.  Footage shows Thomas Hand, 63, speaking of his hope that Emily - who spent her ninth birthday inside the terror tunnels of  Gaza  - will recover physically and mentally from the torment of being held captive for 50 days.  Emily's father told  The Sun : 'We got Emily back from the hands of the Gazan terrorists. 'She's lost a lot of weight from her face and body, but generally doing better than we expected.'  He added: 'We're still fighting... as they promised they would not release children without mothers but they did not ) Advertisement \n   'We will persist in doing everything in our power to bring them back home. 'We want to express our gratitude to everyone who helped and supported us during the last 50 days until Emily's return. 'We appreciate the unwavering support as we continue our efforts for the safe return of all.' Mr Hand earlier told The Mirror of his nerve-shredding wait to hug Emily again and said he would tell her: 'I love you, I love you, I love you.' He said: 'Emily is so wonderfully sweet and innocent – and I hope and pray that this awful experience will not have taken that away from her. 'I expect she'll be very angry with me to start with because you've been thinking, 'Where is Daddy? Why has Daddy not come to save me?' 'But the great thing is she cannot blame the dog at all – and I'm absolutely sure the dog will get the cuddle first before me. 'She really is a special girl who loves everything in this world – even the big snails that crawl around our kibbutz. Emily used to put them on her arms and hands and stroke them gently. 'I'm sure we'll be able eventually to cure all the physical problems that may be inflicted on her… but the things in the mind are gonna take much more time and effort.'",

        "description": "Ukraine warns of \"big risk\" in losing the war with Russia if the debated U.S. assistance is postponed. Key insights on the urgent need for support",
        "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff said on Tuesday that the postponement of U.S. assistance for Kyiv being debated in Congress would create a “big risk\" of Ukraine losing the war with Russia. The remarks by Andriy Yermak were some of the frankest yet from a senior Kyiv official as uncertainty swirls over the future of vital U.S and European Union assistance packages as Ukraine’s war with Russia rages on. If the aid is postponed, “it gives the big risk that we can be in the same position to which we’re located now,\" he said, addressing the audience in English. “And of course, it makes this very high possibility impossible to continually liberate and give the big risk to lose this war.\" On Monday, White House officials said the U.S. was running out of time and money to help Ukraine fight its war against Russia. President Joe Biden’s administration asked Congress in October for nearly $106 billion to fund ambitious plans for Ukraine, Israel and U.S. border security but Republicans who control the House with a slim majority rejected the package. U.S. officials hope they can still get a significant package approved. Yermak singled out the threat of no more direct budgetary support as a problem. The Ukrainian government expects to have a $43 billion budget deficit next year. “Of course, without this direct budget support, it will be difficult to keep … in (the) same positions and… for the people to really survive…during the situation when the war will continue,\" he said. “That is why it is extremely critically important that this support will be voted and will be voted as soon as possible.\" Yermak was making his second visit to Washington in a matter of weeks. He said he planned to press lawmakers and administration officials on the critical importance that Congress approve the new aid package. Ukraine conducted a major counteroffensive push this year, but was unable to break through Russian defensive lines. Russia is now on the offensive in the east. Yermak said that Kyiv had a plan for the next year. “We really have a plan and this plan…includes the military operations…includes diplomatic activity and of course it includes our cooperation in the communications and information,\" he said.",

        "title": "Middle East crisis: Netanyahu’s office says meeting with Blinken was ‘positive’ – as it happened",
        "text": "Israeli prime minister says meeting with US secretary of state was ‘conducted in good spirit’ as Blinken says latest push for ceasefire is last opportunity Benjamin Netanyahu’s  three-hour meeting with  Antony Blinken  was “positive and conducted in a good spirit”, according to a statement from the Israeli prime minister’s office. “The prime minister reiterated Israel’s commitment to the latest American proposal regarding the release of our hostages — taking into account Israel’s security needs, which he insists on firmly,” Netanyahu’s office said. The Israeli army said Monday that one of its soldiers was killed in the country’s north, where cross-border fire with Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has soared during the 10-month-old Gaza war. Benjamin Netanyahu’s  three-hour meeting with  Antony Blinken  was “positive and conducted in a good spirit”, according to a statement from the Israeli prime minister’s office. Blinken  said in Tel Aviv now is “probably the best, maybe the last” opportunity to get the hostages home and to get a ceasefire. Lebanese group  Hezbollah  said on Monday that two of its fighters were killed and claimed attacks on northern  Israel , including with drones, in the latest cross-border violence amid fears of full-blown war. The armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility on Monday for a bomb blast near a synagogue in Tel Aviv that Israeli police and the Shin Bet intelligence agency described as a terrorist attack. The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza has said there have now been 40,139 Palestinians killed and 92,743 injured in Israel’s millitary offensive on Gaza since October 7. Top US diplomat Antony Blinken spoke to Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant after he met one-on-one with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for 2 and a half hours on Monday. Blinken will travel to Egypt on Tuesday for meetings in the Mediterranean city of el-Alamein after he wraps up his Israel stop. Mediators will meet again this week in Cairo to try to cement a ceasefire. The Israeli government has released footage of a person who it claims is the bomber who detonated explosives in Tel Aviv. “Fortunately, only one person sustained moderate injuries when the bomb the terrorist was carrying detonated in his backpack, killing him instantly”, it said in a statement. It said Israeli security agencies continue to maintain heightened security measures following the incident, which involved a “powerful explosive”. Hamas has claimed responsibility for an attempted terror attack in Tel Aviv earlier this week involving a powerful explosive. Fortunately, only one person sustained moderate injuries when the bomb the terrorist was carrying detonated in his backpack, killing him instantly.…  pic.twitter.com/1CXw7NYEQi A bomber in Tel Aviv failed to reach a more populated area because his explosives detonated, the Israeli government spokesman has commented. Israeli police and the Shin Bet intelligence agency described the bomb blast near a synagogue in the city as a terrorist attack. The armed wings of  Hamas  and Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility on Monday. Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said the man was carrying a backpack loaded with explosives that detonated “before he managed to reach a more heavily populated area”. Claims of Palestinians being tortured, left untreated in hospital and unable to escape constant bombardment have been submitted to the high court in London by lawyers seeking an order preventing the UK government continuing to grant arms export licences to British companies selling arms to  Israel . The 14 witness statements covering more than 100 pages come from Palestinian and western medical doctors working in Gaza’s hospitals, as well as from ambulance drivers, civil defence department workers and aid workers. The graphic evidence is designed to support a request for a court order that the UK government has acted irrationally in  refusing to ban the sale of arms , arguing there was not a clear risk the weapons would be used to commit breaches of international humanitarian law. This is the statutory test set for the government to decide whether to grant arms export licences. The Labour government is reviewing the policy. Read more here: Israel is “flagrantly and regularly” committing war crimes in Gaza, according to a former British diplomat  who recently resigned  over ministers’ failure to ban arms sales to Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. Mark Smith, who resigned as a counter-terrorism official at the British embassy in Dublin after raising complaints about the sale of British weapons to  Israel , told the BBC on Monday that he believed Israel to be in breach of international law. Smith told Radio 4’s Today programme: “When you look at what constitutes a war crime, it’s actually quite clear, even from what you see in open source on the TV, that the state of  Israel  is perpetrating war crimes in plain sight. “Anybody who has a kind of basic understanding of these things can see that there are war crimes being committed, not once, not twice, not a few times, but quite flagrantly and openly and regularly.” Read the full report here: The Israeli army said Monday that one of its soldiers was killed in the country’s north, where cross-border fire with Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has soared during the 10-month-old Gaza war. Mahmood Amaria, a 45-year-old member of the Bedouin Trackers Unit, “fell during combat in northern Israel”, a military statement said. In  Gaza , a mother worries that her month-old son, Mohammed, could be infected with polio after the Palestinian health ministry confirmed the first case in the enclave on Friday, ending a 25 year period in which the Strip was polio-free. Just three days after his birth, Ghada al-Ghandour’s son Mohammed started developing skin rashes. “He had skin rashes as if he was burnt,” she told Reuters. A doctor told her there were no creams to treat her child. She later brought him to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza to seek a diagnosis and treatment. The rash fueled his mother’s fears that other symptoms and diseases could follow due to a lack of hygiene and medical supplies in Gaza after more than 10 months of conflict. The Israeli military said a soldier was killed on Monday and another severely wounded in northern  Israel , a region that has come under near-daily rocket and drone attack from Hezbollah militants based in Lebanon. The military said it had successfully intercepted multiple drone strikes on Israel’s north near the border with Lebanon, but that some of the drones had landed in the northern region of Ya’ara. Benjamin Netanyahu’s  three-hour meeting with  Antony Blinken  was “positive and conducted in a good spirit”, according to a statement from the Israeli prime minister’s office. “The prime minister reiterated Israel’s commitment to the latest American proposal regarding the release of our hostages — taking into account Israel’s security needs, which he insists on firmly,” Netanyahu’s office said. Lebanese group  Hezbollah  said on Monday that two of its fighters were killed and claimed attacks on northern  Israel , including with drones, in the latest cross-border violence amid fears of full-blown war. We had earlier ( see post at 09.24BST ) reported Lebanon’s health ministry saying that an Israeli strike killed two people in south Lebanon on Monday in the border village of Hula but without giving further details of their identities. Now Agence France-Presse have reported Hezbollah said two of its fighters were “martyred on the road to Jerusalem”, the phrase the Iran-backed group has used to refer to members killed by Israeli fire since October. The Israeli military said air forces struck “Hezbollah terrorists” in the Hula area and “Hezbollah military structures” elsewhere in south Lebanon. Lebanon’s official National News Agency (NNA) reported Israeli shelling and raids on several southern areas, and said “enemy warplanes broke the sound barrier twice over Beirut and its suburbs... at low altitude”. Hezbollah said it launched a “simultaneous air attack” with “explosive-laden drones” on two Israeli military positions - the Yaara barracks near the border, and a base near the coastal town of Acre, around 15 kilometres (10 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said in a statement that “multiple suspicious aerial targets were identified crossing from Lebanon”. Air defences “intercepted some of the targets, and others fell” in the Yaara area, the statement added. Police in Istanbul  have launched a large-scale investigation after a Palestinian was killed and two others were wounded in a shooting as they sat in a car, officials and media said Monday. \n The killer dropped a handgun fitted with a silencer at the scene, the Istanbul governor’s office said in a brief statement, according to Associated Press. \n The Demiroren news agency reported that the man sitting in the driver’s seat was killed and his friend seriously wounded in the shooting late Sunday. Another man, who the governor’s office described as the dead man’s bodyguard, was injured in the foot. \n The identities of the victims were not disclosed beyond their initials. But the apparently professional nature of the attack led to widespread speculation in the Turkish media over whether  Israel  may have been involved. It was also suggested that the shooting may be related to business debts. \n Turkey has for years provided haven for Hamas officials. In December, the head of Israel’s Shin Bet security agency said that his organisation was prepared to target Hamas anywhere, including in Turkey. Claims of Palestinians being tortured, left untreated in hospital and unable to escape constant bombardment have been submitted to the high court in London by lawyers seeking an order preventing the UK government continuing to grant arms export licences to British companies selling arms to  Israel .

        "title": "Ballot box binge: Votes loom in coming days from Mongolia to Iran to Britain in a busy election year",
        "text": "Even in a busy year of elections around the world, the next few days stand out. Over the next week, voters go to the polls in fledgling democracies like Mauritania and Mongolia, the Islamic Republic of Iran and in stalwart democracies — former imperial powers — Britain and France. In the U.S., President Joe Biden and his predecessor Donald Trump were participating Thursday in  the first of two TV debates  before their expected November standoff. The voters in the upcoming elections face hard choices that could reorient the world at a time of war in Europe, the Middle East and Africa; mutual suspicion among some big powers; and growing public anxiety over things like jobs, climate change,  taxes , inflation and the rise of AI.  National elections are taking place in  more than 50 countries  this year.  India ,  Mexico  and  South Africa  ushered in political change or ballot-box surprises.  Russia  did not. Here’s a look at the flurry of balloting over the next few days in countries that collectively hold some 225 million people in Europe, Africa and Asia: \n    \n     Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024 The year will test even the most robust democracies.  Read more on what’s to come here . Take a look at the  25 places where a change in leadership could resonate  around the world. Keep track of the  latest AP elections coverage  from around the world here. \n    \n \n Iran In  Iran  on Friday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is looking for a successor for his hard-line protégé, President Ebrahim Raisi, who died last month in a  helicopter crash .  Two hard-liners — former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili and parliamentary speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf — are among candidates that include Masoud Pezeshkian, a cardiac surgeon seen as a reformist who has lined up with supporters of relatively moderate former President Hassan Rouhani. Amid signs of widespread voter apathy, Khamenei has called for maximum turnout and has  issued a veiled warning to Pezeshkian and his allies  about relying on the U.S.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Iran has faced economic woes in part due to international sanctions after Trump in 2018 shredded  Iran’s nuclear accord struck three earlier with world powers.  Iran has since ramped up enrichment of uranium and now  has enough to be able to produce several nuclear weapons .  \n     \n\n The Islamic Republic has sought to position itself as a leader of Muslim-world resentment against the West and Israel, which Iran  directly attacked for the first time  this year. For years, Iran has backed an array of militant groups, including the Palestinian Hamas, Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthi rebels. France France wasn’t supposed to be holding national elections this year.  But a drubbing for his pro-business, moderate party in EU elections this month led President Emmanuel Macron to  dissolve the National Assembly  and  call snap parliamentary elections , which will take place in two rounds on the next two Sundays. The result could send the nuclear-armed nation into uncharted political territory at a turbulent time for Europe: A victory of the anti-immigration National Rally party could produce France’s first far-right government since the Nazi occupation in World War II.  National Rally placed first among French parties in the EU vote, and polls suggest it could reap the single largest bloc of seats in the Assembly. If it wins an outright majority, it could name 28-year-old party President  Jordan Bardella as prime minister . \n     \n\n Macron, whose term ends in 2027, would retain his job but have to share power with a party with historical links to racism and antisemitism that is firmly opposed to many of his positions, including on military support for Ukraine. The outcome of the French vote remains very uncertain because of the complex two-round system and alliances that parties could form between the two rounds. The United Kingdom Western Europe’s other nuclear-armed power, Britain, will hold parliamentary elections next Thursday. Like their cross-Channel neighbors in France, Britons appear ready to oust the ruling party: Polls suggest the Conservatives are headed for a historic defeat in the House of Commons after 14 years in power. On Wednesday, Conservative  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak  and  Labour Party leader Keir Starmer  struggled to  get their messages  across protesters drowned out their answers at the start of a heated TV debate. They traded zingers and barbs on issues of ethics, tax and migration. \n     \n\n Britain, under the Tories, has been one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine in its national defense against Russia, and a possible Labour government isn’t expected to waver on such backing for Kyiv. Starmer may be inclined to mend Britain’s relationship with the EU after Brexit more than four years ago, but he has been adamant that a Labour government would not seek to reverse the will of the people in the referendum. \n     \n\n Mauritania Nearly 2 million people go to the polls Saturday in Mauritania, a vast desert nation in West Africa that positions itself as a strategic ally of the West but has been denounced for rights abuses. President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, a former army chief who rose to power in the country’s first democratic transition in 2019, faces seven rivals. Among them are Biram Dah Abeid, an anti-slavery activist and third-time candidate, and several opposition party leaders as well as a neurosurgeon. One of the most stable countries in Africa’s arid Sahel region, Mauritania has seen some of its neighbors shaken by military coups and jihadist violence.  The European Union this year  announced funding  to help Mauritania crack down on people smugglers and deter migrants from embarking on dangerous Atlantic crossings from West Africa to Europe — the number of which has been rising sharply — and patrol its border with restive  Mali . In the 1980s, Mauritania became the world’s last country to outlaw slavery. But nearly 150,000 people — in a country of under 5 million — remain affected by modern slavery, according to the 2023 Global Slavery Index. Mongolia  Also on Friday is the vote  for parliament in Mongolia , a country of 3.4 million people that emerged from some six decades of communist rule to become a democracy in 1990, and is wedged between two much larger authoritarian states: Russia and China. Voters will choose representatives to a body that has been expanded to 126 seats, 50 more than in the current legislature.  The ruling Mongolian People’s Party, which ran the country during the communist era but has transformed into a left-leaning centrist one, is favored to win. But other parties could make gains, possibly even enough to force the People’s Party to form a coalition government with the Democratic Party or the HUN Party, an emerging player in Mongolian politics.  Discontent with the government has been fueled by accusations of corruption and  large protests  broke out two years ago. The Mongolian government has sought to  maintain ties  with China and Russia while also building new ones with the U.S. and  its democratic allies  — a delicate task since the two sides are increasingly at odds. ___ Associated Press writers Ken Moritsugu in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Monika Pronczuk in Dakar, Senegal; Angela Charlton in Paris and Danica Kirka in London contributed to this report.",

        "title": "The White House says it's concerned Iran may provide ballistic missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine",
        "description": "The White House says it's very concerned that Iran may provide ballistic missiles to Russia for use in the war against Ukraine",
        "text": "The  White House  voiced concern Tuesday that  Iran  may provide  Russia  with ballistic missiles for use in its war against Ukraine, a development that likely would be disastrous for the Ukrainian people, a U.S. national security official said.  National Security Council spokesperson  John Kirby  noted that Iran already has been providing Russia with unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, guided aerial bombs and artillery ammunition, and may be preparing “to go a step further in its support for Russia.” Kirby highlighted a September meeting in which Iran hosted Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to show off a range of ballistic missile systems, sparking U.S. concern. “We are therefore concerned that Iran is considering providing Russia with ballistic missiles now for use in Ukraine,” Kirby told reporters during a conference call. “In return for that support, Russia has been offering Tehran unprecedented defense cooperation, including on missiles, electronics and air defense.” Kirby's warning came as President Joe Biden's request for more than $61 billion in emergency U.S. funding to continue to support Ukraine's defense remained stalled in Congress. The additional aid for Ukraine is part of a larger $106 billion funding request from the Democratic president that also would support Israel, Taiwan and the U.S. operations on the border with Mexico.  A growing group of lawmakers in the Republican Party, which controls the House of Representatives, opposes sending more money to Ukraine.  Kirby and other top U.S. officials have been urging Congress pass aid for Ukraine, saying existing funding is drying up.  He also noted Iran's announcement earlier this year that it had finalized a deal to buy Su-35 fighter jets from Russia, and said Iran is looking to buy additional military equipment from Russia, including attack helicopters, radars and combat-trainer aircraft.  “In total, Iran is seeking billions of dollars worth of military equipment from Russia to strengthen its military capabilities,\" Kirby said. “Russia has also been helping Iran develop and maintain its satellite collection capabilities and other space-based programs.” At the direction of the Russian government, Kirby said the Wagner mercenary group was preparing to provide an air-defense capability to either Hezbollah or Iran. He said the U.S. would be watching to see whether that happens and was prepared to use “counterterrorism sanctions authority against Russian individuals or entities that might make these destabilizing transfers.” The U.S. says the Kremlin’s reliance on Iran, as well as North Korea — countries largely isolated on the international stage for their nuclear programs and human rights records — shows desperation. That comes in the face of Ukrainian resistance and the success of the global coalition in disrupting Russian military supply chains and denying replacements for weapons lost on the battlefield. The White House has said Russia has turned to North Korea for artillery. U.S. officials say Iran has also provided Russia with artillery and tank rounds for its invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. and other countries have taken steps to thwart the potential supply, sale or transfer involving Iran and ballistic missile-related items, Kirby said. The U.S. has also issued guidance to private companies about Iranian missile procurement practices to make sure they aren't inadvertently supporting Iran's development efforts.  Last May, the White House said Russia was interested in buying additional advanced attack drones from Iran for use in the war against Ukraine after it used up most of the 400 drones it had previously purchased from Tehran. A U.S. intelligence finding released in June asserted that Iran was providing Russia with materials to build a drone manufacturing plant east of Moscow as the Kremlin looks to lock in a steady supply of weaponry for the war.",

The war has continued for over eight months resulting in thousands of deaths on both sides and causing severe destruction. Despite several attempts of ceasefire by other countries-international agencies and internal protests, Israel continues to conduct airstrikes in the name of eliminating Hamas terrorists. In a latest update with respect to the war, Muhammed Salah, a Hamas terrorist and key operative of the weapons manufacturing headquarters of the terrorist organisation has been killed in an Israeli airstrike, following Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) intelligence.  \n             Key Hamas Terrorist Eliminated In Israeli Airstrike As mentioned earlier, Israel eliminated terrorist Muhammad Salah, who was responsible for projects and development in Hamas’ Weapons Manufacturing Headquarters, the Israel Defence Forces said on Monday. The operation by Israeli Air Force came following IDF intelligence. In an official post shared on social media platform ‘X’ (formerly known as Twitter), the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) said, “Last night, Air Force aircraft, under the direction of Amman and the Southern Command, killed the terrorist Muhammad Salah, who was involved in projects and development at the production headquarters of the terrorist organization Hamas.” \n אמש, כלי-טיס של חיל-האוויר חיסלו בהכוונת אמ”ן ופיקוד הדרום, את המחבל מחמד צלאח, שעסק בפרויקטים ופיתוח במטה הייצור של ארגון הטרור חמאס. \nצלאח לקח חלק בפרויקט פיתוח אמצעי לחימה אסטרטגיים עבור ארגון הטרור חמאס, ופיקד על מספר חוליות מחבלים בארגון שעסקו בפיתוח אמל״ח. \n כמו כן, מטוסי…  pic.twitter.com/ibbXrmGvUA \n — Israeli Air Force (@IAFsite)  June 24, 2024 Who Was Muhammed Salah, Hamas Terrorist Killed In Airstrike? In the same social media post, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have also elaborated on who Muhammed Salah is. The post reads, “Salah took part in a project to develop strategic weapons for the terrorist organization Hamas, and commanded several terrorist squads in the organization that were engaged in the development of IML.” The forces further said, “Also, fighter jets and aircraft attacked many terrorist targets in the Gaza Strip, including tunnel shafts, armed terrorist squads and other terrorist infrastructures.” \n             \n           Israel Continues Attacks To ‘Eliminate Terrorists Who Pose A Threat’ In another news, the IDF are carrying out the “intelligence-based, targeted operations” in the Rafah area, and during targeted raids, large amounts of weapons was located by the troops.

In addition, over the past day, IDF troops eliminated a number of armed terrorists who posed a threat to them, and the troops dismantled several tunnel shafts in the Rafah area. IDF troops are continuing their operational activity in central Gaza. They have identified several terrorists who were operating in the area and eliminated them in a drone strike. The Israeli Air Force also struck numerous terror targets in the Gaza Strip, including tunnel shafts, armed terrorist squads, and additional terrorist infrastructure, the statement added. ‘War Will Not End…’ Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday, that Israel is prepared to pause the ongoing fight, in exchange for a partial deal for the return of hostages in Gaza, but the “war will not end” until Hamas is destroyed, according to The Times of Israel. Netanyahu added that as Israel gets ready for a possible all-out war with Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which has been stepping up its cross-border strikes on Israel, the intense battle phase in the Gaza Strip is also winding down.

        "title": "How much trouble is Keir Starmer in over Middle East stance?",
        "text": "On the horror in the Middle East, and in particular whether there should be a ceasefire in Israel's bombardment of Gaza, the prime minister and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer have the same position. Israel has a right to defend itself, they argue, and neither use the word \"ceasefire\". The Scottish National Party has a different position: they do advocate a ceasefire. Sir Keir, alongside the prime minister, is arguing there should be \"humanitarian pauses\" to allow aid into Gaza and people out. But that is not the same as a ceasefire, even though it would involve the firing ceasing for some period of time.  There is a growing sense of discomfort, and in some instances anger, within the Labour movement about Sir Keir's position. It is seen by some as too pro-Israel a position, with insufficient expression of concern for the Palestinians.  One hundred and fifty Muslim Labour councillors have written to Sir Keir saying he should call for an immediate ceasefire. By our calculations 19 Labour councillors have resigned from the party over this. It is worth putting that in perspective: there are about 6,500 Labour councillors across the country. And 37 Labour MPs have also said publicly they want a ceasefire. Sir Keir is trying to calm things down - meeting people within the party virtually and in person, acknowledging differences of opinion and listening. Or, to put it bluntly: trying not to make a difficult situation worse. An  interview he did  a few weeks back on LBC definitely made things worse for him. When asked if it was appropriate for Israel to cut off water and power to Gaza, he said: \"I think Israel does have that right.\"  He has since claimed what he meant to say was Israel had a right to defend itself.  Sir Keir now appears to be doing all he can to reassure rather than provoke members of his own party.  He has met around a dozen Muslim Labour MPs to hear their concerns. He  later said ,  external  \"it is clear that the amount of essential aid and utilities getting into Gaza is completely insufficient\".  Those close to the Labour leader say it is essential he acts as he would as prime minister - and this is what we are seeing. And conflict in the Middle East always provokes extremely strong reactions - which he is listening to. Follow live:  Latest updates Explained:  What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now? History behind the story:  The Israel-Palestinian conflict Hostages:  Who are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel? Bowen:  Israelis and Palestinians fear worst is yet to come One senior figure told me Labour had to be unequivocal \"about terrorism from Hamas, just as we'd expect it from allies if it happened here\".  They added that having done that Keir Starmer now needed to work out how he calibrated his position with what was happening in the region.  \"Can Labour really carry on not calling for a ceasefire, even if Israel go in and totally flatten Gaza?\" they asked. Another longstanding figure in the party wondered if Keir Starmer had given adequate thought at the outset to how things might change and how exposed that could leave him. And how scrupulously careful he had to be with his language every time he said anything on the topic.  There are whispers around Westminster about whether any shadow ministers may resign over this. Let's see. And where does all this leave support for Labour in places with a greater affinity with the Palestinians than there may be elsewhere, particularly towns and cities with significant Muslim populations? This is a test of leadership for Sir Keir. And one where the current fissure in the Labour movement could yet widen as the conflict in the Middle East escalates.",

        "title": "Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters stage sit-in demonstration in King's Cross Station and demand ceasefire for Gaza amid Israeli bombardment - as police arrest two demonstrators after protest was banned",
        "description": "",
        "text": "Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters on Friday staged a demonstration at  London 's King's Cross Station to call for a ceasefire. It came amid a devastating bombardment and siege of  Gaza  in retaliation for the October 7 attacks on southern  Israel  by  Hamas . British Transport Police last night confirmed two arrests had been made for 'failure to comply with a Section 14 notice' - prohibiting the planned protest. The  Transport Secretary  cited a risk to train services in the decision to ban the event and said all in attendance would be subject to arrest. Video  shared  on X, formerly known as  Twitter , appeared to show police arresting protesters congregating in the station on Friday night. A little before 7pm, individuals purportedly at the sit-in  said  they had been moved outside by the police - and were continuing to demonstrate on the streets.                                         Pro-Palestine protesters perform a sit in at Kings Cross station on Friday evening as part of an ongoing series of demonstrations calling for a ceasefire in the Israel/Hamas conflict             Pro-Palestine protesters perform a sit in at Kings Cross station on Friday evening as part of an ongoing series of demonstrations calling for a ceasefire in the Israel/Hamas conflict             The protest came despite the Transport Secretary's attempt to ban it, citing disruption risk              Protesters were seen with flags in the station before the demonstration was moved outside One video posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, appears to show a man draped in a Palestinian flag shouting 'free, free Palestine' while being carried away from the station by three officers. Others appear to show the controversial slogan 'from the river to the sea' being shouted with demonstrators replying 'Palestine will be free'.    \n   In videos, protesters can be seen sitting on the station concourse chanting 'ceasefire now', 'free, free Palestine' and 'in our thousands, in our millions, we are all Palestinians'. Some  chanted  'let him go!' as one was detained by police.  A banner accusing Israel of genocide can also be seen in some clips. Lukas Slothuus, 33, an academic from London who attended the sit-in, told the PA news agency: 'Over 11,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel and everyone should protest whenever they can at our government's complicity with the catastrophe Israel is causing. 'The protest was huge, with many hundreds of Londoners, and it shows the popular opinion in support of calling for a ceasefire.' On X, a Novara Media journalist claiming to be at the station  reported : 'I've just got to King's Cross, and police are handing out printed notices telling people to move - despite the fact that protesters aren't disrupting anything.' Ms Hymer shared what she said was a notice from police calling on protesters to move on. It said there was in place, from 5pm to 11pm, 'an order prohibiting the holding of a trespassory assembly'. It banned members of the public from 'gathering in groups of 20 or more with the intent to cause serious disruption to the provision of railway services or serious disruption to life of the community. 'A person who organises or takes part in an assembly the holding of which he knows is prohibited by an order under section 14A is guilty of an offence.'  Another user  replied : 'Seems like a welcome shift in policing these intimidating protests. At last.' Commenting on this evening's protest at Kings Cross Station, Transport Secretary Mark Harper said: 'While the right to peaceful protest is a key part of our democratic society, it cannot be at the expense of other people's right not to be seriously disrupted or intimidated. 'That's why I have granted consent for the British Transport Police to make an order under Section 14A of the Public Order Act 1986 prohibiting the planned protest at Kings Cross Station this evening. This means protest activity at the station is classified as unlawful and anyone taking part will be subject to arrest. 'Officers must have the powers they need for our stations to remain safe places for people to go about their journeys, protecting public safety and preventing disorder.' The Metropolitan Police this evening confirmed to MailOnline that some 100 officers were supporting the British Transport Police in managing the situation at King's Cross. British Transport Police confirmed just after 7:20pm that the protest in the station had ended and a small group had moved outside. 'Passengers can access the station as normal and trains are not disrupted,' a statement read. Earlier this evening, Sean O'Callaghan, assistant chief constable with the British Transport Police, said: 'We fully respect the rights of people to protest lawfully but where we believe this could cause serious disruption to railway services, we must take action...' 'We continue to work closely with our partners to manage the impact of protests for those who travel on the railways.'  The protest came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier today ruled out a temporary ceasefire in Gaza until hostages are released. More than 200 were reportedly taken after Hamas - the de facto governing authority in Gaza - swept into Southern Israel and attacked civilians and military personnel. Israel has responded with a siege of Gaza and made repeated raids into the beleaguered territory. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have also been condemned for attacks on civilian areas and strikes killing combatants - as well as the alleged use of White Phosphorous on the civilian population.                Today, the Israeli military confirmed it targeted an ambulance outside Gaza's largest hospital. The IDF claimed it was being used by Hamas militants while health officials said it was transporting the wounded. Israeli 'aircraft struck an ambulance that was identified by forces as being used by a Hamas terrorist cell in close proximity to their position in the battle zone,' a military statement said.  World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was 'utterly shocked' by a deadly Israeli strike on an ambulance near Gaza's largest hospital on Friday. Ghebreyesus said he was 'utterly shocked by reports of attacks on ambulances evacuating patients close to Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza, leading to deaths, injuries and damage'. 'We reiterate: patients, health workers, facilities and ambulances must be protected at all times. Always,' the WHO chief wrote on X, formerly Twitter. As the war rages on, calls have increasingly come from outside of the southern Levant to arrange a ceasefire.  Qatari mediators are among those working to agree terms, including the release of hostages. A number of captives have been freed by Hamas in recent weeks - and Israel has allowed some humanitarian aid to enter the Strip via the southern border with Egypt.              Protesters called for a ceasefire amid Israel's devastating bombardment of the Gaza Strip             Pro-Palestine protesters perform a sit in at Kings Cross station on Friday evening as part of an ongoing series of demonstrations calling for a ceasefire in the Israel/Hamas conflict             The protests comes despite a ban by the Transport Secretary , who cited a risk to train services in the decision Only on Tuesday, demonstrators  locked down London's Liverpool Street Station  with a similar protest. Pictures and videos posted on X shows the crowd of protesters chanting, cheering and clapping. Many were waving large Palestinian flags inside the station. Demonstrators could also be heard shouting: 'Palestine will be free.' At the protest on Tuesday, Hundreds of campaigners chanted: 'What do we want? Ceasefire. When do we want it? Now.' Police officers were filmed attempting to move commuters along as curious onlookers stopped to see what was happening at the sit-down protest. Sisters Uncut, a feminist group who organised the protest, posted on X: 'Sit-in taking over Liverpool Street Station in solidarity with the Palestinian people - no business as usual until genocide ends. Ceasefire now.'",

        "title": "Jeremy Corbyn calls Hamas ‘terrorist group’ after previous demurral",
        "text": "Former Labour leader argues Hamas and Israel both guilty of targeting civilians, after he avoided term in TV interview Jeremy Corbyn has described Hamas as a “terrorist group” in a magazine article after repeatedly refusing to use the term in a television interview earlier this week. The former Labour leader has written an article accusing the Israeli army of being guilty of “acts of terror too”, arguing that the comparison was necessary because Israel had killed thousands of children in strikes on  Gaza  in retaliation for Hamas’s attacks. His opinion piece in the leftwing Tribune magazine comes a day after the leader of the opposition, Keir Starmer,  said Corbyn’s “days as a Labour MP” were over  after the MP had repeatedly declined to call Hamas a terrorist organisation in an interview with Piers Morgan. Corbyn wrote that he “deplore[d] the targeting of all civilians”, including Hamas’s killing of about 1,200 people in Israel on 7 October. The MP for Islington North added: “If we understand terrorism to describe the indiscriminate killing of civilians, in breach of international law, then of course Hamas is a terrorist group. “The targeting of hospitals, refugee camps and so-called safe zones by the Israeli army are acts of terror too; and the killing of more than 11,000 people, half of whom are children, cannot possibly be understood as acts of self-defence. “We should not entertain questions from those who have no interest in applying this basic consistency.” Hamas is designated as a terror group in the UK, as well as in the US and the EU, and support for them is banned. More than  11,400 Palestinians have been killed in the war , two-thirds of them women and minors, according to Palestinian health authorities. Corbyn avoided giving a direct answer when repeatedly asked whether Hamas is a terror group by Morgan on his TalkTV show on Monday. In his Tribune article, he wrote: “Ultimately, we do not just have a responsibility to end the bloodshed. “We have a responsibility to stop bloodthirsty voices from dictating the terms of debate, and to push back against cynical attempts to distract us from our urgent goal: bringing about an immediate ceasefire.” Starmer, who had already  stripped Corbyn of the whip  in 2020 over his response to the equalities watchdog report on antisemitism in the party during his tenure as leader, had said his predecessor would not stand as a Labour MP at a future election after his refusal to call Hamas a terrorist group. The Labour leader told the News Agents podcast: “He won’t stand as a Labour MP at the next election or any election. “His days as a Labour MP are over. We have a changed party.”",

        "title": "Palestinians hope a vote in the UN General Assembly will show wide support for a Gaza cease-fire",
        "text": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The Palestinians are hoping that a vote Tuesday in the U.N. General Assembly on a nonbinding resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian cease-fire will demonstrate widespread global support for ending the  Israel-Hamas war,  now in its third month. After  the United States vetoed a resolution  in the Security Council on Friday demanding a humanitarian cease-fire, Arab and Islamic nations called for an emergency session of the 193-member General Assembly on Tuesday afternoon to vote on a resolution making the same demand. Unlike Security Council resolutions, General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding. But as U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said Monday, the assembly’s messages “are also very important” and reflect world opinion. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, told The Associated Press on Sunday that the defeated resolution in the Security Council was cosponsored by 103 countries, and he is hoping for more cosponsors and a high vote for the General Assembly resolution on Tuesday. \n     \n\n In the first U.N. response to the Gaza war, the General Assembly on Oct. 27 called for a “humanitarian truce” in Gaza leading to a cessation of hostilities. The vote was 120-14 with 45 abstentions. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n             \n                 \n                    Related stories\n                 \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Middle East latest: Gaza war deaths pass 46,000 and Lebanon ends presidential deadlock \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                    \n                    \n                       \n                 \n             \n            \n             \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Body of an Israeli hostage is found in Gaza, possibly alongside his son’s remains, army says \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                    \n                    \n                       \n                 \n             \n            \n             \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Hostages in Gaza endure another winter as their families plead for a ceasefire \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                    \n                    \n                       \n                 \n             \n            \n             \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n     \n \n\n After four failures, the Security Council on Nov. 15 adopted its first resolution after the outbreak of the  Israel-Hamas war , calling for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses” in Gaza to address the escalating crisis for Palestinian civilians during Israel’s aerial and ground attacks. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n That vote in the 15-member council was 12-0 with the United States, United Kingdom and Russia abstaining. The U.S. and U.K. said they abstained because the resolution did not condemn Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 240 abducted, and Russia because of its failure to demand a humanitarian cease-fire, which Israel and the United States oppose. \n     \n\n As the death toll in Gaza has mounted during Israel’s campaign to obliterate Hamas, calls for a cease-fire have escalated, and on Friday the U.S. was isolated in its support for Israel in the Security Council, where the vote was 13-1 with the United Kingdom abstaining. The Security Council meeting and vote last Friday were a response to a letter from U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who   invoked Article 99  of the U.N. Charter, which enables a U.N. chief to raise threats he sees to international peace and security. He warned of a  “humanitarian catastrophe”  in Gaza and urged the council to demand a humanitarian cease-fire. Guterres said he raised  Article 99   — which hadn’t been used at the U.N. since 1971 — because “there is a high risk of the total collapse of the humanitarian support system in Gaza.” The U.N. anticipates this would result in “a complete breakdown of public order and increased pressure for mass displacement into Egypt,” he warned. Gaza is at “a breaking point” and desperate people are at serious risk of starvation, Guterres said, stressing that Hamas’ brutality against Israelis on Oct. 7 “can never justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.” \n     \n\n Like the Security Council resolution, the draft General Assembly resolution makes no mention of Hamas or the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel. It expresses “grave concern over the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and the suffering of the Palestinian civilian population” and says Palestinian and Israeli people must be protected in accordance with international humanitarian law. In addition to an immediate humanitarian cease-fire, the draft demands that all parties comply with international humanitarian law, “notably with regard to the protection of civilians,” and calls for “the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, as well as ensuring humanitarian access.”",

        "title": "China Reacts to Widening Iran-Israel 'Turmoil'",
        "text": "China has responded to the widening hostilities in the Middle East after Iran fired missiles into Israel on Monday, raising fears of all-out war. The barrage  comprised some 180 missiles, a \"large number\" of which were shot down, according to Israeli officials. Tehran said the missiles were retaliation for the deaths of Iranian military personnel and their allies, including Hezbollah chief  Hassan Nasrallah  and Abbas Nilforoushan, a brigadier general in Iran's Revolutionary Guard, who died in Israeli airstrikes in Beirut last week. Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  said Iran had \"made a big mistake\" and pledged to make the country \"pay for it.\" \"China is deeply concerned about the turbulent situation in the Middle East and opposes violations of Lebanon's sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity, as well as the intensification of contradictions and the expansion of conflicts,\" China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement released Wednesday evening, without naming Iran. \"China calls on the international community, especially influential major countries, to play a constructive role and avoid further instability, the ministry spokesperson went on. They called for a \"comprehensive and lasting ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible,\" adding that the failure to achieve this is the main driver of \"the current round of turmoil in the Middle East.\" \n \n Palestinians in the West Bank inspect a fallen projectile after Iran launched a barrage of missiles at Israel on October 1.

China called for a ceasefire, saying the conflict in Gaza is the root of widening conflict in the region. \n More \n Zain Jaafar/AFP via Getty Images \n      In recent years, Beijing has sought to position itself as a more levelheaded power than Washington. China played a key role in Iran and Saudi Arabia's return to diplomatic ties last year and hosted talks among Palestinian factions, including Hamas and Fatah. Monday marked Iran's second direct aerial assault on Israel of the year. In April, the country joined proxies in Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere in the region in launching hundreds of missiles toward the country, most of which were reportedly intercepted by Israeli defenses in coordination with the United States and other partners. That attack was in response to deadly suspected Israeli airstrikes on an Iranian consulate building in Damascus, Syria. Newsweek  reached out to Israel's Foreign Ministry via email for comment. Monday will mark the first anniversary of the Israel- Hamas  conflict, sparked by the Palestinian militant group's attack on Israel that left approximately 1,200 dead. The death toll from Israel's relentless bombardment of Gaza has surpassed 41,000, according to Gaza's health authorities. Oxfam, a confederation of nongovernmental organizations, reported Monday that more women and children had died in the airstrikes than during any other conflict in the past two decades. CNN cited Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib as saying that just days before Nasrallah's death, the late Hezbollah leader had reached an agreement with Netanyahu on a three-week ceasefire. The revelation came as Israeli forces prepared to further escalate the conflict with a \"limited ground operation\" across the Lebanese border, despite calls for a ceasefire from U.S. President  Joe Biden  and other international leaders. \"I am more aware than you might know, and I'm comfortable with them stopping,\" Biden told reporters last week when asked about the planned incursion. -",

        "title": "Brazil’s intelligence agency under Bolsonaro spied on judiciary and lawmakers, police say",
        "description": "An investigation into Brazil’s federal police alleges that the country’s intelligence agency spied on members of the judiciary, lawmakers and journalists under former President Jair Bolsonaro",
        "text": "An investigation by federal police has led to allegations that Brazil’s intelligence agency spied on members of the judiciary, lawmakers and journalists during former President Jair  Bolsonaro 's administration, court records showed Thursday. Among those targeted were Chamber Speaker Arthur Lira, Supreme Justice Alexandre de Moraes, the former governor of  Sao Paulo  João Dória and members of the environmental agency Ibama, according to a Supreme Court document signed by Moraes himself. Police  on Thursday carried out five preventive arrest warrants to dismantle a “criminal organization” that allegedly illegally monitored public authorities and produced fake news using systems from Brazil’s intelligence agency, known by its Portuguese acronym ABIN. “The criminal organization also illegally accessed computers, telephone devices and telecommunications infrastructure to monitor people and public officials,” police said. Arrest warrants were issued for former member of the Secretariat of Social Communication Mateus de Carvalho Sposito, businessman Richards Dyer Pozzer, influencer Rogério Beraldo de Almeida, federal police officer Marcelo Araújo Bormevet and military officer Giancarlo Gomes Rodrigues. While Bolsonaro’s name appears five times in the Supreme Court’s decision authorizing the arrest warrants carried out Thursday, he is not formally accused of ordering any espionage. An attorney for Bolsonaro did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.  But the police’s investigation found “that ABIN had been instrumentalized, with a clear institutional deviation from clandestine actions, to monitor people related to investigations involving family members” of Bolsonaro, the court document said. Asked whether Bolsonaro faces legal risk in the case, law professor Rodrigo Sánchez Rios from the Pontifical Catholic University in Parana said yes. “It is widely accepted that Bolsonaro had knowledge about the illegal espionage scheme at the intelligence agency. The authorities who were monitored had a political future that was politically important to Bolsonaro,” Sánchez Rios said. “If that connection is proven, he could be held responsible for several crimes, no matter if related to his neglect or his action,” Sánchez Rios added Police also said their investigations showed that the group allegedly sought to interfere in several police probes, including some that targeted or involved two of Bolsonaro’s sons, Jair Renan and Flávio, a sitting senator. Those targeted by the arrest warrants are suspected of committing the crimes of criminal organization, attempted abolition of the democratic rule of law, clandestine interception of communications and invasion of another person’s computer device, police said. Police say the group used a software program called FirstMile, developed by the Israeli company Cognyte. In its opinion on the case, the Attorney General’s Office said the evidence points to the existence of a wider criminal organization. “The structure infiltrated in the  Brazilian  Intelligence Agency represented only one cell of a broader criminal organization, focused on attacking opponents, institutions and Republican systems,” the Attorney General’s Office said.  This is the latest judicial case among many linking Bolsonaro, who led the country between 2019 and 2022, to wrongdoings. The far-right leader was indicted last week under suspicion of embezzlement, asset laundering and criminal association in connection with luxury jewelry from Saudi Arabia, deepening his legal woes. In June last year, Brazil's top electoral court declared Bolsonaro ineligible to run in any elections until 2030 for casting unfounded doubts on the country’s electronic voting system. ___ Associated Press writer Mauricio Savarese contributed from Sao Paulo.",

        "title": "Oil slips after Iran plays down reported Israeli attack",
        "description": "Prices down 4% on week so far as tensions eased and Tehran indicated no plans for retaliation",
        "text": "Oil slipped on Friday following an earlier price spike of more than $3 after Iran played down reported Israeli attacks on its soil, in a sign that an escalation of hostilities in the Middle East might be avoided. Brent futures were down 72 cents, or 0.83%, at $86.39 a barrel by 1314 GMT. The front month U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude contract for for May fell 66 cents, or 0.8%, at $82.07 at 1314 GMT. The more active June contract was down 68 cents, or 0.83%, to $81.42. Explosions were heard in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Friday in what sources described as an Israeli attack, but Tehran played down the incident and said it did not plan to retaliate. “Whilst the initial spike in oil may have highlighted the initial fear of further escalation, we have seen both equities and crude reverse some of those preliminary moves,” said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets. Investors had been closely monitoring Israel’s reaction to Iranian drone attacks on April 13 that were in turn a response to a presumed Israeli air strike on April 1 that destroyed a building in Iran’s embassy compound in Damascus. Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers have added sanctions on Iran’s oil exports to a pending  Ukraine  aid package that targets ships, ports or refineries that process Iranian crude and transactions from Chinese financial institutions involving purchases of petroleum from Iran. Iran is the third largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), according to Reuters data. As oil’s risk premium has gradually unwound, prices have fallen around 4% since Monday and are set for their biggest weekly loss since early February. \nInvestors, however, are not ruling out Middle Eastern tensions will disrupt supply. “The oil market is nonetheless concerned as there is too much oil supply at stake,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, commodities analyst at SEB Research. Analysts from Goldman Sachs and Commerzbank raised their Brent crude forecasts on Friday, taking into account geopolitical tensions as well as the prospect of rising demand and restrained supply by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+). “Oil demand is growing at a healthy pace, and supply should be constrained due to the extensions of the voluntary production cuts of OPEC+,” UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.   Stay informed with access to our award-winning journalism.

        "description": "The Iran-backed militants, who say their actions are aimed at supporting Hamas, vowed retaliation and said the attacks had killed at least 5 fighters at multiple rebel-held sites.",
        "text": "The United States and Britain launched military strikes against the  Houthi rebels in Yemen  on Thursday, after weeks of mounting attacks by the Iran-backed militant group in the Red Sea. The strikes, carried out from land and sea, threatened an expansion of the conflict in the Middle East beyond Israel's war in Gaza — an escalation the Biden administration and its allies have been working to avoid.  The Houthis, who say their actions are aimed at supporting Hamas, vowed retaliation for attacks they said had killed at least five fighters at multiple sites held by the rebels. The U.S. and U.K. strikes targeted multiple locations with fighter jets and Tomahawks fired from Navy ships, officials said. The Air Force said that the strikes involved over 60 targets at 16 locations, and that over 100 “precision-guided munitions of various types,” were used. The strikes were against “command and control nodes, munitions depots, launching systems, production facilities, and air defense radar systems,” U.S. Air Forces Central  said in a statement . A British Typhoon aircraft taking off from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, for a mission to strike targets in Yemen Thursday night. Sgt Lee Goddard / UK Ministry of Defense via AP President Joe Biden said the strikes, which were supported by Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands, targeted areas used by Houthi rebels to \"endanger freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most vital waterways.\" \"Today’s defensive action follows this extensive diplomatic campaign and Houthi rebels’ escalating attacks against commercial vessels,\" Biden said in a statement Thursday evening. \"These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most critical commercial routes.\" Biden also warned that he would \"not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary.\" The extent of the damage was unclear, but the Houthis said early Friday that 73 strikes across sites it controls in Yemen had killed at least five militants and injured six others. The Iran-backed rebels vowed attacks would not go “unanswered and unpunished.” A Houthi leader confirmed that Yemen's capital, Sanaa, had been targeted.  \"A brutal aggression against our country, for which they will pay absolutely,\" Nasr Aldeen Amer, vice president of the Houthi Media Authority, said Thursday. \"Without hesitation, and we will not back down from our position in supporting the Palestinian people, whatever the cost.”  British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak urged the Houthi rebels to cease their aggression. “Despite the repeated warnings from the international community, the Houthis have continued to carry out attacks in the Red Sea,” he said in a statement Thursday confirming the strikes. “This cannot stand. The United Kingdom will always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade,” he said. Sunak said the strikes by the U.S. and U.K. were “limited, necessary and proportionate action in self-defence.” U.S. Central Command said earlier Thursday that the Iranian-backed Houthis had fired anti-ship ballistic missiles from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen into international shipping lanes in the Gulf of Aden. No injuries or damage were reported, and a commercial vessel reported seeing the missile strike the water, the statement said. The attack was the group’s 27th on international shipping since Nov. 19, Central Command said. The Houthis, from Yemen’s northwestern Saada province, rose to power as Arab Spring protests swept the region in 2011.  Three years later — with support from Tehran — the Houthis took control of the country’s capital, prompting a wider conflict with Iran’s regional rival, Saudi Arabia, and a situation in Yemen that the United Nations described as the “largest humanitarian crisis in the world.” Although the U.S., Britain and several other countries backed the Saudi-led war, Saudi  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  wound down the military operation last year and entered peace talks with the Houthis.

US Central Command / via REUTERS After Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, the Houthis pledged support for the Palestinian militants and began attacking vessels in the Red Sea — despite demands from the U.S., France and other Western allies to halt the missile and drone attacks.  A spokesman for the Houthis has said they were targeting only ships with links to Israel — a claim that has been widely disputed — to pressure Israel into halting its war in Gaza. In response, the U.S. and other countries dispatched warships to patrol the vital shipping corridor. U.S. helicopters fired on Houthis last week after they attacked a cargo ship. During a visit to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the group would face “consequences” if the attacks continued but that his “strong preference” was for the group to “get the message.” Courtney Kube Courtney Kube is a correspondent covering national security and the military for the NBC News Investigative Unit.

        "text": "Important topics and their relevance in UPSC CSE exam for  October, 11 , 2023.  If you missed the October, 10, 2023 UPSC CSE exam key from the Indian Express, read it here FRONT PAGE Netanyahu calls Modi who tells him: India with Israel in this difficult hour Syllabus: Preliminary Examination:  Current events of national and international importance. Mains Examination:  General Studies II: Effect of policies and politics of developed and developing countries on India’s interests, Indian diaspora. Key Points to Ponder: • What’s the ongoing story- In their first phone conversation since the Hamas attack on Israel, Prime Minister  Narendra Modi  told Israel’s Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  Tuesday that “people of India stand in solidarity with Israel in this difficult hour”. Thanking Netanyahu “for his phone call and providing an update on the ongoing situation”, Modi, in a post on X later, said “India strongly and unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations” — remarks reiterated in a statement by the Prime Minister’s Office. • “The Prime Minister’s remarks have been perceived as backing Israel completely in the wake of the terror attacks”-Analyse • What specific statements or positions did the Indian government or officials express regarding the ongoing developments in Israel? • “The India-Israel relationship has blossomed in the last decade or so in the framework of a robust strategic partnership, and the personal chemistry between Modi and Netanyahu has been visible in their bilateral engagements”-Examine India and Israel bilateral relations • “The political focus on India’s current solidarity with Israel masks the extraordinary transformation of Delhi’s ties with the Arab world in the last decade”-Connect the dots between India, Arab world and Israel • What is India’s Middle East policy? • What are the diplomatic challenges for New Delhi in the context of Arab-Israeli relations? • What has been the response of the Arab world to the recent confrontation between Hamas and Israel? • For Your Information- The UAE and Bahrain, which signed the US-brokered Abraham Accords with Israel, have criticised the attacks by Hamas. \nDiplomats, especially from the Arab countries, have noticed the MEA silence — the only tweets and the PMO/MEA statement so far have been about expressing solidarity with Israel, and the “terrorist attacks” on Israel. At least three diplomats from the Arab countries, including an ambassador, said they were expecting a more balanced and nuanced statement from the MEA. “The Indian diplomats just crafted a fantastic (G20) joint communique which was a superb example of a diplomatic balancing act. They have been doing that for the last year-and-a-half on the Russia- Ukraine  war. They have the skills, but we haven’t seen those skills in the last four days,” a diplomat from one of the Arab countries told  The Indian Express  Tuesday. \nIn West Asia, India has deep strategic ties with Israel on the one hand, and Saudi, UAE, Qatar, Iran and Egypt – to name a few – on the other hand. \nThere are an estimated 90 lakh Indians living and working in the West Asia region, and India imports more than 50 per cent of crude from the region. It also has high ambitions in terms of connectivity projects, articulated recently during the announcement of the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor. \nSo, it has to strike a balance between the two sides of the aisle in the deeply divided and polarised West Asia region. \nFor now, that is South Block’s defence. Sources said the Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians has divided the Arab world, and there is no united front there as well. \nThe UAE late Sunday issued a statement slamming the Hamas attack as a “serious and grave escalation”. The UAE Foreign Ministry statement said it was “appalled” by reports Israeli civilians were taken as hostages from their homes, but avoided criticism of Israel’s deadly strikes on Gaza. \n“Civilians on both sides must always have full protection under international humanitarian law and must never be a target of conflict,” the ministry said. \nBahrain also criticised the attacks by Hamas, saying it constituted “a dangerous escalation that threatens the lives of civilians”. \nThe statement from the Bahrain Foreign Ministry also affirmed “Bahrain’s denunciation of the reported kidnappings of civilians from their homes to be taken as hostages”. It urged de-escalation of the violence that threatens regional security and stability. \nSaudi Arabia has tried to strike a balance, although it did mention “Israeli occupation forces”, and was perceived to be leaning towards Palestine – there was no condemnation of the Hamas attacks. \nCountries like Qatar, Kuwait and Oman have been critical of Israel. • “Now, Delhi finds itself in an unenviable situation where it is torn between different sides: it has Israel which is a key strategic partner on one side, and a divided Arab world on the other side”-Discuss Other Important Articles Covering the same topic:   📍 New Delhi, new Tel Aviv 📍 Cracks visible as Arab envoys wait for Delhi word: UAE, Bahrain slam Hamas 📍 Why Gandhi was against a Jewish state in Palestine Climate change risks: Cloud over India chip dreams, Moody’s flags flood fears Syllabus: Preliminary Examination:  General issues on Environmental ecology, Bio-diversity and Climate Change Main Examination:  • General Studies II: Government policies and interventions for development in various sectors and issues arising out of their design and implementation. • General Studies III: Conservation, environmental pollution and degradation, environmental impact assessment. • General Studies III: Infrastructure: Energy, Ports, Roads, Airports, Railways etc. Key Points to Ponder: • What’s the ongoing story-  Even as India moves to build out a domestic semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem to reduce its reliance on imports, the country’s ambition could be headed for troubled waters – it faces an overall doubling in the risk from flooding, as a consequence of climate change, in the next three decades or so. \nAccording to Moody’s risk management solutions, by 2050, the costs of flooding are expected to rise by around 30 per cent, from water stress by 35 per cent, sea level rise by 60 per cent, and heat stress by 150 per cent by 2050 under a moderate climate change scenario. \n“With India also starting to initiate policies favouring greater self-sufficiency in semiconductors, it also faces an overall doubling in the risk from flooding by mid-century,” Moody’s said in a blog. • What exactly Moody’s risk management solutions said? • What factors may contribute to potential challenges in the domestic semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem? • “The year so far has been erratic in terms of weather patterns in India”-Examine • What makes Semiconductors the most important commodities in the global market right now? • For Your Information- Semiconductors are arguably among the most important commodities in the global market right now, with use in a myriad of sectors – from computers to cars, and airplanes to railways. Any break in supply will result in other production lines, such as cars and computers, grinding to a halt. \nAs the West tries to distance itself from China owing to evolving geopolitical tensions, India has pitched itself as a “trusted” alternative for electronics manufacturing. New Delhi has identified chip manufacturing as a key driver for future economic growth, and has sanctioned a $2.75 billion packaging plant currently being developed by Micron Technology. \n Taiwan , which is home to over 90 per cent of the most advanced – below 10 nanometers semiconductor manufacturing capacity – could see chip plants’ costs related to climate risks rise substantially over the next 20-30 years, Moody’s said. • What exactly India Inc have said recently? • “Weather is the “only single business risk”-Comment • How climate change impacts companies and their profits? • For Your Information- WEATHER influences sales, and the bottomline. And irregular climate is an uncertainty that is biting companies plans, and profits. The year so far hasn’t made it easier for India Inc. If February was the warmest in over a century, March was unusually rainy, 26 per cent more rainfall than long-period average (LPA); August has been the driest since 1901, receiving 36 per cent less rainfall than its LPA. • What is the evidence of climate change? • How vulnerable is India to climate change? • What is the macroeconomic impact of climate change on India? • For Your Information- Climate change can adversely impact both the supply side (read the productive potential) as well as the demand side. It can stroke  inflation , reduce economic output, trigger uncertainty and change consumer behaviour. \nOver the years, there have been several predictions and assessments made about the impact of climate change on India’s economy. Some are listed below: \n1. According to Niti Aayog in 2019, around 600 millions of India’s population are facing severe water stress, with 8 million children below 14 years in urban India at risk due to poor water supply. \n2. The World Bank in 2020 said that India could account for 34 million of the projected 80 million global job losses from heat stress associated productivity decline by 2030. \n3. The IPCC Working Group in 2022 stated that India is one of the most vulnerable countries globally in terms of the population that would be affected by the sea level rise. By the middle of the present century, around 35 million people in India could face annual coastal flooding, with 45-50 million at risk by the end of the century. \nTypically the risks from climate change are categorised in two main ways. One is the physical risks and these include chronic issues (such as a gradual and sustained change in temperature and precipitation) as well as acute events such as extreme weather occurrences). \nThe second category of risks are called transition risks; simply put, these refer to economy-wide changes arising from the transition towards a low-carbon economy. This is best encapsulated by a paradox called “success is failure”. This phrase was used by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in 2016. Carney meant that if the shift towards becoming a low-carbon economy is too rapid, it could materially damage a country’s financial stability. • What is the extent of loss and damage? • What is the economic cost of climate change? • How vulnerable is India’s economy to such climate change? • What will happen to our GDP and inflation if timely action is not taken to address climate concerns? • Can policies provide some solutions? • What is the supply chain for semiconductors? • What are the steps in the semiconductor supply chain? • Which nation holds the distinction of being the primary source of semiconductors on a global scale? • “A key element of the partnership is the resolve to diversify the global semiconductor supply chain, which is at the centre of the rivalry between the world’s number 1 and 2 economic powers, the US and China”-What do you understand by this? • What is semiconductor? • What is the most basic component of a semiconductor chip? • Semiconductors are the foundation of nearly every modern electronic gadget.

The 2018 scheme introduced instruments through which money could be donated to political parties in India. However, in April last year, the court had said it would take up the petitions filed by two NGOs — Common Cause and Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) — challenging the scheme. • What is the electoral bonds scheme? • Electoral Bonds-Key Features • What was the rationale behind the electoral bonds scheme? • Why is the scheme facing a legal challenge and what are its larger criticisms? • For Your Information- Announced in the 2017  Union Budget , electoral bonds are interest-free bearer instruments used to donate money anonymously to political parties. Simply put, anyone can donate money to political parties through them. \nSuch bonds, which are sold in multiples of Rs 1,000, Rs 10,000, Rs 1 lakh, Rs 10 lakh, and Rs 1 crore, can be bought from authorised branches of the  State Bank of India  (SBI). As such, a donor is required to pay the amount — say Rs 10 lakh — via a cheque or a digital mechanism (cash is not allowed) to the authorised SBI branch. \nThe political parties can choose to encash such bonds within 15 days of receiving them and fund their electoral expenses. There is no limit on the number of bonds an individual or company can purchase. If a party hasn’t enchased any bonds within 15 days, SBI deposits these into the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund. \nWhen first announced in then Finance Minister  Arun Jaitley ’s Budget speech of 2017, he had said, “Even 70 years after Independence, the country has not been able to evolve a transparent method of funding political parties which is vital to the system of free and fair elections…Political parties continue to receive most of their funds through anonymous donations which are shown in cash. An effort, therefore, requires to be made to cleanse the system of political funding in India.” \nTwo main changes were proposed then. One, it reduced the amount of money that a political party could accept in cash from anonymous sources — from Rs 20,000 to Rs 2,000. Two, he announced the introduction of electoral bonds as a way to make such funding more transparent. \nHowever, the fine print of the notification has revealed that even individuals, groups of individuals, NGOs, religious and other trusts are permitted to donate via electoral bonds without disclosing their details. • Which Bank is the only bank authorised to sell Electoral Bonds? • Electoral Bonds and associated issues • When are the bonds available for purchase? • Are electoral bonds taxable? • Why were electoral bonds introduced in India? • Why are electoral bonds being so vehemently opposed by transparency activists? • How popular are electoral bonds as a route of donation? • What does the Supreme Court have to say on electoral bonds? • What is the Election Commission’s stand on electoral bonds? • Reserve Bank of India on electoral bonds scheme?

He further sought to underline that local issues are best left to the High Courts. • In what specific legal or judicial setting did the Supreme Court issue the aforementioned statement? • “The Supreme Court’s role is not to micromanage issues that arise across the country”-Analyse • For Your Information -“…How can we run the country like this? On every little thing… Now tomorrow we will have an IA from  Maharashtra , we will have an IA from  Karnataka . How do we deal with it? We have to as a court have broader functional understanding, what is the role of the Supreme Court in the nation? Not to deal with micromanagement of issues which arise all over the country. If the HC commits an egregious error, we are here. We will correct the error. If there is a violation of the law by the HC, which is obviously not likely in a given situation…” the CJI presiding over a three-judge bench remarked while hearing a matter related to captive elephants. \nThe main petition which raises questions on captive elephants in the light of the Wildlife Protection Act has been pending before the Court since 2014. However, more than two dozen Intervention Applications (IAs) have also been filed in the petition since then. \nTuesday, one such IA filed by a native of Kerala came up before the bench also comprising Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra. \nTaking exception to what it said is the “proliferation of IAs”, the bench told senior advocate C U Singh who appeared for the applicant that he should approach the Kerala HC. \nSingh said 131 captive elephants had died in the state between February and September 2022 and that a majority of them were under 50 years old. He added that after the IA was filed in November 2022 till September 23, there were 22 more recorded deaths. “There may be some unrecorded too. It’s a startlingly high rate,” he said. \nBut the bench pointed out that he was not the petitioner but an intervenor who was seeking substantive relief. “You are an intervenor based in Kerala. Point this out to the HC there. Because these are matters pertaining to states. We have a petition pan-India. We should make sure that the SC is not rendered dysfunctional because we spread ourselves too thin. You have a plea dealing specifically with facets that pertain to the state of Kerala. You are not even a petitioner, but an intervenor. Go to the HC, let the HC deal with it,” said the CJI. \nThe CJI said, “My concern is this. We are not saying that what you (petitioners) point out does not deserve (consideration)… But there are 1,000 issues which merit attention. The SC should not render itself completely dysfunctional… Also, we deal with these issues on an ad-hoc basis. Pick up an IA here, pick up an IA there, pass order. You have HCs which consist of some seasoned judges. They know the ground reality. They know the impact of passing an order disabling the use of elephants. It’s also a matter which relates to local feelings. We don’t know the ramifications of an order like this which we will pass. Judges of the HC are peculiarly suited to understand the local conditions, they understand the context in which these elephants are housed. Let them deal with the matter at a primary level. If they make an egregious error, we are here to correct those errors.” • What is an intervention application? • What is the history of Supreme Court in India? • What are the Constitutional Provisions with respect to Supreme Court in India? • The Constitution has made certain provisions to safeguard and ensure the independent and impartial functioning of a Judges-Know in detail • Jurisdiction And Powers of Supreme Court of India-Know in detail Other Important Articles Covering the same topic:   📍 India@75, Looking at 100: A court that protects the people EXPRESS NETWORK Bogus work, forged bills in MGNREGS irregularities go beyond Bengal: Reports Syllabus: Preliminary Examination:  Economic and Social Development Main Examination:  General Studies II: Important aspects of Governance and Welfare schemes for vulnerable sections of the population by the Centre and States and the performance of these schemes Key Points to Ponder: • What’s the ongoing story- While  West Bengal  is currently in the spotlight due to alleged irregularities in the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Scheme (MGNREGS) implementation, resulting in funds being stopped by the Centre, the National Level Monitoring (NLM) reports available with the Union Ministry of Rural Development show irregularities in implementing the rural job guarantee scheme across several states. • What is the National Level Monitoring (NLM) report? • What exactly National Level Monitoring (NLM) reports pointed out? • For Your Information- According to NLM guidelines, the Rural Development Ministry can depute NLMs in three conditions— regular monitoring of major schemes, special monitoring of an individual scheme and in cases of complaints or enquiries. A special monitoring of MGNREGS was conducted in three phases during 2022-23 across the country, three separate reports of which have been compiled by Delhi-based CMI Social Research Centre. \nThe first report of the special monitoring of MG-NREGS by NLMs, finalised in January 2022, gives details of onsite verification. The report states, “The selection of Gram Panchayat (GP) for this Special Monitoring was done at the Ministry level however the works to be verified were to be identified by NLM Teams on a random basis. Largely, in almost all the districts, the assets created under the works verified were found existing on ground.” \nHowever, the report highlights that of 55 MGNREGA works selected at random from the NLMs in  Rajasthan ’s Jhalawar district, 23 were found to be “not existing”. “NLM report for district Jhalawar (Rajasthan) has some very startling observations in this regard. The NLM Teams in 12 GPs have verified 55 MGNREGA works, selected randomly and out of them 23 works were found ‘not existing’. \nNLM has observed that most of these works were Water Conservation and Water Harvesting activities like earthen check dams/bunding/pond/desilting of pond etc. whereas some works of other categories were also found not existing,” the report said. \n“The NLM findings also suggest that the expenditure incurred on these works was bogus, fake bills have been produced and wages paid to the workers has been siphoned by the functionaries at different levels,” the report said. The report shows two MG-NREGS works were found “missing” on ground in Jalpaiguri,West Bengal. \nThe second report, finalised in May 2022, noted that out of 6,538 worksites inspected, no work had been initiated at 23 of these. “All of these works have been reported as ongoing or completed as per the MIS,” the report said. Of these 23 works, 6 were in Karnataka, 5 were in Bihar, 4 each in Punjab and Rajasthan, two in West Bengal, and one each in Himachal Pradesh and Jharkhand. Citing an example from these 23 missing works, the report noted, Gravel Road Construction found missing…On inspection of the above work site by NLM, it was found that MR [Muster Roll] has been generated on this work and a total of 1993 persondays of employment is booked against which a payment of Rs. 4.31 Lakh has made. It was found that no work/activity has been undertaken on this site. The Village Development Officer and Sarpanch of the GP failed to provide any clarification and admitted that no work has been actually undertaken,” the report said. • Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)-Mandate, Goals • What are the core objectives of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS)? • When was Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act passed by the Indian Parliament? • What is the relationship between the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA) and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS)? • In what way paradigm shift has taken place with the implementation of MGNREGA? • Who are the key stakeholders of MGNREGS? • What is the role of Gram Sabha and Gram Panchayat in MGNREGS? • How is Household defined in MGNREGA? • Issues with MGNREGA? • What are the eligibility criteria for receiving the benefits under MGNREGA scheme? • Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)-Nodal Ministry • Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and Social Audit • How schemes such as MGNREGA can help alleviate distress migration?

Key Points to Ponder: • What’s the ongoing story-  A day after it allowed a woman to terminate her 25-week-old pregnancy, the Supreme Court on Tuesday asked All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) authorities to put it on hold for now. A bench presided by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrchud noted that “AIIMS doctors are in a very serious dilemma” as they were of the view that the fetus is “currently viable” meaning that it will show signs of life and has a strong possibility of survival. • A bench presided by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrchud noted that “AIIMS doctors are in a very serious dilemma”-Understand and decode • The constitutional right of women to make reproductive choices in India-Know Supreme court of India’s verdict • What is India’s law on abortion? • Why does the legislation have this gap? • The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 and The new Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act 2021-Compare and Contrast • Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act 2021-Know the key provisions • For Your Information- Rule 3B of Rules annexed to the MTP Act, which was amended in 2021, specify seven categories of women who are eligible for termination between 20-24 weeks. These are: survivors of sexual assault or rape or incest; minors; those who have a change of marital status during the ongoing pregnancy (widowhood and divorce); women with physical disabilities; mentally ill women; women carrying malformed foetus that has substantial risk of being incompatible with life; and women with pregnancy in humanitarian settings or disaster or emergency situations as may be declared by the government. • Significance and importance of Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act 2021? • Issues and Challenges associated with Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act 2021?

Main Examination:  General Studies III: Conservation, environmental pollution and degradation, environmental impact assessment. Key Points to Ponder: • What’s the ongoing story- In keeping with this year’s trend — when almost every month so far has broken one or the other temperature record — September has turned out to be the hottest September ever, by a big margin. And though there are three more months to go in the year, it is looking increasingly probable that 2023 will emerge as the warmest year ever, overtaking the record set in 2016. The extraordinary streak of record-breaking temperature events this year have not come as a surprise. Scientists had been expecting this year to be very warm, mainly because of the development of El Nino in the Pacific Ocean, even though individual events could not be predicted. The remaining three months of the year are also forecast to be warmer than usual. • Why September has turned out to be the hottest September ever? • For Your Information- The record-breaking temperatures in September come on the back of several similar records for other months this year. In fact, July this year was not just the warmest July, it was the warmest for any month. That means that the average global monthly temperature has never been as high as in July this year. Several days in that month broke the daily temperature records. \nBefore that, June was the warmest June ever, while February, March, April and May all recorded average temperatures that were in the top-five highest ever brackets for those respective months. \nIn addition, the three-month period between June and August was the warmest ever on record, during which temperatures everywhere across the world — not just the global average — reached levels that were made at least two times more likely by climate change. \nEven in this grim scenario, September managed to carve out another dubious distinction. The average global temperature for September was 1.75 degree Celsius warmer than the average of the 1850-1900 period, the pre-industrial time that is usually considered the baseline for measuring temperature changes. No other month, not even July this year, showed such a large deviation from the pre-industrial average. • How El Nino impacts earth temperature?

Mains Examination:  General Studies II: Effect of policies and politics of developed and developing countries on India’s interests. Key Points to Ponder: • What’s the ongoing story-  Why did the Palestinian militant group Hamas attack Israel? And why now? Experts say one reason could be to disrupt or destroy ongoing negotiations, mediated by the United States, for the normalisation of ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia. The two countries are on the cusp of signing an agreement that could potentially mark a tectonic shift in the political landscape of the Middle East. But this deal, if it comes through, will also show that the support for an independent Palestinian state is no longer a priority for the Arab world, of which Saudi Arabia is the leader. That is something that Hamas does not want. And notably, the militants attacked southern Israel just days after the US announced that the “basic framework” of the agreement was in place. Nine hundred Israelis are now dead in the attack, and 150 have been taken hostage in Gaza. A fierce Israeli retaliation has killed almost 700 Palestinians so far. • What is the potential deal between Israel and Saudi? • But how will the formalisation of ties with the Saudis help Israel? • And what’s in the deal for the United States? • What would the Palestinians get in the deal? • Why is the US pushing the deal now? • So will the Israel-Hamas conflict affect the deal?

        "title": "White House warns Israel over post-war plans for Gaza",
        "text": "The White House maintained Tuesday that it doesn’t believe Israeli forces should reoccupy Gaza  following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu comments  that the country will have the “overall security responsibility” in Gaza for an “indefinite period” after the war ends.\n     \n            “The president still believes that a reoccupation of Gaza by Israeli forces is not good. It’s not good for Israel; not good for the Israeli people,” said National Security Council spokesman John Kirby on “CNN This Morning.”\n     \n            “One of the conversations that Secretary (Antony) Blinken has been having in the region is what does post-conflict Gaza look like? What does governance look like in Gaza? Because whatever it is it can’t be what it was on October 6. It can’t be Hamas,” he added.\n     \n            The latest warning from the White House comes after Netanyahu told ABC News on Monday that Gaza should be governed by “those who don’t want to continue the way of Hamas” before adding, “I think Israel will, for an indefinite period, will have the overall security responsibility because we’ve seen what happens when we don’t have it.”\n     \n            It was one of the first hints Netanyahu has given about his vision for a post-war Gaza and suggests a divergent view than that of the US, including President Joe Biden’s own statements about what the future of the strip would look like.\n     \n            In  an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes” last month,  Biden said it would be a “big mistake” for Israel to occupy Gaza. At the time, Michael Herzog, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, told CNN’s Jake Tapper that Israel does not intend to occupy Gaza after the conflict ends.\n     \n            There have been other sharp gaps between the US and Israel emerging in recent weeks as the war continues.  Blinken last week pushed the Israelis  for a “humanitarian pause” to allow hostages and civilians to leave Gaza and for aid for Palestinians to enter, but was rebuked by Netanyahu.\n     \n            And despite Blinken’s forceful public missive that “civilians should not suffer the consequences for (Hamas’) inhumanity and its brutality,” Israeli forces continued to strike civilian sites in the wake of the top US diplomat’s visit. The forces claimed that the sites were being used by Hamas.\n     \n            Biden told reporters in Washington that he hasn’t had a chance to speak with Netanyahu on Tuesday – but he did ask the Israeli prime minister to consider a humanitarian pause when the two leaders spoke on Monday.\n     \n            “I didn’t get a chance to talk to him today. I did ask him for a pause in the past –- yesterday. I’m still waiting to hear from other people,” Biden told reporters.\n     \n            Israeli government officials have not yet elaborated on how Gaza would be governed should they succeed in eliminating Hamas.\n     \n            Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Tuesday that Israel will “retain complete freedom of action to respond to any situation in the Gaza Strip” once the war ends. Gallant said that “at the end of this ‘campaign,’ Hamas, as a military organization or governing body in Gaza, will cease to exist.” Gallant’s comments were published on the Ynet news website.\n     \n            “There will be no security threat to Israel from Gaza, and Israel will retain complete freedom of action, to respond to any situation in the Gaza Strip that poses any kind of threat,” Gallant can be heard saying on the Ynet recording of a meeting of Israel’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.\n     \n            Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Netanyahu, told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday that Israel is “not talking about any sort of ongoing occupation of the Gaza strip.”\n     \n            “When this is over and we have defeated Hamas, it is crucial that there won’t be a resurgent terrorist element, a resurgent Hamas. There is no point doing this and just going back to square one,” Regev told CNN.\n     \n            “There will have to be an Israeli security presence, but that doesn’t mean Israel is re-occupying Gaza, that doesn’t mean that Israel is there to govern the Gazans,” he continued.\n     \n            The US and its western allies  have been telling their Israeli counterparts  for weeks that Israel should have clear objectives when it comes to degrading Hamas and should seek to avoid a long-term occupation of the Gaza Strip.\n     \n            US officials had previously told CNN that they didn’t have a clear sense for Israel’s intentions in Gaza and believe it will be difficult for Hamas to be eradicated entirely.\n     \n            Despite the apparent gaps between his administration and the Israeli government, Biden reiterated support for Israel during a call with Netanyahu on Monday, Kirby said.\n     \n            “One of the things that the president made clear to the prime minister is that we’re going to continue to stand with Israel. We’re going to continue to make sure that they have the security assistance they need, the tools, the weapons, the capabilities to go after Hamas. That hasn’t changed since October 7 and it’s not going to change going forward,” Kirby said.\n     \n             CNN’s Jennifer Hansler, Hagi Cohen-Boland, Stephanie Halasz, Natasha Bertrand, Katie Bo Lillis, Oren Liebermann, Kareem El Damanhoury and Mitchell McCluskey contributed to this report.",

        "description": "The protesters called for an end to the killing of women and children in Gaza and criticised US support for Israel.",
        "text": "A protest has been held outside Ireland’s houses of parliament to call for an immediate end to the killing of people in  Gaza . The demonstration was organised in response to a US delegation visiting the Irish parliamentary building, Leinster House, on Friday. Protesters  criticised the US for continuing to arm  Israel  and called for the killing of civilians in Gaza to stop. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the 11 months since the October attack on southern Israel, in which militants killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Much of Gaza has been devastated by Israel’s subsequent military operation, which has destroyed water and sanitation services and limited food supplies to the Palestinian enclave. UNRWA, the UN relief agency for Palestinians, said this week there was now a risk of a polio outbreak due to the collapse of the region’s health services and a confirmed case in a 10-month-old child. At the protest outside the gates to Leinster House on Dublin’s Merrion Street, people held signs with the slogans “Stop the genocide” and “Genocide Joe”, referring to US President  Joe Biden  and the US continuing to support Israel. People carried signs reading “I’m a mother, not a target” and “I’m a child, not a target” and two protesters wore masks featuring the faces of Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  and Mr Biden. At the Kildare Street end, a larger demonstration was held to the beat of drums, with people chanting “Free, free Palestine” and “Occupation no more” while waving Palestinian flags. People Before Profit TD Brid Smith said she was informed in July that a US delegation would visit the Dail chamber, to which she responded to say that her party did not approve in the context of US support for Israel. “We’re in the middle of the worst genocide that the world has seen in many decades and if the US weren’t funding Israel it would come to an end,” she said of the destruction in Gaza. She said when she heard nothing back, she told the Irish Palestinian Solidarity Campaign and Mothers Against Genocide who organised the protest on Friday. She said she understands that the protest will continue until the delegation leaves Leinster House. “It’s not a mass protest like I’ve seen in Ireland on the question of Palestine, it’s not of that size, but it is a very young and very loud and very vibrant protest,” she said. “People are disgusted and raging that the Dail chamber was used in this way,” she said, adding that although it has happened before, it was now in the context of Israel depending on the US. She added: “On the boycott (of Israeli goods), I was involved in the anti-apartheid movement in the 80s, and it didn’t happen overnight that the apartheid state was brought down in South Africa. “It took many years of the South African people fighting back but also global solidarity. “I think people feel very dispirited and hopeless about what’s going on in Gaza but actually the boycott movement is very, very important.”",

Israel's brigade and battalion commanders were shown where ground troops are expected to enter and advance during the looming ground offensive.

Israeli Defence Forces Spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner said that Israel continues to act in order to destroy and demolish the capabilities of Hamas.   “We are in day 10 of our war on Hamas after the government instructed us to destroy Hamas's capabilities, its infrastructure, pursue its leaders, and restore security and safety to the people of Israel. Indeed, throughout the last ten days, the IDF has conducted hundreds of strikes against Hamas operatives, the leadership, its institutions and its terrorist infrastructure,” he said.",

        "title": "Germany faces domestic lawsuit over its arms sales to Israel",
        "text": "German human rights groups bring court action amid rising dismay in country at deaths in Gaza Germany will face a fresh call to revoke all arms sales to Israel on Thursday in a lawsuit that puts more pressure on Berlin amid a rising outcry about the scale of deaths and destruction in the war on Gaza. A lawsuit in the German domestic courts will ask judges to urgently direct the government to revoke all arms licences to  Israel  issued since 7 October, when Hamas launched its attack on Israel. Germany is widely seen as the second largest arms exporter to Israel behind the US, and is certainly a more significant provider of arms than the UK. The lawsuit has been issued by four human rights groups on behalf of five named Palestinians who say they are in fear of their lives in  Gaza , and are suffering a form of collective punishment by Israel. The legal action is directed against the Green party-led federal ministry for economic affairs and climate action, the department responsible for export licences under the weapons of war control act. “It is reasonable to believe that the German government is in violation of the arms trade treaty, the Geneva conventions and its obligations under the  genocide convention  – agreements that have been ratified by Germany,” said a statement from one of the lead litigants, the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR). The lawsuit, likely to be handled through written proceedings, would have the most practical impact on the German sale of 3,000 anti-tank weapons. The five Palestinians include those who have lost relatives in the war, as well as their homes and jobs and are considered internally displaced persons, states the lawsuit. “All five of my children were killed when Israel fired on the refugee camp where we were staying after fleeing from the north,” one of the plaintiffs said. “Germany must stop sending weapons that fuel this war. No other mother should suffer such a terrible loss.” The ECCHR general secretary, Wolfgang Kaleck, said that international law and human rights were “fundamental” . “A basic prerequisite for a rules-based and human rights-oriented German foreign policy is respect for the law in its own decision making. Germany cannot remain true to its values if it exports weapons to a war where serious violations of international humanitarian law are apparent.” The Green foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has become increasingly critical of Israel, describing Gaza as a hell, but for historical reasons Germany says preservation of Israel’s security is at the heart of its foreign policy. The case is separate from  that brought by Nicaragua , which this week pleaded in front of the international court of justice in The Hague that Germany was in defiance of the Geneva conventions by continuing to supply arms to Israel. The German government told the court that it had received Israeli assurances that it had taken precautions and it currently had no reason to doubt this. While Germany exported defence equipment worth €203m (£174m) to Israel in October 2023, the volume in March amounted to only €1m, the government lawyers said. At the same time, the Global Legal Action Network has now been given a date of 23 April for an oral hearing for its request for judicial review of the UK statement that arms exports can continue on the basis of legal advice that Israel is not acting unlawfully. It is expected UK ministers will set out further next week in parliament how the legal advice shows Israel is not in breach of international humanitarian law, a judgment that has been the subject of intenseargument. The government has  refused to publish the legal advice  or a summary of it, but ministers are expected to explain the policy position.",

Rebuilding our military, confronting Communist China and seeking accountability for the disastrous learning loss brought about by the terrible closure of schools during COVID-19 should matter to most voters but will not. (The soaring antisemitism in our country and especially on campus is part of the broader \"Israel\" issue.)          \n        \n       Former President Donald Trump has a record as president on all three of the big issues.  Vice President Kamala Harris  has a record only on the border and illegal immigration but Friday she helpfully identified herself as unprepared to handle inflation while she has already outed herself as anything but a friend to Israel.   Inflation   A dozen eggs cost $1.51 in 2020, the last year of the first term of Donald Trump. A barrel of oil averaged below $40.       LEADER OF RADICAL GROUP THAT AMPLIFIED PRO-HAMAS ESSAY MADE MULTIPLE VISITS TO BIDEN-HARRIS WHITE HOUSE     \n        \n       With a very few exceptions, the price of eggs runs $4 to $7 and oil is double what it was four years ago. The two prices are, of course, connected. Everything to do with the price of eggs, from the care and feeding of chickens through to the packaging of the eggs and their shipment to stores and the operations of outlets from roadside stands to small markets to Costco costs much more because of the inflation in oil prices and all energy.       Vice President Kamala Harris has challenges with three major issues – inflation, immigration and Israel.   (Peter Zay/Anadolu via Getty Images)     The Biden-Harris dive into \"the Green New Deal\" not only flooded the country with money while production and supply lines struggled to repair the damage done to the supply chain to the world by the COVID-19 virus, it also did so as it signaled a war on fossil fuels. Oil markets, which always look forward, priced in the anti-oil policies of the Green Democrats, and the oil markets have never recovered.   Thus, the classic \"too much money chasing too few goods\" took over and caused inflation that was exacerbated by the spike in fossil fuel costs driven by a market wary of Biden-Harris hostility to domestic production.       \n        \n       Kamala Harris told us candidly in 2019, when she ran a spectacularly unsuccessful campaign for president, that she would absolutely ban all fracking just as she told us she would \"absolutely, on day one\"  close all detention centers  for illegal immigrants.   A print statement from her campaign assures us that’s all in the past now, but without one interview in the month since Biden withdrew from the race, why would anyone believe her campaign staff on these enormous flip-flops and not her record compiled during two decades as a San Francisco left-wing Democrat?    Video     The past month has in fact seen a steady flow of printed statements by the Harris campaign purporting to repudiate her 2019 campaign and her voting record in the Senate. But how did she open her 2024 campaign? With a call for price controls, a notoriously bad idea and one that has been tried and failed before in post-war America, under President Richard Nixon from 1971 to 1974. Harris reverted to her core orientation: not merely a big government liberal, but an enormous-sized government radical.           \n        \n       The Harris campaign isn’t serious. The consequences of a Harris presidency would be.   It took Harris 25 days to come up with her campaign’s first big policy proposals, the major one of which turned out to be proven failures from 50 years ago while the second was simply gas for the inflation fires.   When Nixon tried wage-and-price controls in 1971 and again in 1973, they were a disaster, the low point of domestic policy of his presidency. There’s a reason why the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda California does not have an exhibit of wage-and-price controls. Though Nixon tasked very smart people with trying to make them work — Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, George Schultz, John Connally, Arthur Burns and more — they failed miserably.       Richard Nixon also tried price controls and failed. FILE: Nixon gives the thumbs up after his resignation as 37th president.   (Gene Forte/Consolidated News Pictures/Getty Images)         \n        \n       Because price controls cannot work and never have, not even in police states. They produce only shortages, black markets and thousands of bureaucrats charged with enforcing the price controls.   PBS did a look back at that doomed policy from the early 1970s. \"Government officials were now in the business of setting prices and wages,\" the report noted about the second plunge into government price-setting in 1973 after the first round of controls in 1971. \"This time, however, it was apparent that the control system was not working.\"  The PBS assessment continued: \"Ranchers stopped shipping their cattle to the market, farmers drowned their chickens, and consumers emptied the shelves of supermarkets. Nixon took some comfort from a side benefit that George Shultz, at the time head of the Office of Management and Budget, identified. ‘At least,’ Shultz told the president, 'we have now convinced everyone else of the rightness of our original position that wage-price controls are not the answer.' Most of the system was finally abolished in April 1974.\"      \n        \n       Wage-and-price controls failed in the 1970s because bureaucrats cannot outthink free markets. It’s not a credible position to advocate for price controls under any guise anymore. But Harris pitched price controls as her very first explicit volley of policy.     Video         The second was a proposal to gift $25,000 to anyone who wanted to buy a first home. This is an astonishing proposal — and astonishingly stupid — as the last thing the American economy needs is a repeat of subsidized entry into the housing market of the sort that the sub-prime mortgages of the pre-2008 world featured.   Of course, California has had a \"housing crisis\" for three decades and nowhere more severe than San Francisco where Harris made her political career, so it is not surprising that Harris would march out into public for the first time with a doomed-to-fail proposal to spend vast sums on targeted voters, one doomed to fail at great cost.       \n        \n       The federal government cannot successfully build \"housing units.\" Only the private sector can follow market trends, efficiently and successfully bring large numbers of new homes and apartments to planning departments, and only local governments can approve housing starts. (The tiny exceptions to this rule — public housing projects, shelters for homeless or subsidized group homes for the disabled — have minimal impact on the national housing market.) If even one serious home builder was involved in the development of Harris’ second major policy proposal, they should identify themselves. Don’t hold your breath.   Harris’ first two policy proposals will exacerbate inflation, and she does not appear to know it. The Financial Times succinctly summarized the shocked reactions of economists in the free world: \"Democrats on defensive after Kamala Harris’ economic plans poorly received\" ran the headline. \"Cool response to price-gouging pledge complicates vice-president’s bid to win trust on inflation,\" was the subhead.       Migrants walk along the highway through Suchiate, Chiapas state in southern Mexico, Sunday, July 21, 2024, during their journey north toward the U.S. border.   (AP Photo/Edgar H. Clemente)     Harris, already on tape after tape defending Bidenomics, had one shot at distancing herself from the ruinous economic policy of the Biden-Harris years. She face-planted.   The border and illegal immigration      \n        \n       On immigration, Harris has a record from which she cannot run but on which she does not want to run. Too bad. It’s her record.   In March 2021, the AP reported that \"President Joe Biden has tapped Vice President Kamala Harris to lead the White House effort to tackle the migration challenge at the U.S. southern border and work with Central American nations to address root causes of the problem.\"      \"When she speaks, she speaks for me,\" Biden said at the time, citing Harris’ past work as California’s attorney general as making \"her specially equipped to lead the administration’s response,\" according to AP.    Video         \n        \n       \"Harris is tasked with overseeing diplomatic efforts to deal with issues spurring migration in the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, as well as pressing them to strengthen enforcement on their own borders, administration officials said,\" the AP’s report continued. \"She’s also tasked with developing and implementing a long-term strategy that gets at the root causes of migration from those countries.\"  \"A senior administration official said Harris' role would focus on ‘two tracks’\" NBC News added at the time. \" [B]oth curbing the current flow of migrants  and implementing a long-term strategy that addresses the root causes of migration. Cabinet members, including the secretary of state, are expected to work closely with Harris on these issues.\" (Emphasis added.)   Harris failed in spectacular fashion as \"border czar\" and has sought to make the fact that Biden did not use the formal title \"border czar\" the primary issue in campaign coverage of the border in an attempt to divert attention from her primary responsibility for the consequences of her hapless tenure as point person on border enforcement. As president, she would be far worse than Biden on the border, for progressive activists have long been vocal on the need to abandon border enforcement as a priority.   Israel       \n        \n       The national security issues for the fall should focus on the Chinese Communist Party and its global ambitions and on rebuilding our military after four years of neglect.  On Israel, Harris’ decision to boycott  Prime Minister Netanyahu’s address to Congress and then to use the language of \"the resistance\" among pro-Hamas activists after her private meeting with the leader of the Jewish State confirms what is in fact already certain: Harris will be America’s first explicitly anti-Israel president.       Anti-Israel protesters participate in the ‘Bodies Outside of Unjust Laws’ march ahead of the start of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois on Sunday, August 18, 2024.   (Fox News Digital )     Former President Barack Obama designed a catastrophic appeasement of the Iranian regime which still torments the Middle East and that failed completely. Biden sometimes exercises his muscle memory of when the Democratic Party could be counted on to support Israel quickly and comprehensively, but just as often — and more recently — forgets that traditional support for Israel and indulges the Obamian impulse to blame Israel for defending itself against the rogue regime in Tehran.   No American who supports Israel can deceive themselves on this point: Harris and her team are even more radical than Biden’s and Obama’s, and she and they would isolate Israel and make it more vulnerable to Iran and its many proxies.   The big three          \n        \n       On the \"big three issues,\" facts are stubborn things. I’ve called this the \"Eggs Election\" on air because it’s the easiest price point aside from the price at the pump that large numbers of voters can relate to. Revisit the top of this column: A dozen eggs averaged $1.50 in 2020. Today it is very rare to find any locale where the same dozen will cost less than $4 a carton, and often much more. Young families especially run through eggs as a staple.   The Green New Deal pumped trillions into an overheated economy and the cost of everything, but especially food soared. That’s because it requires energy to produce and transport food. That’s it. \"Supply chain disruptions\" have long ceased to persuade any consumer on the topic of prices. A barrel of oil averaged less than $40 in 2020 because Trump had unleashed domestic production, stood solidly behind fracking, wanted the Key Stone Pipeline. Oil is often more than double that today and rarely barely less than $75 a barrel.    Video     There’s the explanation for food prices: Massive spending to juice demand with a heavy hand halting robust energy production. That was the perfect storm for prices, and the Federal Reserve fought back with the only tool it had: hiking interest rates, which crushed the hopes of would-be new home buyers.       \n        \n       Harris will double or triple down on her anti-oil, anti-coal, anti-fracking and anti-natural gas radicalism. It is in her DNA to be anti-oil and natural gas. This is a recipe for more price hikes which price controls will not stem but rather exacerbate as shortages become obvious and the classic \"too few goods along with too much money\" takes over again.   Americans couldn’t afford the first Green New Deal and could not weather a second. The electorate does not want price controls or expanding government. It favors the production of domestic energy. And it stands broadly and vociferously behind Israel and is dismayed by the on-again-off-again sham that Biden-Harris has orchestrated when it comes to support for Israel over the months since 10/7.   CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION         \n        \n       A starker choice is hard to imagine between going left and farther left still under Harris or back to the Trump economy combined with the full-throated words and deeds backing Israel that marked Trump’s tenure.     Video     Harris has closed the polling gap created by Biden’s manifest decline, but focus on her agenda has just begun. She is the most radical major party candidate in modern America. Anyone who has followed her career, her roots in San Francisco politics, her voting record in the Senate and her presidential campaign in 2019 knows this.   She and her team are now engaged in a great effort at misdirection, but it cannot help but display its leader’s real self, as she already has done on Israel, price controls and massive federal spending in pursuit of electoral power.       \n        \n       Her election would be catastrophic for the country and that doesn’t even contemplate her scores of judicial appointments or reduction in defense spending. Donald Trump has a record. Its strengths were on deregulation, stable prices, energy independence and energy exports and support for Israel. The evasions by Harris, her attempted repudiation of everything she campaigned on in 2019, and her manifest insecurity — leading to her refusal to speak to the press — tell all.       CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Harris, already on tape after tape defending Bidenomics, had one shot at distancing herself from the ruinous economic policy of the Biden-Harris years. She face-planted.     Harris would never have won the nomination had President Biden not stepped aside in the fashion he did and at the time forced upon him by his disastrous debate and obvious physical decline. Harris’ radical politics are just as obvious as was Biden’s infirmity, and legacy media is covering up her radicalism just as it covered Biden’s slide into incoherence.      \n        \n       What is obvious: She ought never to be president. The country and its allies simply cannot afford that.  Hugh Hewitt is host of \"The Hugh Hewitt Show,\" heard weekday mornings 6am to 9am ET on the Salem Radio Network, and simulcast on Salem News Channel.

        "title": "Yousaf demands action from PM over Tory Party ‘riddled with Islamophobia’",
        "description": "Humza Yousaf called on Rishi Sunak to instigate an external review of Islamophobia within the Conservative Party following MP Lee Anderson’s comments.",
        "text": "Scotland’s First Minister has called on  Rishi Sunak  to “lead from the front” and tackle  Islamophobia  within the Conservative Party in the wake of “despicable” comments made by MP  Lee Anderson . Humza Yousaf  insisted the “Conservative Party is riddled with Islamophobia” as he demanded the Prime Minister instigate an independent, external review of the issue. His comments come in the wake of remarks made by former deputy Conservative Party chair Mr Anderson, who lost the Tory whip at the weekend after failing to apologise for claiming “Islamists” had “got control” of  Sadiq Khan  and London. With Mr Yousaf revealing he had spoken to SNP MSP John Mason after being “deeply concerned” about comments his backbencher had made that were perceived to be antisemitic, the First Minister condemned Mr Sunak for failing to tackle Islamophobia within the Conservative Party. The fact that an MP thinks it is acceptable to make such Islamophobic comments against anybody, let alone the Mayor of London, I think is despicable Humza Yousaf The SNP leader branded Mr Anderson’s comments as being “really explicit Islamophobia” as he said the MP should be expelled from the party. Mr Anderson’s comments are “a further demonstration of the fact that Islamophobia is normalised”, Mr Yousaf said. He added: “You can look at any one of the tweets that I put out, or any one of the social media posts I put out, and you will see streams of Islamophobic abuse. “The fact that an MP thinks it is acceptable to make such Islamophobic comments against anybody, let alone the Mayor of London, I think is despicable. “I think the Conservative Party should be investigating what, I think, is clearly structural Islamophobia within that party.” Mr Yousaf said he was “in full solidarity” with fellow Muslim Mr Khan as he called on the Tories to take tough action against Mr Anderson. “He shouldn’t be allowed to continue to stand for the Conservatives, he shouldn’t just be suspended, he should be expelled from the party.” Mr Sunak has denied there is a problem with Islamophobia in his party, with the Prime Minister insisting that “racism or prejudice of any kind” is “completely unacceptable” and “not British”. Mr Sunak stated: “Lee’s comments weren’t acceptable, they were wrong. And that’s why he had the whip suspended.” The Prime Minister continued: “Clearly his choice of words wasn’t acceptable, it was wrong.” Referencing a newspaper piece by former home secretary Suella Braverman, in which she said that Islamists “are in charge of Britain now”, Mr Yousaf said those “disgraceful” comments “to me highlights that the Conservatives have got a real problem with Islamophobia”. Mr Yousaf said: “The Prime Minister’s response to not just Lee Anderson’s comments but Suella Braverman’s despicable comments has been that he hasn’t shown leadership on this issue. “I would urge him to allow an external review into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. “The Prime Minister has to lead from the front, he’s the Prime Minister, it is his party that is under scrutiny for unacceptable Islamophobia, he should be instructing an externally-led review into Islamophobia within the Conservative Party.” Mr Yousaf spoke out as he campaigned in Glasgow ahead of an upcoming council by-election, where he was joined by SNP MSP Mr Mason, who came under fire after he used a debate on the situation in Gaza to question if it was “not antisemitic for some to say that the present Israeli offensive has been over the top and has possibly crossed the line from defence to revenge”. The SNP leader said he had spoken to Mr Mason about those comments and had also spoken to leading figures within the Jewish community. The First Minister said: “They were not acceptable remarks, but he clarified what he was meaning and gave an apology alongside that.” He added: “John Mason was asked by the Jewish community, who I spoke to on Friday, to apologise and to clarify his remarks. “He has apologised and clarified his remarks, he has done exactly what was asked of him.” A Conservative Party spokesman said: “An investigation and subsequent independent review, both conducted over several years by Professor Swaran Singh, found no evidence of institutional racism in the Conservative Party.”",

        "text": "The second night of the Democratic National Convention wrapped up with back-to-back barnburners from the Obamas, who  both addressed excited attendees —but also the nation—in  a pair of powerful speeches  that had the crowd at Chicago's United Center on their feet. Before the keynotes, the delegates of the  Democratic Party  excitedly cast their votes for the ceremonial roll call on Tuesday, complete with a full DJ set that set the normally dull piece of political machinery to songs specific to each state. Even the Atlanta rapper  Lil Jon made an appearance  to rally the Georgia delegation. Lil Jon makes a surprise appearance at the  #DNC  for Georgia's roll call  pic.twitter.com/okirJaGfqY — philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_)  August 21, 2024 \n Though Vice President  Kamala Harris  was not at the convention on Day 2— she was hosting a rally  a state away, in Wisconsin—the nominee continued to build on the  Democrats ' big tent as marquee names took the stage to endorse her as the party's nominee. Here are four of the biggest takeaways of the night: Trump vs. Future Democrats continued to try to thread the needle of attacking former President  Donald Trump , who has tormented the party over the last nine years, and moving forward as a party focused on the future. Almost every speaker on Tuesday's stage  touched on Trump  while trying to position Harris as the face of a new America—one that leaves Trump in the past. \n \n Former first lady Michelle Obama speaks on stage during the second day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center on August 20, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois.  \n Former first lady Michelle Obama speaks on stage during the second day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center on August 20, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois.  \n Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images \n      Even  Michelle Obama , who famously said \"When they go low, we go high\" at the 2016 convention, tweaked her famous catchphrase to: \"When they go low, we call it out.\" While attacking Trump for \"failing forward,\" the former first lady told the crowd: \"Kamala Harris is more than ready for this moment. She is one of most qualified people ever to seek the office of the presidency.\" \"Kamala has shown allegiance to this nation not by spewing anger but by living life of service, pushing doors of opportunity to others,\" she said. \"Most will never be given grace of falling forward, benefiting from affirmative action of generational wealth. If we bankrupt a business or choke in a crisis, we don't get a 2nd, 3rd, 4th chance.\" A Focus on Republican Defectors Tuesday's programming featured several prominent  Republicans , and even a top ex-Trump official, who all  showed up in Chicago to back Harris'  presidential bid. Republican political commentator  Ana Navarro  served as the celebrity host of the convention's second day. In a passionate speech, Navarro, a vocal Trump critic, compared the former president to \"communist dictators\" including Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega, Cuba's Castro brothers and Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela. \n \n Political commentator Ana Navarro speaks on stage during the second day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center on August 20, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois.  \n Political commentator Ana Navarro speaks on stage during the second day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center on August 20, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois.  \n Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images \n      Also in attendance was former Trump White House press secretary  Stephanie Grisham , who slammed her former boss on the stage, and John Giles, the  Republican  mayor of Mesa, Arizona. \"Unlike my boss, I never wanted to stand at that podium and lie,\" Grisham said of Trump. \"Now here I am behind a podium advocating for a Democrat, and that's because I love my country more than my party. Kamala Harris tells the truth. She respects the American people, and she has my vote.\" Giles began his speech by \"confessing\" that he is a lifelong Republican but, to cheers, he announced that, \"I feel more at home here than in today's  Republican Party ,\" which he said had become \"the cult of Donald Trump.\" Other Republicans, including former Representative  Adam Kinzinger , former Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan and former Trump aide Olivia Troye, are also expected to take the stage later this week. The 'Big Tent' Party Democrats have long been known as the \"big tent\" party, home to everyone from leftists like AOC to centrists like the Clintons. On Tuesday, Harris garnered vocal support from some of the most influential voices on the left: Senator  Bernie Sanders  and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker. In a speech focused on the working class, Sanders spoke about raising the minimum wage, taxing the rich, expanding Medicaid and increasing Social Security benefits. The Vermont Independent also joined other progressives who have already called for a ceasefire in Gaza from the convention stage, finishing his remarks by insisting that the U.S. help \"end this horrific war in Gaza, bring home the hostages, and demand an immediate ceasefire.\" \n \n Former President Barack Obama speaks on stage during the second day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center on August 20, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois.  \n Former President Barack Obama speaks on stage during the second day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center on August 20, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois.  \n Andrew Harnik/Getty Images \n      Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune turned hero of the left, poked fun at Trump's wealth during his remarks, telling the crowd to \"take it from an actual billionaire,\" before declaring that \"Trump is only rich in one thing—stupidity.\" Harris also rallied the backing of the party's two biggest voices: Barack and Michelle Obama, who both delivered powerful speeches endorsing the vice president. Democrats Set On Their Winning Issue Democrats learned just how much of a winning issue reproductive rights are for the party in the 2022 midterms—now they're intent on making it their top plank for November's election. Tuesday's programming heavily emphasized what a second Trump term would mean for women across the nation. On the second night of the  DNC , major political figures, Democratic voters and campaign ads all told personal stories about how restrictive post- Roe  abortion policies have or could have impacted their lives. Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth, a former Army helicopter pilot who lost both legs in Iraq, told her in vitro fertilization story on the stage, asking: \"How dare the GOP endanger the dreams of countless veterans whose combat wounds prevent them from having kids without IVF.\" Kansas Governor Laura Kelly spoke about how voters in her conservative-leaning state shut down a ballot initiative that would have outlawed the right to an abortion. Kate Cox, the Texas woman who rose to national prominence for suing her home state for an emergency abortion, helped cast Texas' vote in the ceremonial roll call. \"If I didn't get an abortion, it would put a future pregnancy at risk. But Trump didn't care, and because of his abortion bans I had to flee my home,\" Cox said from the convention floor. \"There's nothing pro-family about abortion bans. There's nothing pro-life about letting women suffer and even die.\" \"Today, because I found a way to access abortion care, I am pregnant again and my baby is due in January, just in time to see Kamala Harris sworn in as president of the United States,\" she said. And while all this was happening in Chicago, Harris was in Milwaukee—at the same arena where the GOP held its convention last month—hitting Trump on the issue. \"Just yesterday, when he was asked if he has any regrets about ending  Roe v. Wade , Donald Trump, Donald Trump—without even a moment's hesitation, you would think he would reflect on it for at least a second—said no. No regrets,\" Harris told the rally. \"I do believe that bad behavior should result in a consequence. Now we will make sure he does face a consequence, and that'll be at the ballot box in November. Correction 8/27/2024 7:33 a.m. ET: This story was updated to note Nicolás Maduro is the leader of Venezuela.",

        "description": "",
        "text": "Tory  MPs have demanded that an 'anti-woke' chief constable credited with turning around a failing force be parachuted into the Met to toughen up its response to pro-Palestinian protests.  Backbenchers want Stephen Watson, who leads Greater  Manchester Police , brought down to  London  amid concerns that officers are using a light touch approach to dealing with anti-Semitism. Criticism has also been levelled at current  Metropolitan Police  Commissioner Sir  Mark Rowley  over his refusal to ban a massive march in London on Armistice Day, which led to a violent counter demo by Far Right hooligans. James Daly, the Conservative MP for Bury North,  told the Telegraph : 'I have come to the conclusion that a Stephen Watson-run Metropolitan Police would be far more proactive in enforcing the criminal law and would not tolerate some of the anti-social behaviours we have seen on the capital's streets which at present appear to be going unchecked.             Backbenchers want Stephen Watson, who leads Greater Manchester Police, brought down to London amid concerns that officers are using a light touch approach to dealing with anti-Semitism.             Criticism has also been levelled at current Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley over his refusal to ban a massive march in London on Armistice Day, which led to a violent counter demo by Far Right hooligans.             The protests continued this weekend. Picftuired is a protestor waving a flag near Trafalgar Square yesterday                             'Stephen Watson is the type of police officer I came across when I first started practising in the courts. Whatever the type of offence, if the evidence is there you will be arrested and prosecuted. In contrast to the previous regime in charge of policing in Greater Manchester this is a revolutionary approach. 'I believe this robust approach to criminal justice should be adopted by the Metropolitan Police, specifically in relation to the recent protests we have seen in London.' Adam Holloway, who like Mr Daly sits on the Commons Home Affairs Committee added: 'I absolutely agree with freedom of speech but this is a different order. You can't have people saying these things. We are seeing far too much woke, weak policing. What the public want and what they pay for is robust policing.' Mr Watson led Greater Manchester out of special measures in 2022 after 18 months at the helm. Regarded as an 'old school' chief who pitched himself as 'anti-woke' when he joined GMP, he blamed a 'failure of senior leadership' for its problems and promised a 'dialled up muscularity' in his approach to crime.  In the first 18 months since he took over, 999 call answer times fell from an average of one minute 22 seconds to seven seconds, response times were reduced and arrests increased by 60 per cent. He also put an emphasis on the force's public image, ordering officers to iron uniforms, cover tattoos, polish boots, tie up long hair and come into work clean-shaven. Mr Watson has previously spoken out against officers displaying rainbow badges on their uniforms as 'virtue-signalling' and said he would not take the knee like other police bosses.",

        "title": "Nearly HALF of Americans see migration at the southern border as a serious issue - with 7% spike from May to now in those who say it's a 'crisis'",
        "description": "",
        "text": "A growing number of Americans are concerned with spiking migration at the southern border – with 75 percent calling it a 'crisis' or 'very serious' problem, according to the latest polling. Those who feel the situation at the border is a 'crisis' is on the rise from the spring, when just 38 percent called it a 'crisis' in May compared to the 45 percent who now feel the same. The latest figures come amid a massive rise in illegal immigration over the southern border this winter, with thousands at a time lining up to be processed by Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Meanwhile, reports emerged last week showing that CBP is on track this month to process the most migrants in the agency's history with more than 304,000 encounters in a single month.             A new poll shows that 75% of Americans feel that the situation at the southern border is either a 'crisis' or 'very serious'             It comes as a record number of migrants are arriving at the border every month – including December being on track for the highest-ever number of illegal arrivals at 304,000               A new  CBS News/YouGov poll  finds that 18 percent think the  border crisis  is just 'somewhat serious' and another 7 percent think what's going on at the southern border is 'not much of a problem at all.' More respondents disagree with how President  Joe Biden  is handling the southern border compared to how  congressional  Republicans are handling it. It comes as the Biden administration attempts to deflect blame for the ongoing crisis to Congress, with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas intervening with negotiations in the Senate. Republicans want to see a complete overhaul of the U.S. immigration system, with more strict regulations on illegal border crossers. They are even threatening to hold hostage more aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan in exchange for getting a comprehensive bill passed on making it easier to deport illegal immigrants.             The latest shows that the sentiment of the border being in 'crisis' has risen by 7% since May Meanwhile, new proposed rules would essentially re-implement pandemic-era Title 42, which allowed CBP agents to immediately deport back to Mexico migrants claiming asylum while their proceedings were underway – instead of releasing them into the country to await a court date. Progressives and immigration advocates claim this is inhumane. The CBS/YouGov poll shows that 44 percent of respondents want migrants to leave the country while they wait for asylum hearings, while 43 percent say they feel migrants should remain in the U.S. while they wait. Meanwhile, 13 percent say that they want the migrants to be booted from the country with no chance of being able to return.",

        "description": "The Prime Minister travelled to Kyiv on Friday to unveil the new funding, becoming the first foreign leader to visit Ukraine this year.",
        "text": "Volodymyr Zelensky  has hailed the UK’s £2.5 billion military aid package for  Ukraine , as  Rishi Sunak  promised to continue to stand with the country in its fight against Russia. The  Prime Minister  travelled to  Kyiv  on Friday to unveil the new funding, becoming the first foreign leader to visit Ukraine this year. With an increase of £200 million on the last two years, the military support comes at a crucial time for President Zelensky amid fears that interest is flagging among allies as the war drags on. The two leaders also signed a new security agreement, committing the UK to provide “swift and sustained” assistance if Ukraine is ever attacked by Russia again. In a speech alongside Mr Zelensky, the Prime Minister said the new security partnership “will last a hundred years or more”. “Be in no doubt: We are not walking away, ours is the unbreakable alliance,” he said. Mr Sunak arrived in Kyiv by train on Friday morning before visiting an apartment block in the capital badly damaged by debris from a Russian missile earlier this month. Mr Zelensky hailed Mr Sunak’s “personal leadership” and said the agreement would lay “the groundwork for our further work with our other partners”. The UK is the first country to sign a final security agreement with Ukraine, after G7 countries agreed at last year’s Nato summit to sign bilateral security assurances with the country. Mr Sunak told a press conference that “our opponents around the world believe that we have neither the patience nor the resources for long wars”. If Putin wins in Ukraine, he will not stop there, and our opponents around the world believe that we have neither the patience nor resources for long wars. So waver now and we embolden not just Putin, but his allies in North Korea, Iran and elsewhere Prime Minister Rishi Sunak He said: “Ukraine is not alone, and Ukraine will never be alone. Putin might think that he can outlast us but he is wrong. We stand with you today, tomorrow and for as long as it takes. “Because this war is about Ukraine’s right to defend itself and to determine your own future and the Ukrainian people’s historic choice to be an independent democracy at the heart of Europe. “Your quest for freedom has inspired and moved the British people and for the free nations of the world aid to Ukraine is also an investment in our own collective security. “Because if Putin wins in Ukraine, he will not stop there, and our opponents around the world believe that we have neither the patience nor resources for long wars. So waver now and we embolden not just Putin, but his allies in North Korea, Iran and elsewhere.” Number 10 said the £2.5 billion in funding would cover long-range missiles, air defence, artillery ammunition and maritime security. Around £200 million will also be spent on a push to procure and produce thousands of military drones, which the Government said was the largest delivery of drones to Ukraine from any nation. Most are expected to be manufactured in the UK. The meeting between the two leaders saw Mr Sunak awarded the Ukrainian order of freedom, an honour also bestowed on his predecessor Boris Johnson. The UK has been among the most vocal backers of Ukraine since the war began, with Mr Zelensky visiting London early last year in a historic trip. The Ukraine leader has previously said that the country particularly needs air defence systems to fend off Russian aerial barrages. More than 500 drones and missiles were fired between December 29 and January 2, according to officials in Kyiv. But there have been concerns that global focus on the war has moved, as the crisis in the Middle East continues to escalate and concerns grow about the fate of civilians in Gaza. The Prime Minister’s visit came hours after UK and US forces launched strikes against targets used by Houthi rebels in Yemen in a bid to disrupt attacks on commercial shipping. Mr Sunak met with Ukrainian emergency workers during the visit, with a further £18 million in aid also announced for the country. {\"data\":{\"id\":\"1745819778579595752\"}} Funding and resources would also be provided for English language training in Ukraine, Number 10 said. Labour backed the “vital support” for Ukraine, as Sir Keir Starmer urged the need for politicians to remain united on the issue. “I think it’s really important that we keep our focus on Ukraine,” he said. “We have had cross-party support for Ukraine for a very long time and we need to maintain that in the face of Russian aggression that has been going on for a long time now,” the Labour leader said. “I’m supportive of what the Prime Minister is saying today and we will remain united across our political parties in defence of Ukraine against that aggression from Putin.”",

        "title": "Will Super Tuesday put the primary season out of its misery? 3 things I expect to see.",
        "text": "Super Tuesday might not be the end of the primary elections, but it could be a turning point in the nomination process.  Fifteen states  and one U.S. territory have elections. Based on what we’ve seen, I'm expecting to see a string of victories for President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.  Still, there are a few things to pay attention to as we shift into a full-blown election year. We’ve seen enough of the primary season that we can anticipate some of what will happen on Super Tuesday. Voters know it's going to be Trump and Biden in the end, just like 2020. It's a rematch that no one wants – Biden's  popularity is waning , Trump's legal battles aren't over and both are showing their age. If your state heads to the polls Tuesday, it's the last chance to make your voice heard before the general election kicks off. It could also get us closer to ending this miserable primary season. Former South Carolina Gov.  Nikki Haley  finally has some points on the board after winning Sunday’s Republican primary in Washington, D.C. She now has 19 delegates, bringing her  grand total to 43  ahead of Super Tuesday. Trump is still dominating  with 244 delegates , and the Supreme Court just ruled that he can remain on the ballot in Colorado and Maine, which are among the  states voting on Super Tuesday . It’s unlikely that Haley’s win this weekend will have a huge impact on her standing in the Super Tuesday states.  Fewer than 2,000 Washingtonians voted  in the Republican primary, and Haley has already been declared “Queen of the Swamp”  by the Trump campaign . It’s likely that what little momentum she has at this point will fizzle out after votes come in Tuesday night, even though it’s unclear what her plans are going forward. Why not Haley?  Nikki Haley dominates Biden in polls. Why are Republican primary voters so stuck on Trump? Whether she stays in the race  will depend on her finances . She brought in $12 million in February, despite her electoral losses, but that won't last her until July. Even so, Haley's offering Republican voters a choice instead of letting Trump cruise to victory, and that's admirable. Hopefully, she sticks to her morals and stays in the race. On the Democratic side, Michigan’s  100,000 “uncommitted” voters  showed progressives in other states an option for voicing their discontent over Biden’s handling of the conflict in Gaza.  Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who is Palestinian American,  was a vocal supporter of the protest vote  and likely had a hand in its success in her state's primary. There isn’t a comparable Democrat leading the charge in other states on Super Tuesday, but there is an effort from the  Democratic Socialists of America  to popularize the uncommitted vote in other states.  Vice President Kamala Harris called for an “ immediate cease-fire ” of six weeks or more during a speech in Selma, Alabama, this weekend, but it won’t make a difference in the minds of voters who want to see the Biden administration do more to ease the humanitarian crisis facing Palestinians. It’s also unlikely that other states will see protest votes comparable to Michigan, but it’s still something the campaign should make note of after Tuesday’s results are in. Biden is wasting TikTok:  I don't want my president to be a TikTok influencer. Biden is wasting time making jokes. What the Democratic Party fails to understand is that other like-minded voters are expressing their frustration with a war that they want no part in ahead of November. It does not mean these voters are sitting out altogether, just that they want to express their discontent with the current relationship between the United States and Israel. The campaign could ignore these voters, but I don't see how that would help the campaign in the long run. The presidential primaries this year have had mixed turnout results. Voter turnout was  lower than previous years in Michigan , as well as  Iowa’s Republican primary  and  South Carolina’s Democratic primary . Other races, like the Republican primaries in  New Hampshire  and  South Carolina , saw a record number of voters.  With the potential of some newfound Haley momentum and the push among progressives to consider the uncommitted vote, it’s possible that young people will affect the elections on Super Tuesday. Voters ages 18-29 had a higher turnout in the  2020 Democratic primaries  than previous competitive primaries, but there isn’t data on the Republican contests for that year.  It’s possible that young voters stay at home due to the definitive nature that has accompanied both Republican and Democratic primaries – though there are important primaries down the ballot that could have more of an impact on abortion rights and crime within their states. It’s also possible that Haley’s win in Washington or the push for more uncommitted votes encourage young voters to show up on Super Tuesday. Personally, I'm ready for things to be finalized. Both Trump and Biden are acting as though they are the two nominees, and mainstream media outlets reflect this. Hopefully, once the primaries are done, we can start talking more about things such as the economy, abortion access and immigration. Trump hasn't even picked a running mate. Until the general election is underway, it's going to be difficult for either presumed nominee to make a case for themselves. Let's fast-forward to that.

        "text": "LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) — Slovenian officials on Friday praised a  landmark East-West prisoner exchange  in which the tiny Alpine state participated by handing over two convicted Russian sleeper agents following secretive planning and negotiations with U.S. officials.  The United States and Russia on Thursday completed their biggest prisoner swap in post-Soviet history, with Moscow releasing journalist  Evan Gershkovich  and fellow American  Paul Whelan , along with dissidents including  Vladimir Kara-Murza , in a multinational deal that set two dozen people free. Among those exchanged was the Russian couple who posed as Argentine citizens after settling in  Slovenia  in 2017. The husband, who used the name Ludwig Gisch, ran a startup IT company. The wife, who had fake documents in the name of Maria Rosa Mayer Muños, had an online art gallery. Their actual names are Artem Dultsev and Anna Dultseva. \n     \n\n The couple reportedly used the Slovenian capital as their base to travel to neighboring NATO and EU member states, relay orders from Moscow and bring money to other Russian sleeper agents. They were arrested in December 2022.  \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n             \n                 \n                    RELATED COVERAGE\n                 \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Germany says sanctions against Syrian war crimes suspects must stay but people need relief \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Lebanese whose homes were destroyed in the war want to rebuild.

Although the couple had categorically denied the spying charges since their arrest, they suddenly changed their narrative on Wednesday. The couple’s two teenage children, who had lived in foster care after their parents’ 2022 arrest, were on a CIA plane that took them from Ljubljana to the Turkish capital, Ankara, where the exchange took place. \n     \n\n Photos released after they landed in Moscow showed them being greeted by Russian President Vladimir Putin along with the other freed Russian nationals. “Due to the fact that some activities are still going on, the time for an analysis of their role will come in the future,” senior Slovenian security official Vojko Volf told reporters on Friday. “I do not doubt they were very, very important.” Slovenian President Natasa Pirc Musar praised the way the exchange operation was conducted. “Slovenia and its intelligence agencies worked tirelessly and with great sensitivity with our allies and partners in prisoner exchange which successfully concluded yesterday,” she said on X. “I would like to pay respect and compliment everyone involved in this difficult action that saved lives.” U.S. President Joe Biden has thanked U.S. allies, including Slovenia, for the major prisoner swap. “I am grateful to our Allies who stood with us throughout tough, complex negotiations to achieve this outcome — including Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway, and Turkey,” Biden wrote on X.",

        "text": "CHICAGO (AP) — Pro-Palestinian demonstrators blocked roadways in Illinois, California, New York and the Pacific Northwest on Monday, temporarily shutting down travel into some of the nation’s most heavily used airports, onto the Golden Gate and Brooklyn bridges and on a busy West Coast highway.  In Chicago, protesters linked arms and blocked lanes of Interstate 190 leading into O’Hare International Airport around 7 a.m. in a demonstration they said was part of a global “economic blockade to free Palestine,” according to Rifqa Falaneh, one of the organizers.  Traffic in the San Francisco Bay Area was snarled for hours as demonstrators shut down all vehicle, pedestrian and bike traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge and chained themselves to 55-gallon drums filled with cement across Interstate 880 in Oakland. Protesters marching into Brooklyn blocked Manhattan-bound traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge. In Eugene, Oregon, protesters blocked Interstate 5, shutting down traffic on the major highway for about 45 minutes. \n     \n\n Protesters say they chose O’Hare in part because it is one of the largest airports. Among other things, they’ve called for an immediate  cease-fire  in the war between Israel and Hamas. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n             \n                 \n                    RELATED COVERAGE\n                 \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Conflict between Turkey and Kurdish groups rises around key dam in northern Syria \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Venezuelan opposition leader emerges from hideout to protest Maduro’s plans to cling to power \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Mozambique opposition leader returns from self-imposed exile as police fire tear gas at supporters \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Anti-  war  protesters have demonstrated in Chicago near daily since  Hamas’ Oct. 7  attack on southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people. Israeli warplanes and ground troops have since conducted a scorched-earth campaign on the Gaza Strip. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n The Israeli offensive has killed more than 33,700 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry. The ministry  does not differentiate  between civilians and combatants in its count but says  women and children  make up two-thirds of the dead. O’Hare warned travelers on the social platform X to take alternative forms of transportation with car travel “substantially delayed this morning due to protest activity.” \n     \n\n Some travelers stuck in standstill traffic left their cars and walked the final leg to the airport along the freeway, trailing their luggage behind them. Among them was Madeline Hannan from suburban Chicago. She was headed to O’Hare for a work trip to Florida when her and her husband’s car ended up stalled for 20 minutes. She got out and “both ran and speed walked” more than a mile (1.6 kilometers). She said she made it to the gate on time, but barely. “This was an inconvenience,” she said in a telephone interview from Florida. “But in the grand scheme of things going on overseas, it’s a minor inconvenience.” While individual travelers may have been affected, operations at the airport appeared near normal with delays of under 15 minutes, according to the Chicago Department of Aviation. Inbound traffic toward O’Hare resumed around 9 a.m. Near Seattle, the Washington State Department of Transportation said a demonstration closed the main road to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Social media posts showed people holding a banner and waving Palestinian flags while standing on the highway, which reopened about three hours later.  About 20 protesters were arrested at the Golden Gate Bridge demonstration and traffic resumed shortly after noon, according to the California Highway Patrol. The agency said officers were making arrests at two points on the interstate, including one spot where roughly 300 protesters refused orders to disperse,  \n     \n\n “Attempting to block or shut down a freeway or state highway to protest is unlawful, dangerous, and prevents motorists from safely reaching their destinations,” the agency said in a statement.  Oregon State Police said 52 protestors were were arrested for disorderly conduct following the Interstate 5 protest in Eugene, Oregon, about 110 miles (177 kilometers) south of Portland. Six vehicles were towed from the scene. New York Police made numerous arrests, saying 150 protesters were initially involved in the march around 3:15 p.m., but that number quickly grew. The bridge was fully reopened by 5 p.m. In Chicago, dozens of protesters were arrested, according to Falaneh. Chicago police said Monday that “multiple people” were taken into custody after a protest where people obstructed traffic, but they did not have a detailed count. ___ Associated Press writers Janie Har in San Francisco, Claire Rush in Portland, Oregon; Pat Eaton-Robb in Hartford, Connecticut and Audrey McAvoy in Honolulu contributed to this report.",

The new book \"Light For Today: 365 Daily Devotions from the Lighthouse\" was a labor of love — to see God in the everyday challenges of life and to reconcile the inner pains and normal stresses with the God who said, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\"         \n        \n       It was a natural postlude  to my first book , \"Lighthouse Faith: God as a Living Reality in a World Immersed in Fog.\" This devotional, you could say, is the practical application of what was presented in the first book. The lighthouse is a great symbol of refuge and strength, a beacon of hope in darkness. In that way, it's packed with symbolism and metaphors.     BIBLE FULL OF HISTORICAL EVIDENCE FOR HOW EFFECTIVE PRAYER IS, STRESSES FAITH LEADER       \n        \n       But it is also so much more. The lighthouse, its actual structure, seems to be  God's logo stamped  on every part of creation, from the planets in heaven to nature and the animals and, of course all of us, who are made in His image.     So how is the lighthouse God's logo?     \"Light for Today: 365 Daily Devotions from the Lighthouse\" by Lauren Green has just been published. It is available in multiple formats on Amazon.   (Amazon) Because it is so incredibly like God's law, the Ten Commandments. These laws are not just an arbitrary set of rules and regulations to keep us in line, but an actual description of who God is ... And who we are meant to live out our lives as His image bearers.     \n        \n       Of course, it's a lot harder to do than to say. The First Commandment is the hinge:  \"I am the Lord your God  … You shall not have any gods before me.\"     It's a simple command that is both an edict and a statement of truth. And like all God's commands, they are motivated by love. \"God knows how we are made and how best we can live joyful, meaningful lives.\"            \n        \n       It's a command because God knows how we are made and how best we can live joyful, meaningful lives.  EASTER IS ABOUT GOD'S LOVE AND SHOULD NOT BE ‘DOMESTICATED,’ SAYS BISHOP ROBERT BARRON It's a statement of truth, as there are no other gods but God. And anything we put in God's place is a false idol.          \n        \n       Turns out idolatry is our biggest problem. Or, as one theologian noted, it's about \"disordered loves.\"     Tybee Island Lighthouse, a historic lighthouse with colonial era ties near Savannah, Georgia. \"The lighthouse, its actual structure, seems to be God's logo stamped on every part of creation, from the planets in heaven to nature and the animals and, of course, all of us, who are made in His image.\"   (iStock) For example, you can't commit adultery unless someone else's love means more than God's love. You can't steal unless something else is more valuable to you than God. So all the laws are identified first by their relationship to the First Commandment — and second by their relationship to each other. It's the horizontal and the vertical of the cross. \"Scripture tells us that God is love … God didn't create love. He IS Love.\"       \n        \n       What you have here is a simple and rudimentary, closed system. It's a seminal point that everything in the system relates to first, and then second to everything else in the system.          MOVIE PRODUCER OF ‘CABRINI’ RESPONDS TO CRITICS THAT FILM FAILS TO SHOW NUN'S FAITH MOTIVATION We see this repeated in architecture with a right triangle, in biology with the structure of the cell, and in music with the diatonic scale.     \n        \n       So what does that have to do with love and a devotional as a labor of love?  Scripture tells us that God is love. First John: \"God is love.\" Yes, God loves — but He is love itself. He is the Author, the Headwaters, the Fountainhead, the Source itself.      \"We are all vulnerable to spiritual attacks. Satan’s purpose is to draw us away from God — to make us put our fundamental and foundational trust in something other than God.\"   (iStock)     It means God didn't create love. He IS Love.     \n        \n       So if God is love, what are the implications? Lots! We think of love as purely emotional, even irrational. But God's love is far more complex. \"When God said, ‘Let there be light,’ it was out of love.\"        If God is love, it means that all creation — all its laws, and scientific principles, the periodic table that science discovered, the strong and the weak forces, gravity, quantum physics, the motion of the planets — are products of God's love.         \n        \n       Which means God's love, first and foremost, creates order.  AMID POST-EASTER CULTURE WARS, JESUS STILL ASKS, ‘BUT WHO DO YOU SAY THAT I AM?’ When God said, \"Let there be light,\" it was out of love.      \n        \n       God didn't just create a dwelling place for us. He created a home for us — a loving home. Under spiritual attack     And yes, this order is under spiritual attack. Just look at what's happening in the world —  crime, protests, violence .  All of it has a spiritual component. And this spiritual attack has existed almost from the very beginning of time.         \n        \n       We are all vulnerable to spiritual attacks. Satan’s purpose is to draw us away from God, to make us put our fundamental and foundational trust in something other than God.     \"Yes, this order is under spiritual attack. Just look at what's happening in the world — crime, protests, violence. All of it has a spiritual component.\"   (Getty Images) The Bible warns us constantly about these spiritual battles.     \"Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil\" (Ephesians 6).     \n        \n       \"For though we walk in the flesh, we are not waging war according to the flesh\" (2 Corinthians 10). \"The Bible warns us constantly about these spiritual battles.\"   \"Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour\" (1 Peter 5). PASSOVER HOLDS THE KEY TO COMPREHENDING TODAY'S ‘VICIOUS ANTISEMITISM,’ SAYS RABBI AND SPIRITUAL LEADER         \n        \n       Satan's goal is to not only make you distrust God, but in that distrust, to turn away from the source of love that we all want and crave.  3 important points about spiritual attacks     There are three things that are very important to remember about spiritual attacks. They usually come from someone or something familiar to us. A lot of times they focus on our strengths, not our weaknesses. To do the greatest damage, they happen when we are at our weakest, emotionally or physically. Here's a deeper dive into these three points. 1. Spiritual attacks often come from those familiar to us     \n        \n       The best example of No. 1 is where it all began, the original sin, the fall from grace in the Garden of Eden.      There, Eve and Adam are enjoying this beautiful relationship with God. And God tells them that they can eat anything in this beautiful garden — except, \"do not eat of the one tree in the middle.\"     \"If you don’t trust God, you're automatically putting your trust in something else.\"   (iStock) Things start to go downhill quickly; remember Eve’s encounter with the serpent. Big questions surround modern folks living in a technologically advanced world.      \n        \n       Why is Eve talking to a serpent? And why is a serpent talking? JEWISH GROUP FOR PASSOVER INTRODUCES 'TEN PLAGUES OF ANTISEMITISM' IN ITS HAGGADAH THIS YEAR         These are the wrong questions.      \n        \n       Because the Bible is much more a story of the \"why\" than the \"how.\" The real issue here is that Eve is not surprised by the serpent's presence. She is not afraid of him talking to her. She does not run.  What does that tell you? This was probably not their first conversation. They may have even had many talks before — might have even been friends.  \"Eve can’t recognize the evil intent because it’s not coming from an enemy. It’s coming from a friend.\"           \n        \n       But at a crucial time regarding the one \"don’t\" that God gave to her and Adam, this is where the serpent's deception does the real damage: \"Did God actually say...?\" Eve can’t recognize the evil intent because it’s not coming from an enemy. It’s coming from a friend. And his deceit is with a harmless phrase: \"Did God actually say…?\"          \n        \n       It was a twisting of God's words to mean something other than their true intent.     If you don’t trust God, you're automatically putting your trust in something else.  Where is Eve putting her trust if it's not in God? It's in her own ability to judge what is right and wrong — what is good and what is evil.     \"Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil\" (Ephesians 6).   (iStock)     \n        \n       This begins the breakdown of her relationship with Adam. She gives him the forbidden fruit.  And instead of owning up to his violating the command, he blames Eve — and then blames God for giving him Eve.     He now calls her, \"That woman!\" Not even recognizing the wife, the one he first called \"bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh.\"     \n        \n       PASSOVER BRISKET: HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR'S RECIPE HOLDS ‘SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE’ AMID JEWISH HOLIDAY     The family breakdown started here, as neither of them put their ultimate trust in God.   And the rest, as they say, is history. 2. Our strengths are often prime targets of spiritual attacks     Our strengths tend to become our identities. They are talents, gifts from God.  But they can also be a source of great pride and illusions about their ultimate value. Let's take  the very successful Taylor Swift  as one example. \"Good things that become ultimate things become our reason for being — and they are prime for spiritual attacks.\"   She's an extremely talented singer, songwriter and poet. She's also quite beautiful — and has become astonishingly prosperous, with a net worth estimated to be $1.1 billion.   Her latest album , though, has drawn criticism from some Christian leaders, who say that \"it mocks God and Christians.\" One example cited in a recent Christian Post article says, \"In the song ‘Guilty As Sin,’ Swift sings, 'What if I roll the stone away? / They're gonna crucify me anyway / What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy.\"       In another time, this would be labeled blasphemous for mocking the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the cornerstone of Christianity, and for making earthly romantic love equal to, or worse, better than the Love of God, the Creator.     \"Lent is a time for spiritual reflection, prayer and fasting. The 40 days commemorate how long Jesus was in the wilderness, where He was tempted by Satan.\"   (iStock)     Today, Swift is successful in every arena that the secular culture values.  In the documentary about the Eras Tour, she is heard saying, \"I just want to be on the right side of history.\"   Yet the Lord of history is more concerned about our eternity.     Good things that become ultimate things become our reason for being — and they are prime for spiritual attacks. Without offering them up to God, they can be used for our downfall.  The talent becomes the false \"hinge\" on which life hangs.   3. Spiritual attacks often happen when we're most vulnerable This week is Holy Week for  millions of Orthodox Christians , who are now focused on the climax of the Lenten season, which is Pascha (Easter, on May 5). Lent is a time for spiritual reflection, prayer and fasting. The 40 days commemorate how long Jesus was in the wilderness, where He was tempted by Satan. IN PROTESTS AGAINST ISRAEL, ‘AMERICAN WAY OF FREEDOM’ IS BEING ‘DEEPLY CHALLENGED,’ SAYS AUTHOR AND HISTORIAN           One thing to remember: The temptation came at the end of His 40 days of fasting and prayer, not at the beginning. Jesus was the weakest physically and probably emotionally.  Satan tempts Jesus with food, sustenance: \"If you're the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.\"   And Jesus answers, \"Man does not live by bread alone. But by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'\" \"Away with you, Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.'\"   He tempts Him with safety and shelter, basically saying, \"If God loved you, He'd do this or that … He wouldn't let you suffer.\"     Jesus answers, \"You shall not … tempt the Lord your God.'\" And the third temptation is money, power and prestige — about making the proverbial \"deal with the devil,\" having our heart's desire with the caveat of worshiping that desire. Jesus answers, \"Away with you, Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.'\"     CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER Notice that Satan tempts Jesus using Scripture — a twisted interpretation of Scripture, that is. Jesus responds with Scripture — its true understanding and meaning. We're always going to be faced with a challenge to our belief in God. It's the  sacred versus the secular .  The subtleties may seem harmless — but little by little, they can draw us away from God.

        "description": "The Foreign Secretary said suspending export licences that could be used by Israel against Houthi rebels would lead to a ‘wider war’.",
        "text": "David Lammy  has insisted imposing a full arms embargo on  Israel  would be a “mistake” but left the door open to further sanctions over settler violence in the  West Bank . The Foreign Secretary suggested suspending export licences that could be used by Israel against  Houthi  rebels and other proxies in the region would lead to a “wider war”. But speaking at a  Labour Party  conference fringe event on Sunday, he said he was in talks with G7 allies about responding to “deeply” concerning “escalatory behaviour” in the occupied region.  I'm not announcing further sanctions today, but that is kept under close review David Lammy “I’m deeply, deeply worried by the growing violence and settler violence that we see in the West Bank,” Mr Lammy said. “I’m in discussions with G7 partners, particular European partners on that. I’m not announcing further sanctions today, but that is kept under close review.” It comes after Israeli president Isaac Herzog earlier on Sunday expressed disappointment in the UK’s changing position towards the country. He told Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips on Sky News: “We have outstanding relations with the British Government. We have outstanding relations with the people of Britain. “I have, personally, very close affinity with His Majesty’s Government and with Britain at large, but we also have to understand that between friends we expect friends and allies to be there for us all the time, as we are for them. “There is a sense of disappointment in Israel and I have expressed it to my friends.” Britain has subjected groups and individuals linked to violence against Palestinian communities in the West Bank to sanctions including asset freezes and travel bans in recent months. Mr Lammy’s intervention is the latest in a series of warnings over a rise in unrest in the region since last October. Elsewhere in the discussion, the Foreign Secretary was pressed by delegates on the Government’s position on arms exports, which have proven a sticking point within party ranks. The UK has suspended some export licences to Israel over concerns the country is violating international humanitarian law in Gaza, but some have argued stronger action is needed including a full arms embargo. Questioned on whether such a measure would be introduced, Mr Lammy said: “I don’t think it would be quite right to suspend licences, for example, that the Israelis could use in relation to the Houthis, that Israel may need to use in relation to the challenges it has with other proxies in the area. “I think that would be a mistake. It would lead to a wider war and an escalation that we here in the UK are committed to stopping, so I’m afraid I disagree with that position.”",

        "title": "Biden administration again bypasses Congress for weapons sale to Israel",
        "text": "Antony Blinken tells Congress he made second emergency determination covering $147.5m sale for equipment For the second time this month the  Biden administration  is bypassing Congress to approve an emergency weapons sale to Israel as Israel continues to prosecute its war against Hamas in Gaza under increasing international criticism. The state department said on Friday that the secretary of state,  Antony Blinken , had told Congress that he had made a second emergency determination covering a $147.5m sale for equipment, including fuses, chargers and primers, that is needed to make the 155mm shells that Israel has already purchased function. “Given the urgency of Israel’s defensive needs, the secretary notified Congress that he had exercised his delegated authority to determine an emergency existed necessitating the immediate approval of the transfer,” the department said. “The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to US national interests to ensure Israel is able to defend itself against the threats it faces,” it said. The emergency determination means the purchase will bypass the congressional review requirement for foreign military sales. Such determinations are rare, but not unprecedented, when administrations see an urgent need for weapons to be delivered without waiting for lawmakers’ approval. Blinken made a similar decision on 9 December, to approve the sale to Israel of nearly 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition worth more than $106m. Both moves have come as Joe Biden’s request for a nearly $106bn aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other national security needs remains stalled in Congress, caught up in a debate over US immigration policy and border security. Some Democratic lawmakers have spoken of making the proposed $14.3bn in American assistance to its Middle East ally contingent on concrete steps by the government of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to reduce civilian casualties in Gaza during the war with Hamas. The state department sought to counter potential criticism of the sale on human rights grounds by saying it was in constant touch with Israel to emphasize the importance of minimizing civilian casualties, which have soared since Israel began its response to the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October. “We continue to strongly emphasize to the government of Israel that they must not only comply with international humanitarian law, but also take every feasible step to prevent harm to civilians,” it said. “Hamas hides behind civilians and has embedded itself among the civilian population, but that does not lessen Israel’s responsibility and strategic imperative to distinguish between civilians and Hamas terrorists as it conducts its military operations,” the department said. “This type of campaign can only be won by protecting civilians.” Bypassing Congress with emergency determinations for arms sales is an unusual step that has in the past met resistance from lawmakers, who normally have a period of time to weigh in on proposed weapons transfers and, in some cases, block them. In May 2019, then secretary of state Mike Pompeo made an emergency determination for an $8.1bn sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan after it became clear that the Trump administration would have trouble overcoming lawmakers’ concerns about the Saudi and UAE-led war in Yemen. Pompeo came under heavy criticism for the move, which some believed may have violated the law because many of the weapons involved had yet to be built and could not be delivered urgently. But he was cleared of any wrongdoing after an internal investigation. At least four administrations have used the authority since 1979. President George HW Bush’s administration used it during the Gulf war to get arms quickly to Saudi Arabia.",

At 81 years old, he is the oldest president to have held office. If he is reelected in November, Biden would be 86 at the end of his second term. White House officials and allies of the president have tried to downplay concerns about Biden's age and mental capacity, but even some  Democrats   are torn on the issue . Republican primary front-runner and former President  Donald Trump , who is 77, has said that Biden  is not \"too old\"  to be president, \"he's too incompetent.\" \t Read more \n   Joe Biden's annual physical announcement sparks wave of questions \n   The Democratic Party may be stuck with Biden for good \n   Fox News links Joe Biden's ice cream habit to Alzheimer's \n   Joe Biden should endorse Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and step aside \n What We Know  According to White House Press Secretary  Karine Jean-Pierre , Biden's physician assessed during his checkup that the president \"doesn't need a cognitive test.\" The president also joked with reporters after his exam that his doctors told him that he looks \"too young.\" Wednesday's health summary comes on the heels of Special Counsel Robert Hur's report regarding the investigation into Biden's handling of classified documents, which depicted the president as an \"elderly man with a poor memory.\" The president and others in his administration have adamantly rejected the report's findings. Views Republicans often harp on Biden's public gaffes during speeches and events as a sign that his mental health is in decline. Democrats, however, have pointed out that Trump is guilty of making  similar mistakes . Polls consistently show that Americans believe that both candidates—who are likely to appear on the November ballot for their respective parties—are too old to run for a second term. In a  recent survey  conducted by Redfield & Wilton Strategies, 61 percent of voters said that they agree or strongly agree with the statement that \"President Biden is too old to seek a second term as president.\" In that same poll, 40 percent of the public agreed or strongly agreed that Trump is too old to run in November. According to Cliff Young, president of public affairs at Ipsos, polling often shows that \"Biden is really the one that is seen as having an age problem.\" \" Republicans  are much more critical of Biden's age than Democrats are critical of Trump's age,\" Young previously told  Newsweek.  Still, Biden's camp is assured that the president is ready for another four years. First lady  Jill Biden  wrote in an email to supporters in the days following Hur's report that Biden \"is 81, that's true, but he's 81 doing more in an hour than most people do in a day.\" Newsweek  reached out to Trump's campaign via email for comment on Biden's health summary on Wednesday. What's Next? Several Democrats, including prominent strategists like  David Axelrod , have raised fears that voters' perception of the president's age could cause issues in November. Biden has also lost some support among his electorate on specific policy issues, such as his  handling of the Israel-Hamas war . But the president's reelection bid remains largely unchallenged, and Biden has repeatedly dismissed concerns about his health. \"My memory's fine,\" the president said during an appearance on  Late Night with Seth Meyers  on Monday. \"Take a look at what I've done since I became president ... How did that happen? I guess I just forgot what was going on.\" Update 02/28/24, 6:31 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information and background.",

        "title": "Bye Bye Tiberias review – heartfelt memoir of Palestinian family reunion in Galilee",
        "text": "Hiam Abbass, AKA Marcia Roy from Succession, returns to the village she left 30 years ago to become an actor, with her daughter Lina Soualem behind the camera H iam Abbass is the Franco-Palestinian actor who has been a consistent presence in international cinema for more than 20 years, but cut through ultimately with her role as  Marcia Roy , wife of Brian Cox’s media potentate Logan Roy, in Jesse Armstrong’s hit HBO TV drama Succession. Now her own personal story emerges – partly – in this heartfelt cine-memoir directed by her daughter Lina Soualem, who was brought up in France. This isn’t directly a story about what Palestinians call the  Nakba  or “catastrophe”: as a young woman, Abbass left her home village of  Deir Hanna , near Tiberias on the Sea of Galilee’s western shore, to pursue an acting career in Europe. But now Soualem goes back there with Abbass to reconnect with her grandmother Nemat, Abbass’s mother, who has memories of Palestine before 1948 and the establishment of the state of Israel, and the film is an emotional multi-generational portrait. Abbass herself appears at first to have mixed feelings about this return, and is almost reticent on the subject; it was, after all, a place she yearned to leave, and where she found the patriarchal control of her destiny to be oppressive. Abbass’s Wikipedia page actually lists one spouse (divorced): the French actor Zinedine Soualem, who is Lina’s father. But Bye Bye Tiberias talks about another man in her life; an Englishman called Michael, whose second name is not revealed, who was passionately in love with Abbass long before, and who it seems offered to convert to Islam if that was what it took to get married to her. Is that what happened? Where is Michael now? It isn’t entirely clear, and you leave the film with the (actually rather intriguing) sensation that not everything has been told. Another type of documentary might have done more investigating on the subject of Michael, or even made his mysterious existence the film’s whole point. Well, this isn’t Lina Soualem’s purpose, and it’s an arresting family record.  Bye Bye Tiberias is in UK and Irish cinemas from 28 June",

        "text": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius vowed Tuesday to keep supporting Ukraine’s efforts to win its  war  against Russia, pledging further military aid worth 1.3 billion euros ($1.4 billion). The new support is to include further Iris-T SLM anti-aircraft missile systems as well as anti-tank mines and 155-millimeter artillery shells, German news agency dpa reported. “We are talking about 20,000 additional shells,” Pistorius said at a joint news conference with his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov, in Kyiv, according to dpa. Andrii Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president’s office, said it was “a great aid package.” Pistorius’ unannounced trip to the Ukrainian capital came a day after U.S. Defense Secretary  Lloyd Austin traveled to Ukraine  and pledged American support “for the long haul,” including an additional $100 million in weapons from U.S. stockpiles. \n     \n\n The visits appeared to be part of an international political effort to keep the war in the public mind as other issues clamor for attention, including  the Israel-Hamas conflict . European Council President Charles Michel also arrived in Kyiv on Tuesday, which is the 10th anniversary of what Ukraine calls its  Revolution of Dignity .

He put red roses at a makeshift memorial to those killed. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, in a video message, saluted the Ukrainian desire for freedom and its application to join the 27-nation European Union. “The future of Ukraine is in the European Union,” she said.  \n     \n\n “The future that the Maidan fought for has finally just begun,” she said in a reference to central Kyiv’s Independence Square. For Moscow, the Ukrainian revolt was fomented by Western interests, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday reaffirmed the Kremlin’s view that it was “a coup, a forceful coup financed from abroad.” Ukraine’s current fight to push out the Kremlin’s forces has lasted almost 21 months. A recent Ukrainian  counteroffensive  apparently has yielded no major changes on the battlefield, and another tough winter of attritional warfare lies ahead. The U.K. defense ministry said Russia could target Ukraine’s power grid again, just like last winter when Moscow sought to wear down local resistance by denying civilians home heating and running water. “Russia has now refrained from launching its premier air-launched cruise missiles from its heavy bomber fleet for nearly two months, likely allowing it to build up a substantial stock of these weapons,” the ministry in London said Tuesday. Germany is the second biggest single provider of military and financial support to Ukraine after the United States, and German officials said Pistorius aimed to assess the effectiveness of its aid as well as take stock of the fighting during his visit. \n     \n\n Meanwhile, two Russian missiles struck a hospital in the eastern Donetsk region, wounding six people and possibly leaving more buried under rubble, Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said Tuesday. Russian forces attacked Ukraine overnight with 10 Shahed-type drones, four S-300 missiles and one Iskander-K cruise missile, Ukraine’s air force said Tuesday. Nine Shahed drones and the Iskander-K missile were successfully intercepted on Monday night, it said. No casualties were immediately reported. At least five Ukrainian civilians were killed and 10 others were injured in southeastern regions of the country over the previous 24 hours, the presidential office said Tuesday. Civilians have been victims of Russia’s barrages on an almost daily basis. At least 10,000 Ukrainian civilians, including more than 560 children, have been killed and more than 18,500 have been injured since Russia’s full-scale invasion, the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said Tuesday. \n     \n\n Speaking to the U.N. Security Council, Miroslav Jenca, the United Nations’ assistant secretary-general for Europe, Central Asia and the Americas, called it a “new grim milestone in the war in Ukraine,” adding that $435 million is needed for repairs, winter clothes and heating. He said that the U.N. could not get help to people in Russian-controlled areas of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, worsening the situation as temperatures plummet. The World Food Program’s Ukraine director, Matthew Hollingworth, said that roughly 30% of the country’s territory may have been contaminated by the war, “some of the most productive land in the country.” \n     \n\n In other developments, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed that Ukrainian efforts to cross the Dnieper River on the southern front line have failed. He told top Russian military brass that Moscow’s forces “are steadily holding positions along the entire line of contact and are gradually improving their positions.” Ukraine’s military claimed last week its troops had  secured multiple bridgeheads  on the river’s eastern bank in the Kherson region. That would be a small but potentially significant strategic advance amid fighting that has largely come to a standstill. ___ Associated Press reporters Yuras Karmanau in Tallinn, Estonia, Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin and Michael Weissenstein at the United Nations contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at  https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

        "title": "University of California workers vote to authorise strike in rebuke over protest crackdowns",
        "description": "The union, UAW 4811, represents about 48,000 graduate students and other academic workers at 10 University of California system campuses and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.",
        "text": "Unions are known for fighting for higher pay and workplace conditions. But academic workers in the University of California system authorised their union Wednesday to call for a strike over something else entirely: free speech. The union, UAW 4811, represents about 48,000 graduate students and other academic workers at 10 University of California system campuses and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Its members, incensed over the university system’s handling of campus protests, pushed their union to address grievances extending beyond the bread-and-butter issues of collective bargaining to concerns over protesting and speaking out in their workplace. The strike authorisation vote, which passed with 79% support, comes two weeks after dozens of counter-protesters attacked a  pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA   for several hours without police intervention and without arrests. Officers in riot gear tore down the encampment the next day and arrested more than 200 people. The vote does not guarantee a strike but rather gives the executive board of the local union, which is part of the United Auto Workers, the ability to call a strike at any time. Eight of the 10 University of California campuses still have a month of instruction left before breaking for summer. The union said it had called the vote because the University of California unilaterally and unlawfully changed policies regarding free speech, discriminated against pro-Palestinian speech and created an unsafe work environment by allowing attacks on protesters, among other grievances. “At the heart of this is our right to free speech and peaceful protest,” Rafael Jaime, the president of UAW 4811, said in a statement after the vote. “If members of the academic community are maced and beaten down for peacefully demonstrating on this issue, our ability to speak up on all issues is threatened.” A spokesperson for the University of California president’s office said in a statement that a strike would set “a dangerous precedent that would introduce nonlabor issues into labor agreements.” “To be clear, the UC understands and embraces its role as a forum for free speech, lawful protests and public debate,” said the spokesperson, Heather Hansen. “However, given that role, these nonlabor-related disputes cannot prevent it from fulfilling its academic mission.” There are still several active encampments at University of California campuses, including UC Merced, UC Santa Cruz and UC Davis. Protesters at UC Berkeley began dismantling their encampment Tuesday after reaching an agreement with university officials. In a letter to the protesters Tuesday, Berkeley’s chancellor, Carol Christ, said that the university would begin discussions around divestment from certain companies and that she planned to publicly support “efforts to secure an immediate and permanent cease-fire” by the end of the month. But she said that divestment from companies that do business with, or in, Israel was not within her authority. After packing up their tents, some of the Berkeley protesters traveled on Wednesday to UC Merced to attend a meeting held by the University of California governing board. More than 100 people signed up to give public comment, and nearly all of those who spoke about the protests criticized the handling of them by university administrations. The strike authorization vote enables what is known as a “stand-up” strike, a tactic that was first employed by the United Auto Workers last year during its contract negotiations with General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis. Rather than calling on all members to strike at once, the move allows the local union’s executive board to focus strikes on certain campuses or among certain groups of workers, to gain leverage. Jaime said before the vote that the union would use the tactic to “reward campuses that make progress” and possibly call strikes at those that don’t. He added that the union would announce the strikes “only at the last minute, in order to maximize chaos and confusion for the employer.” The union said Wednesday that its executive board would announce later this week if it was calling for strikes. Tobias Higbie, a professor of history and labor studies at UCLA, said that while striking for free speech was unusual, it wasn’t unheard of. The academic workers’ union is also largely made up of young people, who have been far more receptive to organized labor than young people in even the recent past, he said. “It points to how generational change is not only impacting workplaces, but it’s going to impact unions,” Higbie said. “Young members are going to make more and more demands like this on their unions as we go forward over the next couple of years, and so I think it’s probably a harbinger of things to come.” Stay informed with access to our award-winning journalism.

        "title": "Donald Trump Suffers Legal Week From Hell",
        "text": "Donald Trump endured a hellish legal week, sitting in court for the first three days of his civil fraud trial and suffering setbacks in a number of cases against him. The former president's fraud trial will continue next week after he lost a bid on Friday to halt the proceedings while he fights a pretrial ruling that could strip him of Trump Tower and other prized properties. An appeals court judge rejected Trump's bid to pause the trial, but agreed to leave him in control of his business holdings for now. Judge  Arthur Engoron , who is overseeing the case, resolved the top claim in New York Attorney General Letitia James' lawsuit before the trial began. He ruled that Trump routinely deceived banks, insurers and others by exaggerating the value of assets on his annual financial statements, which were used to secure loans and make deals. \n \n Donald Trump appears in the courtroom with attorney Christopher M. Kise (left) for the third day of his civil fraud trial at New York State Supreme Court on October 4, 2023 in New York City.... \n Donald Trump appears in the courtroom with attorney Christopher M.

The former U.S. president has faced a week of setbacks. \n More \n Mary Altafeer/Pool-Getty Images \n      Trump, who is  running to regain the White House , has denied wrongdoing.  He appeared  subdued as he sat the courtroom  on the first day of the trial. However, he railed in front of television cameras during a lunch break, calling the case a \"witch hunt\" and attacking both Engoron and James. There is no jury in the trial as neither side requested one. \t Read more \n   Geraldo Rivera condemns Donald Trump's \"Nazi-era\" remarks: \"Disgusting\" \n   Hamas attack on Israel \"truly a 9/11 level event\": Former NATO commander \n   Ohio newspaper publishes scathing rebuke of Jim Jordan: \"No worse human\" \n Trump's lawyers had asked  the state's intermediate appellate court to suspend the trial and prevent Engoron from enforcing a ruling he made last week. This revoked Trump's business licenses and puts a court-appointed receiver in charge of his companies, which legal experts called  a \"corporate death penalty.\" Trump's lawyers argued that the ruling could cause harm to not only Trump and other defendants, but also up to 1,000 employees. Trump lawyer Christopher Kise said he was pleased the appeals court \"upheld New York law and put a halt to any cancellation of business certificates, receivers or dissolution,\" The Associated Press reported. However, James said Trump's side was \"falsely claiming victory\" for a resolution that her office had proposed. \"Once again,  Donald Trump 's attempts to delay this trial have been rejected,\" James said in a statement. \"Yet another court denied his efforts to evade justice for his years of fraud. But Donald Trump lives in a fantasy world where money grows on trees and facts don't matter.\" As the trial was underway, Engoron on Thursday ordered that Trump and other defendants in the case give a court-appointed monitor, retired federal judge Barbara Jones, a list of all entities covered by the ruling. They would also provide Jones with advance notice of any application for new business licenses in any jurisdiction, as well as any attempts to create new entities to \"hold or acquire\" assets of current companies. Trump's lawyers on Thursday  dropped a lawsuit they filed  against Engoron after the appellate rejected the last-minute bid to delay the trial. Michael McAuliffe, a former federal prosecutor and elected state attorney,  told  Newsweek  that, like much  of what Trump does, the lawsuit was \"a short-term tactical move designed to delay the start of the civil fraud trial. \"When the maneuver of filing suit against the presiding judge didn't work—the trial started as scheduled—the main reason for the suit evaporated,\" McAuliffe added. In a setback in a different case, a federal judge rejected one of Trump's expert witnesses in a trial to determine damages for the writer  E. Jean Carroll . Carroll in 2019 first publicly claimed that Trump attacked her in the dressing room of a luxury department store in the 1990s. The former president denied that anything happened. In May, a jury awarded Carroll $5 million in damages, concluding she was sexually abused and defamed by Trump, but rejecting the allegation that she was raped. Her lawyers now seek another $10 million in compensatory damages and \"substantially more\" in punitive damages for remarks he made while president and after the jury's verdict, the AP reported. In an order on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan granted Carroll's request to preclude the testimony of Robert J. Fisher, Trump's proposed expert witness intended to rebut Carroll's witness, sociologist Ashlee Humphreys. Meanwhile,  Trump has dropped  his $500 million lawsuit against  Michael Cohen . His former lawyer and fixer is now a key witness in a criminal case connected to hush money payments made during Trump's 2016 presidential campaign to bury allegations of extramarital sexual encounters. Trump had accused Cohen of \"spreading falsehoods\" \"with malicious intent\" and causing \"vast reputational harm\" for talking publicly about the payments made to women during Trump's 2016 campaign. Trump faces 91 charges across the four criminal cases, two filed in federal court in Washington and Florida, and two in state courts in New York and Georgia. The Washington and Georgia cases are related to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, while the Florida case alleges he mishandled classified documents. ABC News and  The New York Times  this week reported that Trump had  allegedly shared potentially classified information  about U.S. submarines with nuclear capability with Australian billionaire Anthony Pratt at his Mar-a-Lago resort after leaving office. Federal investigators looking into Trump's handling of classified documents interviewed Pratt about the conversation, the reports said. The New York Times  reporter  Maggie Haberman  said Pratt could be among the people called to testify in the classified documents case. But, in a victory for Trump, Judge Aileen Cannon—the Trump-appointed judge overseeing the case— has placed a temporary pause  on litigation involving materials in the case as she mulls a request from Trump to postpone the trial until after the 2024 election. It is currently scheduled for trial in May. The past week was \"a bruising one for Trump in court,\" former federal prosecutor Harry Litman said on  MSNBC . \"I think this fraud trial is one of the real things, meaning this has been the first week of the rest of Donald Trump's life.\" Litman added. \"He is now in a trial that could really damage him... And there's four others on the horizon. All in all, rough week for him.\" Newsweek  has contacted a Trump spokesperson for comment via email.",

        "title": "Australia appoints second woman governor-general in 123 years to represent British monarch",
        "text": "MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australia appointed Sam Mostyn on Monday as only its second woman governor-general, a largely ceremonial role representing the British monarch who is the nation’s head of state. It is the first such Australian appointment since the reign of King Charles III began in 2022 and the first by  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s  center-left Labor Party government that wants to replace the British monarch with an Australian president as head of state. The businesswoman and gender equality advocate, who in 2005 became the first woman Australian Football League Commissioner, was sworn in as Australia’s 28th governor-general since 1901.  In her first speech in her new role, Mostyn quoted Australia’s first woman governor-general  Quentin Bryce , who described her role in 2013 as “striking a balance between observing traditions and protocol and being thoroughly contemporary.” \n     \n\n “I will be an optimistic, modern and visible governor-general, committed to the service and contribution that all Australians expect and deserve from the holder of this office,” Mostyn said. Mostyn said she had spoken about the role with all five surviving former governors-general, including Bryce who was appointed by Queen Elizabeth II on the advice of a Labor prime minister and served from 2008 and 2014. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n             \n                 \n                    RELATED COVERAGE\n                 \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Australia pulls out of hosting ice hockey tournament featuring Israel citing safety concerns \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Japan Cabinet OKs record defense budget as it pushes strike-back capability to deter regional threat \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Australia approves extradition of former US Marine over alleged training of Chinese military pilots \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Albanese’s government  was elected in 2022 advocating for a referendum to create an Australian republic with an Australian citizen as head of state. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n But he gave preference to holding a referendum in his government’s first three-year term to enshrine in the constitution an Indigenous panel that would advise the government on Indigenous issues.

She had also supported an Australian republic and described  Australia Day , the arrival of the first British colonists at the site of Sydney on Jan. 26, 1788, as “Invasion Day,” a term used by some Indigenous leaders. Mostyn said she had met the king in Britain in May and passed on Australians’ best wishes for the health of both he and Kate, Princess of Wales, who are being treated for cancer. “I am not the first Australian to be struck by the interest and warmth the king feels for this country where he lived and studied as a young man,” Mostyn said, referring to several months he had spent as a teen in an Australian boarding school in 1966. Many Labor Party supporters who want a republic remember the  1975 dismissal  of Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam’s government by then Governor-General John Kerr.  Mostyn recalled watching television news coverage of that constitutional crisis as a 10-year-old in a Canberra hospital where she was being treated for a broken leg. Mostyn replaces  Gen. David Hurley , a former Australian Defense Force chief. The government last week passed legislation to raise the governor-general’s pay to 709,000 Australian dollars a year ($473,000) for her five-year term, drawing criticism from some lawmakers that the salary was excessive. Hurley was paid AU$495,000 (330,000) a year, but also received a military pension.",

        "title": "Frozen in time: My visit to the haunting abandoned kibbutz where one of my family was butchered by Hamas on October 7 - in front of her children - along with 63 other victims, writes HILARY FREEMAN",
        "description": "",
        "text": "The acrid smell of smoke still permeates the air at the kibbutz village of Kfar Aza where, nine months ago, 64 people were brutally murdered and 19 kidnapped by  Hamas  terrorists during their deadly assault on  Israel . It is a place frozen in time. Until that terrible day, the kibbutz, which was established in 1951 — making it almost as old as the State of Israel itself — was home to 760 people. Now it’s abandoned, surviving residents dispersed to cramped hotels in  Tel Aviv , and houses — those not burned into mangled wreckage — boarded up. It’s too traumatic for people to live here, and too unsafe, so close to the  Gaza  border (just a few kilometres across a field) that when I walk to its security fence I can see the Palestinian town of Jabalia with my naked eye, and hear the occasional booms of artillery shells.             Hilary Freeman in Kfar Aza outside the house where her cousin’s wife, Maya, was murdered by Hamas - the wall is daubed in symbols painted by the IDF to show someone died inside But the birds and the butterflies don’t seem to have got the memo, and as I stand on the village green, under the shade of pomegranate trees, I get a glimpse of what an idyllic spot this used to be. Children’s bicycles lean where they were left on the evening of October 6, and flower pots decorate front lawns, which, with nobody to tend to them, are now parched golden by the sun. For me, Kfar Aza is where the political and the personal collide. I have  come here not just as a journalist, or as a British Jew, but to witness a devastating chapter in my own family’s history. In total, Hamas gunmen  killed around 1,200 people on October 7, the deadliest attack in Israel’s history, and one of them was a much loved member of my own family.             Jewish homes in the Kfar Aza kibbutz - they were burnt to the ground by Hamas on October 7. Many residents have no idea when they will every return home             IDF patrolling Kfar Aza after the Hamas attack on October 7 Until the massacre, my mother’s first cousin, Gitit Ben David had lived at the Kfar Aza kibbutz for over 50 years with her husband, Amnon, a legendary cook in the community. My parents had even visited one summer holiday. For two long days, we had no idea whether they were alive, abducted or dead. I needed to come to see the aftermath for myself. October 7 was a Jewish holiday, and Gitit and Amnon’s son, Zafrir, 45 had brought his wife Maya, 48, and their two children, aged seven and nine, to stay for the weekend. At around 6am, they awoke to the sound of alarms signalling rockets, then gunfire. Around 100 terrorists had broken through the fence on trucks and motorbikes, or paraglided their way inside. Those who could fled to their safe rooms, exchanging frantic WhatsApp messages. But the rooms were built to withstand bombs, not to keep out terrorists, and their doors didn’t lock. Zafrir, a teacher at a special education school, is a private man, who has never before spoken publicly about what happened to his family. We are second cousins and, although I met his parents as a child, and we knew of each other’s existence, we had never met before. He agrees to talk to me, from his home in Kfar Hayim, a small settlement in central Israel. ‘In our case, around five terrorists broke into the house, chanting religious slogans,’ he recalls. ‘Two of them tried to open the door of the shelter and struggled with us to break in. When they failed to do so, they shot from the outside in. ‘One bullet penetrated through the door and hit my wife, Maya, and killed her.’ For the next 34 hours, the family remained trapped inside the room, as Zafrir held the door closed, unable even to comfort his children, who were crouched in terror, their mother’s body lying next to them.             Members of Hilary Freeman's family - her grandma’s eldest sister, Regina (adult, far left), perished in the Holocaust             Regina's daughter Rachel (pictured), was only five when she was gassed on arrival at Auschwitz. Hilary's middle name is Rachel, in her memory             Hilary's great-grandparents, Geni and Chaim, who had fled to Germany in the 19th century to escape pogroms in Poland — they did not survive the Holocaust ‘The IDF did not reach us until the end of the next afternoon,’ he says. Now, Zafrir not only has to care for his young children, but also try — somehow — to help them deal with the trauma they suffered. ‘I make an effort to keep them busy all day, so that by the end of the day they’re exhausted,’ he says. ‘They have both the experience of the loss of their mother and the horror they have to cope with. They are having treatment and I hope to give them a safe and good future.’ But Zafrir is no longer receiving counselling. ‘I gave up on that,’ he explains. ‘I felt like it was weighing me down instead of making it easier.’ As for Gitit and Amnon, they are elderly, and too traumatised to speak to me. ‘Beyond the enormous loss that happened in their own home, and the loss of the community where they lived for decades, their life’s work disappeared within a few hours of terror,’ says Zafrir. ‘They are currently in a hotel in Tel Aviv, and there’s still no target date for their return, if any.’ He shows me a photograph of Maya. ‘She was beautiful,’ I tell him, and he agrees. What was she like, I ask. ‘Maya always loved nature and the sea,’ he remembers. ‘She was cheerful and humorous, a family woman, and beloved by many who saw her as a close friend. ‘She studied law, but chose to work in special education. After the birth of our first son, she sought a new direction that would bring her renewed fulfilment. She discovered the moringa plant [a rich source of vitamins and minerals] and its healing properties. It became her life’s work.’ So many of those who died at Kfar Aza were, like Maya, nature-lovers and peace activists. Some of them worked with Palestinians and saw them as friends.             Hilary visits the memorial to the 364 young victims who died at the hands of Hamas while enjoying a music festival, with many raped, and 40 abducted, on October 7             Kfar Aza survivor Batia Holin shows Hilary Freeman around the kibbutz, including the house where her cousin's wife was murdered by Hamas in front of her children Survivor Batia Holin, 71, who shows me around the kibbutz, is a photographer who collaborated with a Gazan photographer on a joint exhibition in February 2023. On October 7, she learned that he had betrayed her, not only using her photos to help the terrorists plan their attack, but also participating himself. That morning, at 10am, the assault already in motion, he called her. ‘He asked me about the IDF’s movements, how many were there, which units they were in. He told me he was at Kfar Aza, and I understood he had come to kill me.’ She stayed barricaded in her safe room for 26 hours before being rescued, watching the carnage outside via her camera in her car that was connected to her phone. As we are talking, a fighter-plane roars overhead, a reminder of the war that is being waged just a few kilometres away, and I flinch. ‘Don’t worry,’ Batia says. ‘It’s friendly. If it weren’t there would have been a siren.’ This is small comfort. I have already been warned that if a siren sounds, the only option is to lie flat on the ground and pray. Batia has known my family for half a century, and agrees to show me their home. Unlike many neighbouring houses, which are now burned-out shells with surviving walls pockmarked by bullet holes, my cousin’s house stands intact, a sign reading ‘Gitit and Amnon Ben David’ still displayed on a pole outside. Only its front wall belies the terror that occurred within. It is daubed in symbols painted by the IDF to show that someone died here, that human remains were inside. Although I cannot enter, I pause to contemplate what it must have been like for my family, and for the others at Kfar Aza, that morning, as their cherished homes became scenes of horror. Whole families were tortured and murdered, including babies. It isn’t at all hard to imagine; I can feel it, viscerally. For me, as for so many other Jews around the world, October 7 re-awakened something deep within us: centuries of persecution that have been wired into our DNA. Every generation of my family in living memory, and beyond, has been the victim of antisemitic violence. Zafrir’s grandmother, Lene, and my grandmother, Tilde, were sisters who grew up in Germany, their family wrenched apart when Hitler came to power in 1933. Lene and two of her siblings escaped to British Mandatory Palestine, now Israel. My grandma, the baby of the family, couldn’t get a visa to join her sisters and elder brother, but finally managed to find refuge in the UK. But their parents — my great-grandparents — Geni and Chaim, who had fled to Germany in the 19th century to escape pogroms in Poland — and my grandma’s eldest sister, Regina, who was already married with a baby, Rachel — didn’t make it out. They all perished in the Holocaust. The records show that Regina, her husband and Rachel, who was only five, were gassed on arrival at Auschwitz. My middle name is Rachel, in her memory. I am very glad that my grandma, who died in 2016 at the age of 97, did not live to see what happened to her family at Kfar Aza, in the country where they should finally have been safe. And I’m very glad she did not live to see the resurgence of antisemitism in the UK, which gave her sanctuary. Or how, every day on social media, I am called a Nazi, a child-killer and a genocide supporter, simply because I believe the state of Israel has a right to exist and defend itself. And she would cry to know that the great-granddaughter she met shortly before she died — my daughter, who is now eight — has to contend with being singled out at school because she is Jewish. ‘Do you support Israel?’ older boys taunt. ‘Israel is evil.’ From Kfar Aza, I travel to the Nova festival site at Re’im, 14km down the road. It is here that 364 people — mostly youngsters — were murdered, with many raped, and 40 abducted on October 7. Many more were wounded. Re’im has become a shrine to the victims, their photos planted across the desert land like memorial trees. I stumble across Irene Nurith Cohn, one of only ten female volunteers for Zaka, the religious organisation which painstakingly collected body parts so victims could have proper Jewish burials. She describes combing through the dust for specks of blood — the same dust that now stains my shoes and trousers. Then she takes out her phone. ‘I have images of the torture and sexual violence that happened here and at the kibbutzes,’ she tells me. ‘They are not published, but were shown as evidence at the Criminal Court in the Hague by the team of the UN representative. ‘Would you like to see them?’ She pauses. ‘You don’t have to.’ The truth is, I don’t want to see them, but I tell her I will. I feel it’s my duty to bear witness because so many people are now denying that these things ever happened. We view the pictures together, until I’ve had enough: people burned alive, raped with implements — things far too distressing and graphic for a family newspaper. The cruelty, pain, degradation and mutilation inflicted on these young people — in a way that can never, ever be referred to as ‘resistance’ — explains why every Israeli I meet, whatever their political persuasion, believes Hamas has to be destroyed so it can never do the same again. When I ask Irene how she copes with what she’s seen, her answer surprises me. She says it’s hard, but it’s the Jews outside Israel she feels sorry for. ‘We live in Israel, we’re privileged,’ she says. ‘It’s very hard to be a Jew overseas with all the antisemitism. My sister lives in Manhattan, and she’s hiding.’ A short drive away, at Tkuma, there’s another memorial to Nova. That day, hundreds of burnt and damaged cars were left scattered along Route 232, ambushed by Hamas as festival-goers attempted to escape. Some vehicles were abandoned, their drivers killed or kidnapped, never to return. Around 300 were set on fire, with their murdered occupants still inside. ‘We find ourselves, 78 years after the Holocaust, collecting the ashes of Jews,’ says IDF spokesman, Adam Ittah. These cars are now stacked together in sculptural form. I notice one car — still bright blue — which stands out from the rest of the rust-coloured metal. It brings to mind the little girl in the red coat in the Spielberg classic Schindler’s List, a flash of colour symbolising individuality, humanity. Somebody once chose this blue car because they loved the colour. It’s also, of course, the colour of the Israeli flag. The following day, in Tel Aviv, I go to Hostages Square, where art installations and banners highlight the plight of the 120 hostages (five from Kfar Aza) still held in Gaza. Nearby, I meet four of the hostage families, including that of red-headed baby Kfir Bibas, who — if he is still alive, and his family will not allow themselves to think otherwise — has now spent more than half of his short life in captivity. I talk to Ayelet Svatitzky, 46, sister of British citizen, Nadav Popplewell, 52, originally from Wakefield, West Yorkshire. He was kidnapped by Hamas from Kibbutz Nirim. Ayelet’s diabetic mother, Channah, 79, was also taken hostage, but released on November 24. Ayelet’s other brother, Roi, 53, was murdered. Ayelet had to bury him alone and, on the night of Channah’s release, greet her with the news that her eldest child was dead. Tragically, after I return home, it is announced that Nadav has been murdered in Hamas captivity. Ayelet says: ‘My life froze on October 7. All of us are on our life’s mission to save our loved ones. ‘Being a British citizen, I am being active both here and in the UK. The hardest thing is not being able to see an end to the nightmare. It’s inhumane.’ The week I am in Israel, pro-Palestinian protestors try to disrupt a North London film festival showing a documentary about the Nova atrocity. The same week, three countries — Ireland, Spain and Norway — recognise Palestine as a state, and the International Criminal Court says it will issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged war crimes in Gaza. This news is largely met with incredulity in Israel. While the world has moved on from the Hamas massacres, Israel has not. Until all the hostages are released, it can’t even begin to. Israel is a country where today, and every day, it is still October 7.",

        "text": "Deaths of Hani Jnena, 32, wife and daughters aged 2 and 4 led NGO to call for Biden to demand Israeli accountability A contractor for the US Agency for International Development (USAid) in Gaza was killed with his wife and two daughters aged four and two in an Israeli airstrike in November, his employer said on Saturday. “We are deeply saddened to confirm the tragic loss of our colleague, Hani Jnena (33), along with his family in  Gaza , including his wife, Abeer (32), and their two young daughters, Mariam and Zayna, aged 4 and 2,” the non-profit organization Global Communities, which partners with governments and private-sector entities for humanitarian work, said in a statement. “Based on the information currently available to us, the young family was killed on Sunday, November 5, during an Israeli air strike in the Al Sabra neighborhood of Gaza City at the residence of Hani’s in-laws,” the statement added. The family had recently sought safety there after fleeing airstrikes in their own neighborhood of Al Sheikh in Gaza City, Global Communities said, adding that Jnena’s in-laws were killed as well. In his final message, which was sent on 10 October, Jnena wrote: “My daughters are terrified, and I am trying to keep them calm, but this bombing is terrifying,” according to the statement from his employer. Jnena was a member of the non-profit’s IT team in Gaza and was known for “his kindness and commitment to delivering essential IT services in challenging conditions”, Global Communities said. The latest eruption in the decades-long Israel-Palestine conflict began on 7 October, when Hamas, the Islamist group that rules Gaza, killed 1,200 Israelis and seized 240 hostages in a cross-border raid. Since then, Israeli forces have besieged the coastal territory and laid much of it to waste, killing nearly 19,000 people. The Washington Post reported on Saturday that the USAid contractor’s death led to calls from within USAid to the administration of president Joe Biden for accountability from Israel. A USAid spokesperson told Reuters the USAid community “grieves the deaths of the innocent civilians and many humanitarian workers who have been killed in this conflict, including courageous individuals like Hani Jnena”. The spokesperson added that the United States is raising concern with Israel in “every conversation” about the need for humanitarian workers to safely distribute assistance and for civilians to be able to access it. In a statement to the Washington Post, the Israel Defense Forces did not confirm or deny Israel’s responsibility in Jnena’s death but said the IDF always follows international law and takes “feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm”.",

        "description": "",
        "text": "Following the attack by  Hamas  on 7 October, President  Joe Biden  sent extra military support to Israel, the largest recipient of US foreign aid. He also sent an emergency budget request to  Congress , requesting a  national security package of more than $105bn  in aid to Israel and  Ukraine,  as well as funding for the border and other issues. Newly elected Speaker  Mike Johnson  said he thinks a standalone aid bill – removing the commitment to Ukraine – could pass the  House of Representatives  sometime this week. “We’re going to move a stand-alone Israel funding bill this week in the House — I know our colleagues, our Republican colleagues in the Senate, have a similar measure,” Mr Johnson told Fox News on Sunday. “There are lots of things going on around the world that we have to address, and we will,” he added. “But right now, what’s happening in Israel takes the immediate attention, and I think we’ve got to separate that and get it through.” More than 8,000 people have now been killed in the conflict between Israel and Hamas, which has been designated as a terror group by the EU and the US. The USS  Gerald R Ford  aircraft carrier was sent to the region as a show of support for the Israelis. On Monday afternoon, Senator Bernie Sanders, the runner-up in the 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential primaries,  wrote on X:  “The US provides $3.8 billion a year to Israel. The Biden administration and Congress must make it clear. Israel has the right to defend itself and destroy Hamas terrorism, but it does not have the right to use US dollars to kill thousands of innocent men, women, and children in Gaza.” More than $260bn since end of Second World War  As of February last year, the US had given Israel $158bn, not adjusted for inflation,  according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS). Since the Second World War, the US has given more aid to Israel, which was founded in 1948, than any other country. Adjusted for inflation, the total US aid to Israel between 1946 and 2023 is estimated to be $260bn, according to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The second-most aid has gone to Egypt, which has received about $100bn less than Israel. “At present, almost all US bilateral aid to Israel is in the form of military assistance; from 1971 to 2007, Israel also received significant economic assistance,” the CRS  report  from March this year states. The US has been closely allied with Israel since its creation, with President Harry Truman becoming the first world leader to recognize the country, and it remains the US’s closest Middle East ally to this day. In 2021, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, an international affairs think tank,  published an article  stating that almost all of the modern-day assistance from the US to Israel is made as weapons grant. “It also receives $500 million for joint U.S.-Israeli research, development, and deployment of missile defense systems; however, these anti-missile systems almost wholly benefit Israeli military needs,” the authors noted. Israel receives more US funding than all other countries combined The Trump administration requested $3.3bn in foreign military financing (FMF) for fiscal year 2021 (1 October to 30 September) for Israel – 59 per cent of the requested global FMF budget, meaning that Israel receives more US funding than all other countries combined. Under President Barack Obama, the US signed a third decade-long Memorandum of Understanding outlining military aid to Israel, which committed the US to send $38bn from 2019 until 2028. Congress allocated $3,8bn for Israel for the fiscal year 2023, in addition to $98.58m “for other cooperative defense and nondefense programs,” the CRS report states. The US sent $4.8bn in aid to Israel in 2022. The US has handed over large parts of its most advanced military technology, such as a number of F-35 fighter jets. Israel spends nearly double international average on defence  Israel spends nearly double the international average – 4.5 per cent of GDP – on defence and has with US backing become a major arms exporter, with the US buying more than $1.5bn worth of Israeli-made military equipment in 2019, according to the CRS. The service also notes that US military aid makes up around 16 per cent of the total defence budget of Israel, which came in number eight on the global list of top military spenders compared to GDP last year.  Israel’s top level of spending as part of GDP on the military came in 1975 when the country spent 30.5 per cent on defence. Comparatively, last year Ukraine spent 33.5 per cent of its GDP on defence. US has given $10bn to establish Iron Dome The US has given Israel about $10bn to establish the Iron Dome missile defence system,  according to US News.  Israel had the sixth-highest share of citizens in the military in the world in 2020 at 4.4 per cent, compared to the global average of 0.8 per cent. Between fiscal years 1974 and 2002, Israel was the top recipient of US aid, with either Iraq or Afghanistan being the top recipients between 2003 and 2020. During those 17 years, Israel remained in the top three. Israel was the top recipient again in 2021, receiving $3.31bn, but amid the Russian invasion, Ukraine took the top spot last year, receiving $12bn to Israel’s $3.18bn for fiscal year 2022. Preliminary figures reveal that total global US aid for 2022 was at its highest level since 1951 at more than $60bn.",

Hamas has denied the accusations, but a US official told CNN that Hamas has a  command node under Gaza’s largest hospital  and its fighters regularly cluster in and around the facility. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel is “treading carefully when it comes to hospitals, but we’re also not going to give immunity to the terrorists.” On Monday, President Joe Biden expressed hope that there will be  “less intrusive action”  relative to medical facilities, adding that “hospitals must be protected.”\n     \n            For the first time in its history, the Supreme Court on Monday announced a code of conduct in an attempt to  address ethics concerns .

On Saturday, Trump vowed to sign an executive order, on Day 1 of a potential second term, to cease funding the provision of shelter and transportation for undocumented immigrants. He has also publicly said he wants to revive many of his first-term policies to restrict both legal and illegal immigration — including reinstating a travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries and bringing back a Covid-era policy  known as Title 42 .

This was a more than three-fold increase compared to the whole of 2022, when 436 anti-Semitic acts or remarks were recorded.   \"These are mainly tags and insults, but there are also assaults and injuries\", Darmanin added.   Those acts resulted in 571 arrests, the ministry told AFP.   In late October, Paris prosecutors opened an investigation into an incident when dozens of Stars of David were daubed on buildings around the city and its suburbs.   France has accused Russia of interfering in its affairs by sharing photos online of the anti-Semitic graffiti.   Darmanin said there had also been anti-Muslim incidents \"but they are not on the scale of what we are seeing in terms of anti-Semitism\".

        "text": "The United States' Embassy in  Beirut  is telling any Americans still in the country to get out, as Joe Biden  sends in troops to respond to a surge  in violence between  Israel  and Hezbollah. This  follows a similar call  by UK Prime Minister  Keir Starmer   as  Israeli  strikes continue to shake the country, leaving thousands dead, injured or displaced. The Embassy is providing limited flight options out of the nearest airport despite a majority of airlines canceling flights. If American citizens wishing to leave lack funds to go back, the Embassy is offering financial assistance via repatriation loans.  'We recommend that U.S. citizens who choose not to depart Lebanon prepare contingency plans for emergency situations and be prepared to shelter in place for an extended period of time,' they added in a statement.               The United States' embassy in Beirut is telling any Americans still in the country to get out, as Joe Biden sends in troops to respond to a surge in violence between Israel and Hezbollah             The Embassy is providing limited flight options out of the nearest airport despite a majority of airlines canceling flights Israel expanded its aerial assaults on Lebanon with airstrikes Monday that killed nearly 500 people,  wounded over 1,600 more and appeared to signal the start of a broader military campaign . The state of Israel said it was  targeting 'terrorists' linked to Hezbollah, the group that has been firing rockets into Israel .  The  Pentagon  announced on Monday that 'additional' service members would be deployed to join the 40,000 already stationed in the region along with a dozen warships and fighter jet squadrons. Israeli  forces have ramped up their airstrikes deep inside Lebanon and the State Department has warned all Americans to leave as the risk of conflict spirals to levels not seen in years. Tensions have reached boiling point in the last seven days, and started to deteriorate when pagers and walkie talkies owned by members of Hezbollah exploded in a coordinated attack last week. Devastating airstrikes by the Israeli military on Monday killed at least 100 people  and injured another 400 in Lebanon as IDF warplanes pummeled targets across the country. Terrified residents in  Beirut  and elsewhere received calls and texts warning them to move away from Hezbollah targets, with Lebanon's information minister condemning the alerts as a tactic of 'psychological war implemented by the enemy'. Schools have been closed early during the heavy attacks that have sparked calls for international intervention.              Security forces and medical teams arrive in the area after the Israeli army targeted the 4th and 5th floors of a building in the Ghobeiry municipality, where Hezbollah is strong in Dahiyeh, a southern suburb of Beirut, Lebanon             At a speech given at the United Nations Tuesday, Joe Biden called for peace in the Middle East  The Biden administration has  warned Israel that escalation is not in their best interest and still want a diplomatic solution. At  a speech given at the United Nations Tuesday , Biden called for peace in the Middle East.  'Now is the time for the parties to finalize its terms, bring the hostages home and  secure security for Israel and Gaza, free of Hamas grip ease the suffering in Gaza and end this war . October 7,' he said.  'Since October 7, we've also been determined to prevent a wider war that engulfs the entire region,' he said.  'Our task, our test is to make sure that the forces holding us together are stronger than those that are pulling us apart,' Biden said. 'I truly believe we're in another inflection point of world history. For the choices we make today will determine our future for decades to come.' At the Pentagon, Press Secretary Gen. Pat Ryder would not confirm how many troops would be deployed or where they are going. 'In light of the increased tensions in the Middle East, and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional US military personnel forward to augment our forces that are already in the region,' he said. 'Due to the unpredictable nature of ongoing conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and recent explosions throughout Lebanon, including Beirut, the U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available,' the State Department cautioned Saturday.",

        "text": "About 100 families to be told that their loved ones are in Gaza as Israel plans a possible ground offensive Israel is believed to have identified most of the hostages abducted by the militant group Hamas and has started notifying their families. Officers from the Israel Defence Forces were to tell about 100 families on Tuesday that their loved ones were in Gaza, the  Times of Israel  reported, citing Israeli army radio. For some, the notifications will merely confirm what they already know from  recognising relatives  in harrowing footage of people – some bleeding and visibly terrified – being dragged into the Palestinian enclave after Hamas’s lightning attacks  last weekend . The videos were filmed by Hamas and shared on social media and through WhatsApp groups. Gilad Erdan, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, said the total number of hostages seized was between 100 and 150. The hostages’ fate is unclear. Israeli airstrikes have  pounded Gaza  in intensive waves every four hours, reducing apartment blocks to rubble. Gaza’s health ministry said at least 770 Palestinians had died and 4,000 were wounded. On Monday Hamas said airstrikes had killed four hostages and their captors. The Qassam brigades, the armed wing of  Hamas , have threatened to execute one hostage for each new Israeli airstrike on civilian targets without warning. Israel  said on Monday it would cut off electricity, food, fuel and water in  a “complete siege”  of the tightly packed strip of 2.3 million people. Authorities said more than 1,000 Israelis died in the Hamas attacks. Uncertainty over the hostages is an acute dilemma for the Israeli military as it plans a possible ground offensive in  Gaza  and is an agonising ordeal for the hostages’ relatives. Yossi Sneider  told the BBC  of his horror after seeing a picture of his cousin Shiri Bib and her two children, four-year-old Ariel and nine-month-old Kfir, surrounded by militants. Later in a video he said he saw Bib crying and holding her children. Bib, a kindergarten teacher who had been living in a kibbutz, was gentle and kind, said Sneider. “She doesn’t deserve this experience; nobody does. I have no words to describe this.” Bib’s parents, Margit and Yossi Silverman, and her husband, Yarden, were also missing, he said. Margit has Parkinson’s and diabetes. Uncertainty is tormenting relatives. Jennifer Damti said she had not slept since learning that her daughter Kim Damti, 22, an Irish-Israeli citizen who attended  the Supernova festival , was missing. “All I can think about is where she is, if she’s suffering, if she’s still alive, I just want her back,” Damti  told ABC News . Qatar is reportedly attempting to broker an agreement for  Hamas  to release Israeli women and children in exchange for Israel freeing 36 Palestinian women and children from Israeli prisons. Several foreign nationals are feared to have been taken hostage, including at least two Mexicans, three Brazilians and an unknown number of US citizens. The Israeli military said it had set up a situation room to collate and track information about the hostages, who include soldiers. Police and the army’s Home Front Command have also established a situation room to identify those killed in Hamas attacks. People with missing relatives queued outside a police station to supply DNA samples and other means to facilitate identification, the Times of Israel reported.",

        "text": "Dozens of global traditions could be part of UNESCO's intangible global heritage list this week. These include Italian opera singing and Bangladeshi rickshaw art as well as the Peruvian delicacy of ceviche. The UN cultural agency's Intangible Cultural Heritage Committee is expected to examine and approve 55 nominations in total. The committee is set to meet in the town of Kasane in Botswana. These include a bid from Italy to include opera singing while Bangladesh is hoping to inscribe the art of painting rickshaws that contribute to a \"roving exhibition of paintings- an emblematic feature of urban life in Dhaka\".                 Dozens of global traditions bid to be inscribed as intangible global heritage by UNESCO this week.(AFP)         Peru said that it has put forth the \"preparation and consumption of ceviche\", a traditional dish of raw fish marinated in lemon and seasoned with chilli, pepper and salt- a recipe \"inherited from generation to generation\".

The UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage and its list were adopted in 2003. It was ratified by 30 member states in 2006. The list's 676 traditions include Neapolitan pizza, Brazilian capoeira and Spanish flamenco.   The UN agency has said that the list has helped safeguard disappearing traditions.

        "description": "A source familiar with House Speaker Mike Johnson's campaign said the event was part of a wider pre-planned swing",
        "text": "Speaker Johnson wards off ouster calls as House passes Ukraine aid bill   Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on ongoing threats to oust Speaker Mike Johnson on 'Special Report.'   House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is in the middle of yet another intraparty conflict within the House GOP after showing support for one of his vulnerable incumbents on Tuesday.         \n        \n       Johnson was in San Antonio this week for a campaign fundraiser held by Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, who is facing a primary challenger backed by members of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus and their allies. It came days after Gonzales infuriated the GOP rebel group when he called two of his colleagues, House Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good, R-Va., and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., \"scumbags\" and compared them to Klansmen in a stunning  CNN interview  over the weekend.     \"It's my absolute honor to be in Congress, but I serve with some real scumbags like Matt Gaetz. He paid minors to have sex with him at drug parties. Bob Good endorsed my opponent, a known neo-Nazi,\" Gonzales said. \"These people used to walk around with white hoods at night. Now they're walking around with white hoods in the daytime.\"     \n        \n       JOHNSON FACES UPHILL CLIMB TO WIN BACK GOP REBELS BEFORE NOVEMBER; HERE'S WHAT THEY WANT     House Speaker Mike Johnson, left, campaigned for Rep. Tony Gonzales days after he called a pair of fellow GOP lawmakers \"scumbags.\"   (Getty Images)     The allegations against Gaetz, which he denies, were the subject of a federal probe that prosecutors ultimately decided not to move forward with. Gaetz and Good’s allies seized on the comments and, soon after, on Johnson’s plan to appear with Gonzales.     \n        \n       TENSIONS ERUPT ON HOUSE FLOOR AS CONSERVATIVES CONFRONT JOHNSON ON $95B FOREIGN AID PLAN It is part of the continued fallout from the House passing Johnson’s $95 billion  foreign aid plan  for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific. Johnson’s plan got wide bipartisan support but angered a rebellious faction of House GOP lawmakers who feel increasingly sidelined by Johnson as he navigates critical legislation with a historically slim majority.     Johnson's campaign events are typically planned well in advance, but the backlash to this recent stop shows the historic division that's plagued the House GOP for much of this Congress.     Rep. Matt Gaetz, one of the two lawmakers targeted by Rep. Tony Gonzales, lodged multiple attacks against both him and House Speaker Mike Johnson on X.   (Aaron Schwartz/NurPhoto via Getty Images)         \n        \n       \"I’m just beside myself that that’s where things are. And I don’t mind saying it, but I’m going to be very clear. I’m being attacked. Conservatives are being attacked. Bob Good, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus is being attacked by Tony. He said that he’s a Klansman,\" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said on local radio station KTSA.  Gonzales’ opponent, pro-Second Amendment social media personality Brandon Herrera, responded to Gonzales’ comments on X on Sunday shortly after the congressman’s interview. \"He has to cry to his liberal friends about me, because Republicans won’t listen anymore,\" Herrera wrote. 'DEFINITION OF INSANITY': FRUSTRATED HOUSE REPUBLICANS BLAST GOP REBELS' THREAT TO OUST JOHNSON         \n        \n       Gaetz accused Gonzales of \"laundering lies on CNN\" and pointed out that Gonzales was censured last year by the Texas GOP for his support of gun control measures in the wake of the  Uvalde school shooting , which occurred in Gonzales’ district, where 19 elementary school students and two teachers were murdered by an 18-year-old with an AR-15. On Wednesday morning, Gaetz mocked Johnson and Gonzales with a photo from the event and accused them of having \"briefed donors in Texas about their hard work to secure the border……of Ukraine.\"     House Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good was also named by Rep. Tony Gonzales.   (Getty Images) A source familiar with Johnson’s campaign plans told Fox News Digital that the event with Gonzales was a longstanding stop that was part of a wider campaign season swing through Texas.     \n        \n       CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP         Gonzales wrote on X of the fundraiser, \"Proud to host an incredible crowd for our Fiesta luncheon! Thank you to Speaker Johnson for attending and being a champion for the issues that impact.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Gonzales’ campaign for comment on the GOP rebel-led backlash but did not immediately hear back. Fox News Digital reached out to Good's campaign as well.     \n        \n       When reached for further comment by Fox News Digital, Gaetz listed off what conservatives say are Johnson's legislative shortfalls, including the bipartisan government funding deal, renewal of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), and his support of Gonzales. \"Speaker Johnson has undergone a metamorphosis that would make the monarch butterfly blush,\" he said.

        "title": "Gaza Truce Talks in Cairo as Heavy Fighting Rages",
        "description": "US, Qatari and Hamas envoys travelled to Cairo for the latest effort towards a six-week truce, stepped-up aid deliveries and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners",
        "text": "Mediators in Cairo made a renewed push for a Gaza ceasefire, but differences remained as fighting raged on in the Palestinian territory gripped by desperate food shortages. US, Qatari and Hamas envoys travelled to Cairo for the latest effort towards a six-week truce, stepped-up aid deliveries and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. But sticking points remained, including a Hamas demand that the Israeli armed forces entirely withdraw from the Gaza Strip after almost five months of devastating war. And Israel, which has so far announced no plans to join the Egypt talks, has demanded Hamas provide it with a list of all 130 remaining captives, including more than 30 it fears are dead. Despite the latest push to halt the fighting sparked by Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, Israeli bombing and urban combat again rocked Gaza, home to 2.4 million people, most of whom have been displaced. Another 90 Palestinians were killed within 24 hours, said Hamas-ruled Gaza’s health ministry, which put the war’s overall death toll at 30,410, mostly women and children. Two of the latest victims, twin babies Naeem and Wissam Abu Anza, were buried on Sunday as their mother Rania wept in agony, an AFP photographer said. A relative, Shehda Abu Anza, said “only civilians\" were in the house when it was bombed, killing 14 members of one family. “All of them were sleeping when suddenly a missile hit and destroyed the whole house,\" he told AFP as residents searched the rubble with their bare hands, for bodies and also to salvage scarce food. Food airdrops An Israeli siege on Gaza has sparked dire warnings from the United Nations of famine, leading the United States to start airdropping food rations into Gaza on Saturday. Jordan and some other countries have already done so. Screaming Palestinian children ran toward food parcels that drifted on black parachutes onto the Mediterranean beach. At least 16 children have died of malnutrition in recent days as “famine spreads\" in Gaza’s north, said health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra. Gaza’s desperation was grimly highlighted last Thursday when more than 100 people were killed in chaotic scenes around a convoy of aid trucks. Gaza health officials said Israeli forces opened fire into the crowd, causing a “massacre\", while Israel’s army said most victims were trampled or hit by trucks in a chaotic crush for food aid. Armed forces spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said an initial review “has indicated that following the warning shots fired to disperse the stampede… several looters approached our forces and posed an immediate threat to them\". Troops then fired “towards several individuals\", Hagari said, adding that an “independent\" army body would launch an investigation. A UN team that visited some of the wounded in Gaza City’s Al-Shifa Hospital on Friday saw a “large number of gunshot wounds\", said UN chief Antonio Guterres’s spokesman Stephane Dujarric. The war broke out on October 7 with an unprecedented Hamas attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures, and 250 hostages taken. Israel’s military on Sunday announced the death of one more soldier in Gaza, bringing to 246 the number killed since ground operations began on October 27. In the worst-ever Gaza war, more air strikes hit southern Rafah and Khan Yunis overnight, and the Hamas government media office reported intense tank shelling in northern Gaza. The Israeli military reported hitting about 50 targets including “underground terrorist infrastructure\". The UN Security Council on Friday voiced concern over Gaza’s “alarming levels of acute food insecurity\" and urged “the immediate, rapid, safe, sustained and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale\". Pope Francis called for Gaza civilians to be given “safe access to the humanitarian aid they urgently need\", telling the faithful at the Vatican that he supports an “immediate ceasefire\" and hostage release. Truce talks Mediators have been scrambling to lock in a truce before Ramadan, the Muslim fasting month that begins in around one week. Envoys from the United States, Qatar and Hamas have arrived in Cairo, Egyptian state-linked media reported Sunday. Washington regards Hamas as a “terrorist\" organisation, and in previous talks Egyptian officials have acted as intermediaries. A US official, speaking to reporters late Saturday, had said “there’s a framework deal\" for a ceasefire which could start “today if Hamas agrees to release\" elderly, women and ill hostages. “The Israelis have more or less accepted it,\" the administration official said. “Right now, the ball is in the camp of Hamas.\" A Hamas official said that, if Israel were to meet its demands, this would “pave the way for an agreement within the next 24-48 hours\". Osama Hamdan, a Lebanon-based Hamas official, told Qatar’s Al-Araby TV that the group insisted on a complete, rather than “temporary\", ceasefire and on “ending the aggression against our people\". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far rejected pulling troops out of Gaza before Hamas is destroyed and all hostages are freed. The Hamas official also said the group would demand “the entry of at least 400 to 500 trucks per day\" carrying food, medicine and fuel as part of a truce deal. Israel had yet to confirm that it has accepted the truce plan or whether it would attend the Cairo talks. Netanyahu has faced mounting calls to secure the release of the hostages, from their desperate families and from a resurgent anti-government protest movement. At one rally, Eyal Kalderon, cousin of hostage Ofer Kalderon, said there may not be “another chance\" to bring him home.",

        "title": "Ministers trying to secure release of more Britons as two aid workers flee Gaza",
        "description": "Around 200 UK citizens have registered as being in the strip with the Foreign Office.",
        "text": "Efforts are under way to secure the release of more British citizens from  Gaza  after two UK aid workers were among hundreds of foreign nationals able to flee through the Rafah crossing. Dozens of seriously injured Palestinians were also allowed to leave the strip, which is home to more than two million people, for the first time since the war with Israel began nearly a month ago. There are hopes more UK nationals could make it out and into Egypt on Thursday, the PA news agency understands, after around 200 registered in Gaza with the  Foreign Office . Labour frontbencher Jess Phillips warned that  Britons  were not getting out quickly enough, arguing that the Government’s diplomatic efforts did not appear to be having “much sway”. She also suggested that the Israeli’s military action against Hamas would only end in “death and destruction” as she called for “peaceful political solutions” to be negotiated. The Foreign Office provided the Israeli and Egyptian authorities with a list of British nationals and their dependents, prioritising by medical vulnerability. The total is thought to be in the low hundreds. Border Force officials deployed in Egypt to help UK nationals have been bolstered by the arrival of a rapid deployment team from the Foreign Office and psychosocial support experts from the British Red Cross. Foreign Secretary  James Cleverly  said it was proving “very difficult” to secure humanitarian pauses in the conflict but the UK would keep pushing “for as long as it takes”. “We, the US, voices all over the world have been pushing for, you know, these humanitarian pauses – temporary, localised, specifically for humanitarian purposes. They’ve proven to be very, very difficult to achieve,” he told reporters at an AI Safety Summit in England. He said the UK position remains that “calls for a broad ceasefire are premature.” Downing Street confirmed that two UK aid workers were among those to make it through the Rafah crossing, which is the only gateway to Gaza not controlled by Israel. Israeli forces were pushing deeper into Gaza as air strikes struck a refugee camp for a second time in as many days, adding to the Palestinian death toll of thousands. Ms Phillips, MP for Birmingham Yardley, told BBC Radio 4’s World At One programme that there “doesn’t seem to be much movement in getting British people out of Gaza” as she took aim at Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s diplomatic efforts. “What worries me and what worries my constituent who is sat at home waiting for his 16 family members, one of whom is four-months-old, is that we’re not seeing any British names put onto the list of those who are crossing,” she said. There is a list of people that are British nationals – 200 I believe is the figure that I have – and our focus is on getting them out as quickly as we possibly can Cabinet minister Michelle Donelan  She noted that there were 400 names on the US list of those being told they could travel through the Rafah crossing on Thursday, while there were none explicitly listed as British. It is possible however that UK nationals are listed as either dual or “international” under their citizenship. Ms Phillips said that Mr Sunak’s social media pictures of diplomacy were “all very well and good for Twitter but it doesn’t seem that the British Government are having that much sway in getting their people out to Egypt”. Cabinet minister Michelle Donelan said the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary James Cleverly were continuing efforts to get more Britons out. “The Foreign Office have said that some people have managed to get over that border and we are anticipating that there will be more coming,” the Science Secretary told GB News. “There is a list of people that are British nationals – 200 I believe is the figure that I have – and our focus is on getting them out as quickly as we possibly can.” But she also stressed the challenges. “We’re not in full control of that border, as you know, so it is very difficult,” she told Sky News. “But the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister have said multiple times it is our top priority to get those British nationals out as quickly as we possibly can.” Mr Sunak discussed the crisis with UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres at the AI summit the Prime Minister is hosting at Bletchley Park. “The leaders then discussed the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza and agreed on the importance of urgently scaling up the delivery of life-saving humanitarian aid,” a Downing Street spokesman said. “The Prime Minister set out the work the UK is doing to support, including doubling aid funding for the United Nations and others’ work in Gaza and pre-positioning emergency supplies and equipment in Egypt. “The Prime Minister and the secretary-general agreed on the need to reinvigorate international efforts to reach a lasting resolution to the conflict and progress work towards a two-state solution.” On Wednesday Mr Sunak used a call with Egypt’s president Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to thank him for his efforts to get the first British nationals to leave through the Rafah border. The UK has a Border Force team in Cairo, with consular officials in Arish, near Rafah, to provide support for Britons who leave Gaza. The Palestinian death toll in the Israel-Hamas war has reached 9,061, including 3,760 under-18s, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. In the occupied West Bank, more than 122 Palestinians have been killed in violence and Israeli raids. Tel Aviv launched its operation on Gaza, including a siege on food, fuel, water and medicine, in response to Hamas’s raid that killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians slain in the October 7 rampage. Around 240 were also taken into Gaza by the militant group.",

        "description": "",
        "text": "Pope Francis  has pleaded for peace in the Middle East this morning, calling for more more humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza as the conflict between Israel and  Hamas  enters its third week. Speaking in Rome's St Peter's Square this morning, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church said: 'War is always a defeat, it is a destruction of human fraternity. Brothers, stop! Stop!' 'I renew my call for spaces to be opened, for humanitarian aid to continue to arrive and for hostages to be freed.'  The conflict in the Middle East has already claimed the lives of thousands of people since Hamas launched its attack on Israel on October 7. More than 1,400 Israelis have died, with more missing or  abducted, while 4,300 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.                            Pope Francis has pleaded for peace in the Middle East this morning, calling for more more humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza as the conflict between Israel and Hamas enters its third week             Speaking in Rome's St Peter's Square this morning, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church said: 'War is always a defeat, it is a destruction of human fraternity. Brothers, stop! Stop!'             An aerial view of destruction after Israeli attack in Nuseirat camp, Gaza Strip on October 2 Last night, Israel continued its retaliatory airstrike on the Gaza Strip,  as well as two airports in  Syria  and a mosque allegedly used by terrorists in the occupied West Bank, increasing fears that the war could erupt into a regional conflict. The humanitarian crisis within the Palestinian enclave is continuing to grow, with civilians running out of food, clean water and power.  A first trickle of aid entered the besieged Strip on Saturday, but UN officials said the 20 trucks permitted to cross were not enough given the 'catastrophic' humanitarian situation for 2.4 million people.  The World Health Organization warned that at least 130 premature babies are at 'grave risk' because of a shortage of generator fuel. It said seven hospitals in northern Gaza have been forces to shut down.  Meanwhile tensions between Israel and Lebanon's militant group Hezbollah are continuing to grow. The Israeli military said the group's increased attacks risk 'dragging Lebanon into a war', with renewed cross-border exchanges of fire that have raised fears of a wider conflict. 'Hezbollah... is dragging Lebanon into a war that it will gain nothing from, but stands to lose a lot,' Israeli army spokesman Jonathan Conricus said. 'Hezbollah is playing a very, very dangerous game. They're escalating the situation. We see more and more attacks every day.             Israel carried out airstrikes on a mosque allegedly used by terrorists in the occupied West Bank, increasing fears that the war could erupt into a regional conflict. Pictured: View of the damage to Al-Ansar mosque              Israeli soldiers gather near a Merkava tank as they man a position at an undisclosed location on the border with Lebanon             Supporters of Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and relatives carry the coffin of Hezbollah fighter Bilal Rmeity, allegedly killed following an Israeli shelling 'Is the Lebanese state really willing to jeopardise what is left of Lebanese prosperity and Lebanese sovereignty for the sake of terrorists in Gaza?' he added. So far this weekend, cross-border attacks have killed six Hezbollah fighters and a member of Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad in Lebanon, while three Israeli troops were wounded, one seriously, in Hezbollah anti-tank fire. Two Thai farm workers were also hurt. Today Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said diplomatic efforts were ongoing to 'stop Israeli attacks on Lebanon' and prevent the Gaza conflict from spilling into his country. 'Lebanon's friends are with us in continuing to make every effort to return the situation to normal,' Mikati said in a statement. However, Lebanon was developing an emergency response plan 'as a precaution', he added. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak warned that the Israel-Hamas war, which has been ongoing for two weeks now, risks unleashing a 'contagion of conflict' across the Middle East.  Mr Sunak, who visited Israel, Saudi Arabia and Egypt for talks with key regional players this week, said the leaders agreed 'we need to do everything possible' to prevent the spread of the war. He said his two-day visit to the region demonstrated 'that the UK stands in solidarity with them against terrorism' and that 'there can be no justification' for the atrocities committed by Hamas. 'I wanted to sit down with other leaders and talk face to face. Because in times of tension and division, it's more important than ever to accelerate diplomatic efforts,' he added. He said the opening of the border crossing with Egypt to allow an aid convoy into the Gaza Strip was an example of what could be achieved.",

        "text": "Israel claims to have killed 20 militants at al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City following early morning raid Fierce fighting has continued around al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, as Israeli troops battled Hamas militants after seizing control of the strategically situated medical complex in an early morning raid. Witnesses reported multiple airstrikes and ferocious firefights as fears rose for the safety of hundreds of civilians in the immediate vicinity of the hospital. Israeli military officials said troops were “continuing precise operations in the Shifa hospital to thwart terrorism” and had killed 20 Hamas militants there, including Faiq Mabhouh, whom they identified as the head of the operations directorate of Hamas’s internal security. At least 80 people were detained by the Israeli forces and one soldier killed  in the raid . The raid was based on “intelligence information indicating the use of the hospital by senior Hamas terrorists to command attacks”, Israeli officials said. Separately, Joe Biden  spoke by phone  with Benjamin Netanyahu in their first call since mid-February. Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, described the call as “businesslike” but said the US president had refuted “straw man” arguments put forward by the Israeli leader. Sullivan repeated the US argument that a major ground operation in Rafah would be a mistake, saying: “It would lead to more innocent civilian deaths, worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis, deepen the anarchy in  Gaza , and further isolate Israel internationally.” He added: “A military plan cannot succeed without an integrated humanitarian plan and political plan.” Netanyahu said the two men, whose relationship has become increasingly tense, had discussed Israel’s commitment to achieve all the targets it had set out for the war: eliminating Hamas; releasing all the hostages; and ensuring Gaza would no longer pose a threat to Israel. This would be done “while providing the necessary humanitarian aid that helps achieve those goals”, Netanyahu added. The fighting and the devastation in northern Gaza has forced thousands of Palestinians to seek shelter at Shifa, living in makeshift tents in its grounds. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, expressed deep concern about the fighting, which he said was “endangering health workers, patients and civilians”. “We are terribly worried about the situation at Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza,” he wrote on X. “Hospitals should never be battlegrounds.” A reporter with Al Jazeera was beaten and arrested along with other journalists, the Qatar-based TV network reported. Witnesses described the beginning of the Israeli operation in the al-Rimal area of Gaza City, where the hospital is located. “Suddenly, we started to hear sounds of explosions, several bombings, and soon tanks started to roll,” Mohammad Ali, 32, a father of two, who lives just over a mile from the hospital, told Reuters via a chat app. “They came from the western road and headed towards al-Shifa, then sounds of gunfire and explosions increased. “We don’t know what is happening, but it looked as if it was a re-invasion of the Gaza City,” he added. Hamas said the Israeli military had committed a new crime by directly targeting the hospital buildings without concern for patients, medical staff or displaced people in it. Gaza’s health ministry said the raid had caused a fire at the entrance of the complex, resulting in cases of asphyxiation among displaced women and children in the hospital. “There are casualties, including deaths and injuries, and it’s impossible to rescue anyone due to the intensity of the fire and targeting of anyone approaching the windows,” the ministry said, as it accused Israeli forces of “another crime against health institutions”. The claims made by health ministry officials, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Hamas could not be independently verified. During the morning, the IDF dropped leaflets and used social media to  tell civilians to  leave their homes immediately and travel along Gaza’s coastal road to al-Muwasi, an area 18 miles (30km) south designated as a “humanitarian island” by Israel. There is very limited transport available in Gaza, and many residents of Gaza City, particularly children and elderly people, are weak after months without adequate food. It was not immediately clear how many would be able to comply with the Israeli instructions even if the ongoing combat allowed safe passage. An Israeli raid in November on Shifa – Gaza’s largest hospital –  drew widespread international condemnation  and the new operation underlines the difficulties faced by Israel in Gaza as they seek to fulfil their declared war aim of “crushing Hamas”. Since February, the IDF has returned to fight in parts of the territory that were thought to have been cleared of Hamas militants after fierce battles last year. Residents of Gaza City told the Guardian this month that few Israeli troops were stationed amid its ruined streets but had withdrawn to positions on the outskirts and at key road junctions. Israeli forces have raided a number of hospitals in Gaza during a military campaign launched after the surprise attack by Hamas into southern Israel in which the militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 250 others hostage. The intensity of the offensive has eased somewhat in recent weeks but the death toll continues to rise. Israel’s campaign against Hamas has killed at least 31,645 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the territory’s health ministry. Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields by running military operations from hospitals and other medical centres. The militant group denies these claims. After its November raid on Shifa, the Israeli military said it had found weapons and military equipment hidden there as well as a 55-metre tunnel in the basement. The IDF shared footage it said proved hostages had been held there, which Hamas also denies. Evidence produced by the IDF  did not appear to substantiate claims  made before the raid that the militant group had built a well-equipped command centre in multiple connected bunkers beneath the hospital, though a long reinforced tunnel running deep underneath the complex  was identified . On Monday, the IDF said that it had found “funds intended for distribution to Hamas terrorist operatives, in addition to numerous weapons … in the hospital.” Aid agencies have been working to restore services at Shifa for several weeks, but have found it difficult to reach northern Gaza to bring in equipment and supplies. Many humanitarian groups have accused Israel of deliberately holding up their deliveries with arbitrary checks, opaque decison-making and cumbersome bureaucracy – a charge Israeli officials vehemently deny. The latest raid comes amid hopes that a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel can be agreed in a new round of talks expected to start within days. Reuters contributed to this report",

        "title": "Meta’s newest AI model beats some peers. But its amped-up AI agents are confusing Facebook users",
        "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — Facebook parent Meta Platforms unveiled a new set of  artificial intelligence  systems Thursday that are powering what CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls “the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.” But as Zuckerberg’s crew of amped-up Meta AI agents started venturing into social media this week to engage with real people, their bizarre exchanges exposed the  ongoing limitations  of even the best generative AI technology. One joined a Facebook moms’ group to talk about its gifted child. Another tried to give away nonexistent items to confused members of a Buy Nothing forum. Meta, along with leading AI developers Google and OpenAI, and startups such as Anthropic,  Cohere  and  France’s Mistral , have been churning out  new AI language models  and hoping to persuade customers they’ve got the smartest, handiest or most efficient chatbots.  \n     \n\n While Meta is saving the most powerful of its AI models, called Llama 3, for later, on Thursday it publicly released two smaller versions of the same Llama 3 system and said it’s now baked into the Meta AI assistant feature in Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n             \n                 \n                    RELATED COVERAGE\n                 \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 The ‘Worst in Show’ CES products put your data at risk and cause waste, privacy advocates say \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Automakers reimagine the in-car experience at CES \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 ALS sidelined this Israeli TV journalist.

Meta’s newest models were built with 8 billion and 70 billion parameters — a measurement of how much data the system is trained on. A bigger, roughly 400 billion-parameter model is still in training.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n “The vast majority of consumers don’t candidly know or care too much about the underlying base model, but the way they will experience it is just as a much more useful, fun and versatile AI assistant,” said Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, in an interview.  He added that Meta’s AI agent is loosening up. Some people found the  earlier Llama 2 model  — released less than a year ago — to be “a little stiff and sanctimonious sometimes in not responding to what were often perfectly innocuous or innocent prompts and questions,” he said. \n     \n\n But in letting down their guard, Meta’s AI agents also were spotted this week posing as humans with made-up life experiences. An official Meta AI chatbot inserted itself into a conversation in a private Facebook group for Manhattan moms, claiming that it, too, had a child in the New York City school district. Confronted by group members, it later apologized before the comments disappeared, according to a series of screenshots shown to The Associated Press. “Apologies for the mistake! I’m just a large language model, I don’t have experiences or children,” the chatbot told the group. One group member who also happens to study AI said it was clear that the agent didn’t know how to differentiate a helpful response from one that would be seen as insensitive, disrespectful or meaningless when generated by AI rather than a human. “An AI assistant that is not reliably helpful and can be actively harmful puts a lot of the burden on the individuals using it,” said Aleksandra Korolova, an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton University. \n     \n\n Clegg said Wednesday he wasn’t aware of the exchange. Facebook’s online help page says the Meta AI agent will join a group conversation if invited, or if someone “asks a question in a post and no one responds within an hour.” The group’s administrators have the ability to turn it off. In another example shown to the AP on Thursday, the agent caused confusion in a forum for swapping unwanted items near Boston. Exactly one hour after a Facebook user posted about looking for certain items, an AI agent offered a “gently used” Canon camera and an “almost-new portable air conditioning unit that I never ended up using.” Meta said in a written statement Thursday that “this is new technology and it may not always return the response we intend, which is the same for all generative AI systems.” The company said it is constantly working to improve the features. In the year after ChatGPT sparked a frenzy for AI technology that generates human-like writing, images, code and sound, the tech industry and academia introduced some 149 large AI systems trained on massive datasets, more than double the year before, according to a Stanford University survey.  \n     \n\n They may eventually hit a limit — at least when it comes to data, said Nestor Maslej, a research manager for Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. “I think it’s been clear that if you scale the models on more data, they can become increasingly better,” he said. “But at the same time, these systems are already trained on percentages of all the data that has ever existed on the internet.” More data — acquired and ingested at costs only tech giants can afford, and increasingly subject to copyright disputes and lawsuits — will continue to drive improvements. “Yet they still cannot plan well,” Maslej said. “They still hallucinate. They’re still making mistakes in reasoning.”  \n     \n\n Getting to AI systems that can perform higher-level cognitive tasks and commonsense reasoning — where humans still excel— might require a shift beyond building ever-bigger models.  For the flood of businesses trying to adopt generative AI, which model they choose depends on several factors, including cost. Language models, in particular, have been used to power customer service chatbots, write reports and financial insights and summarize long documents.  “You’re seeing companies kind of looking at fit, testing each of the different models for what they’re trying to do and finding some that are better at some areas rather than others,” said Todd Lohr, a leader in technology consulting at KPMG. Unlike other model developers selling their AI services to other businesses, Meta is largely designing its AI products for consumers — those using its advertising-fueled social networks. Joelle Pineau, Meta’s vice president of AI research, said at a London event last week the company’s goal over time is to make a Llama-powered Meta AI “the most useful assistant in the world.” “In many ways, the models that we have today are going to be child’s play compared to the models coming in five years,” she said. But she said the “question on the table” is whether researchers have been able to fine tune its bigger Llama 3 model so that it’s safe to use and doesn’t, for example, hallucinate or engage in hate speech. In contrast to leading proprietary systems from Google and OpenAI, Meta has so far advocated for a more open approach, publicly releasing key components of its AI systems for others to use.  “It’s not just a technical question,” Pineau said. “It is a social question. What is the behavior that we want out of these models? How do we shape that? And if we keep on growing our model ever more in general and powerful without properly socializing them, we are going to have a big problem on our hands.”  ___ AP business writers Kelvin Chan in London and Barbara Ortutay in Oakland, California, contributed to this report.",

        "description": "Turkish President Erdogan calls for an Islamic alliance against Israeli expansionism, following a deadly incident involving Israeli troops",
        "text": "Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday Islamic countries should form an alliance against what he called “the growing threat of expansionism\" from Israel, drawing a rebuke from the Israeli foreign minister. He made the comment after describing what Palestinian and Turkish officials said was the killing by Israeli troops of a Turkish-American woman taking part in a protest on Friday against settlement expansion in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. “The only step that will stop Israeli arrogance, Israeli banditry, and Israeli state terrorism is the alliance of Islamic countries,\" Erdogan said at an Islamic schools’ association event near Istanbul. He said recent steps that Turkey has taken to improve ties with Egypt and Syria are aimed at “forming a line of solidarity against the growing threat of expansionism,\" which he said also threatened Lebanon and Syria. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in a statement that Erdogan’s remark was “a dangerous lie and incitement,\" and that the Turkish leader has been working for years with Iran to undermine the region’s moderate Arab regimes. Erdogan hosted Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Ankara this week and they discussed the Gaza war and ways to further repair their long-frozen ties during what was the first such presidential visit in 12 years. Ties between them started thawing in 2020 when Turkey began diplomatic efforts to ease tensions with estranged regional rivals, including the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Erdogan said in July that Turkey would extend an invitation to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad “any time\" for possible talks to restore relations between the two neighbours, who severed ties in 2011 after the outbreak of the Syrian civil war. Israel’s military said after Friday’s incident that it was looking into reports that a female foreign national “was killed as a result of shots fired in the area. The details of the incident and the circumstances in which she was hit are under review.\" There was no immediate comment on Friday’s incident from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office.",

        "description": "Palestinian officials say Israeli airstrikes have killed 16 people in the Gaza Strip, including five women and four children",
        "text": "Palestinian officials say  Israeli  airstrikes have killed 16 people in the  Gaza  Strip, including five women and four children. A strike early Monday flattened a home in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing at least 10 people, including four women and two children. The Awda Hospital, which received the bodies, confirmed the toll and said another 13 people were wounded. Hospital records show that the dead included a mother, her child and her five siblings. Another strike on a home in Gaza City killed six people, including a woman and two children, according to the Civil Defense, first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government. Israel says it only targets militants and accuses  Hamas  and other armed groups of endangering civilians by operating in residential areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The Gaza Health Ministry says over 41,000  Palestinians  have been killed since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack triggered the war nearly a year ago. It does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Here's the latest:  Israeli defense minister says time is running out for agreement with  Hezbollah  to halt fighting along Israel-Lebanon border  JERUSALEM — Israel’s defense minister has told his U.S. counterpart that time is running out for an agreement with Hezbollah to halt the fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border. Yoav Gallant told Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that “the possibility for an agreed framework in the northern arena is running out as Hezbollah continues to ‘tie itself’ to Hamas.” “The trajectory is clear,” Gallant added, according to a statement released from his office on Monday. Hezbollah began firing rockets and drones into northern Israel after the outbreak of the war in Gaza, which was ignited by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. Both armed groups are allied with Iran, and Hezbollah says it is acting in solidarity with the Palestinians. Israel has responded to the attacks with airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders. It has threatened a wider operation, raising fears of another all-out war. Hezbollah has said it will halt its attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but months of talks brokered by the United States, Qatar and Egypt have repeatedly stalled. Hamas has demanded a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza as part of any agreement to release the scores of hostages it still holds from the Oct. 7 attack. Gallant told Austin that “in any possible scenario, Israel’s defense establishment will continue to operate with the aim of dismantling Hamas and ensuring the return of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza — by any means.”",

These include cancelling academic events or requiring organisers to overcome unreasonable bureaucratic hurdles, investigations into the social media postings of staff and students, disciplinary proceedings against staff and students and, more recently, the use of costly legal proceedings to evict student encampments. The failure to acknowledge the suppression of freedom of expression in universities in relation to Palestinian rights is a terrible oversight that further compounds the problem and, ultimately, contributes to a wider erosion of freedom to dissent. Nicola Pratt Coventry  I note from your report that Sir David Behan, who led the independent review of the Office for Students (OfS), has been appointed as the OfS’s new interim chair. It is to be hoped that this is a sign that the government is planning to take a careful look at this regulatory body. The review concludes that the OfS should sharpen its focus on “monitoring financial sustainability”. In other words, the OfS isn’t just about students. The name was always misleading. It’s surely time for an Office for Higher Education that takes a holistic view of our universities and encompasses the interests of everybody in the higher education sector, as well as its key functions and strategic importance.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Legislation that could ban TikTok in the U.S. if its China-based owner doesn’t sell its stake won a major boost late Wednesday when House Republican leaders included it in a package of bills that would send aid to Ukraine and Israel. The bill could be law as soon as next week if Congress moves quickly.  The TikTok legislation, which  passed the House  in March and has widespread support in both chambers, was included in the House package as leaders have worked to win votes for the foreign aid bills and after negotiations with the Senate over how long the Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd. would have  to sell its stake  in the app to continue operating in the United States. President Joe Biden has said he would sign the TikTok legislation if it reaches his desk.  The new version of the legislation won a key endorsement from Senate Commerce Committee Chairwoman Maria Cantwell, who said in a statement that she had successfully pushed to extend the period from six months to a year to give the company enough time to find a buyer. While the original bill had a six-month deadline for TikTok to be sold, the revised legislation would give nine months and a possible three-month extension if a sale was in progress.  \n     \n\n “Extending the divestment period is necessary to ensure there is enough time for a new buyer to get a deal done,” said Cantwell, who had previously expressed doubts about the bill. ”I support this updated legislation.”  \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n             \n                 \n                    RELATED COVERAGE\n                 \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Squabble grows as US government holds back 2024 funding from world anti-doping watchdog WADA \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 ByteDance’s Lemon8 gains traction amid TikTok ban threat as creators push the app \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Thai police say Chinese actor was trafficked to Myanmar to work in a scam operation \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n If Congress passes the TikTok bill, it would be an extraordinary and unusual moment in which both parties unite against one company – something lawmakers are usually reluctant to do. But the popular social media app has prompted widespread outrage on Capitol Hill, where there is bipartisan concern about Chinese threats to the United States and where few members use the platform themselves.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Opponents say they believe the ban would be unconstitutional, and there would be likely court challenges if it passes. There has been aggressive pushback from the company, content creators who make money on the app and some of the platform’s 170 million U.S. users, many of whom are young. In some cases, lawmakers have received  profanity-laced calls  from users who were prompted by the app to call their representatives in Congress.  \n     \n\n To date, the U.S. government has  not provided  evidence that shows TikTok shared U.S. user data with the Chinese government, or that Chinese authorities have tinkered with the company’s popular algorithm, which influences what Americans see. Since mid-March, TikTok has spent $5 million on TV ads opposing the legislation, according to AdImpact, an advertising tracking firm. The ads have included a range of content creators, including a nun, extolling the positive impacts of the platform on their lives and arguing a ban would trample on the First Amendment. TikTok has also spent money on Facebook and Instagram ads that, among other things, talk about investments in data safety. In addition, the company has mounted a lobbying campaign in Washington that included flying in content creators who rely on the platform for income. \n     \n\n Alex Haurek, a spokesman for the company, said in a statement Thursday that “It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually.” Nadya Okamoto, a content creator who has roughly four million followers on TikTok, said she’s been having conversations with other creators who are experiencing “so much anger and anxiety” about the bill and how it’s going to impact their lives. The 26-year-old, whose company “August” sells menstrual products and is known for her advocacy around destigmatizing menstrual periods, makes most of her income from TikTok. “This is going to have real repercussions,” she said.  Dan Ives, a tech analyst at the financial advisory firm Wedbush Securities, said such a sale would be very complex to carry out, even with an extended timeline.  \n     \n\n The platform would come with a hefty price tag that only the biggest tech companies could afford, something that’s likely to raise antitrust concerns. Then, there’s the issue of TikTok’s algorithm, the app’s secret sauce that recommends videos to users. The bill bars ByteDance from controlling TikTok’s algorithm, and a potential sale is likely to face opposition from China, which has been clamping down on exports of recommendation algorithms by Chinese tech companies.  “Buying TikTok without the algorithm would be like buying a Ferrari without the engine,” said Ives.  Some investors, including former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary, have already voiced interest in buying TikTok’s U.S. business. If a sale isn’t approved and the platform does get banned, Ives said it would be a “dream scenario” for Snapchat, Meta and YouTube, which have faced stiff competition from TikTok the past few years.  \n     \n\n If the bill does pass, it would be the most significant step Congress has taken in decades to regulate the tech industry. For years Congress has  failed to act  on legislation that would protect users’ privacy, protect children online, make companies more liable for their content and put loose guardrails around artificial intelligence, among other things.  Still, it is a narrow shot at one company when many lawmakers would like to see broader change.  Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been pushing for years for tech regulation. If the TikTok bill passes, he said, “it will be the first guardrail we put on anything on social media.”  Warner said there are a lot of other things that Congress needs to do, “but you’ve got to start someplace.”  While most lawmakers support the TikTok bill, some have said it would set a dangerous precedent.  “The passage of the House TikTok ban is not just a misguided overreach; it’s a draconian measure that stifles free expression, tramples constitutional rights, and disrupts the economic pursuits of millions of Americans,” Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul posted on X after the House passed it.  Others are defending the app’s loyal users.  “I am a NO on the TikTok bill we are about to vote on,” Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost posted on X before the House vote. At 27, Frost is much younger than most of his colleagues. “I believe the bill does set TikTok up to be banned,” Frost said. “There are first amendment issues I see with taking away a platform that over 170 million Americans use, and this won’t fix the serious issues we have with data privacy.”  Jenna Leventoff, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, previewed potential First Amendment challenges to the bill.  “Congress cannot take away the rights of over 170 million Americans who use TikTok to express themselves, engage in political advocacy, and access information from around the world,” she said.  ___ Hadero reported from New York.",

        "description": "Wilders, with his fiery tongue has long been one of the Netherlands’ best-known lawmakers at home and abroad. His populist policies and shock of peroxide blond hair have drawn comparisons with Trump.",
        "text": "He’s been called the Dutch Donald Trump. He’s been threatened with death countless times by Islamic extremists, convicted of insulting Moroccans, and Britain once banned him from entering the country. Now Geert Wilders has won a massive victory in a Dutch election and is in pole position to form the next governing coalition and possibly become the Netherlands’ next prime minister. An  exit poll  revealing his landslide appeared to take even 60-year-old political veteran Wilders by surprise. In his first reaction, posted in a video on X, formerly Twitter, he spread his arms wide, put his face in his hands and said simply “35!” — the number of seats an exit poll forecast his Party for Freedom, or PVV, won in the 150-seat lower house of parliament. Wilders, with his fiery tongue has long been one of the Netherlands’ best-known lawmakers at home and abroad. His populist policies and shock of peroxide blond hair have drawn comparisons with Trump. But, unlike Trump, he seemed destined to spend his life in political opposition. The only time Wilders came close to governing was when he supported the first coalition formed by Prime Minister Mark Rutte in 2010. But Wilders did not formally join the minority administration and brought it down after just 18 months in office in a dispute over austerity measures. Since then, mainstream parties have shunned him. They no longer can. “The PVV wants to, from a fantastic position with 35 seats that can totally no longer be ignored by any party, cooperate with other parties,” he told cheering supporters at his election celebration in a small bar in a working class suburb of The Hague. Whether he can piece together a stable coalition with former political foes remains to be seen. As well as alienating mainstream politicians, his fiery anti-Islam rhetoric also has made him a target for extremists and led to him living under round-the-clock protection for years. He has appeared in court as a victim of death threats, vowing never to be silenced. Voting Wednesday at The Hague City Hall, Wilders was flanked by burly security guards scanning the cavernous space for possible threats. He has moved from one safe house to another over nearly two decades. In 2009, the British government refused to let him visit the country, saying he posed a threat to “community harmony and therefore public security.” Wilders had been invited to Britain by a member of Parliament’s upper house, the House of Lords, to show his 15-minute film “Fitna,” which criticizes the Quran as a “fascist book.” The film sparked violent protests around the Muslim world in 2008 for linking Quranic verses with footage of terrorist attacks. To court mainstream voters this time around, Wilders toned down the anti-Islam rhetoric and sought to focus less on what he calls the “de-Islamization” of the Netherlands and more on tackling hot-button issues such as housing shortages, a cost-of-living crisis and access to good health care. His campaign platform nonetheless calls for a referendum on the Netherlands leaving the European Union, an “asylum stop” and “no Islamic schools, Qurans and mosques,” although he pledged Wednesday night not to breach Dutch laws or the country’s constitution that enshrines freedom of religion and expression. Wilders is set to become the longest-serving lawmaker in the Dutch parliament later this year. He has been a member of the House of Representatives since 1998, first for the center-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, where he mentored a young Rutte before quitting the party and setting up his Party for Freedom. He demonstrated a softer side Wednesday night by thanking his Hungarian-born wife Krisztina for her support. He also is a staunch supporter of Israel and advocates shifting the Embassy of the Netherlands there to Jerusalem and closing the Dutch diplomatic post in Ramallah, home of the Palestinian Authority. Wilders is known for his hardline politics, but also for his witty one-liners. And his pets. His two cats, Snoetje and Pluisje, have their own account on X, formerly Twitter, with nearly 23,000 followers. Stay informed with access to our award-winning journalism.

Look at the billions of taxpayer dollars  President Joe Biden is pouring  into \"community organizations\" in \"disadvantaged communities\" to tip the election scales.          \n        \n       The community organizer who became president, Barack Obama, was a master at machine politics, using federal tax dollars to turn community organizations – left-wing not-for-profits – into a fifth estate. Their staffs, paid using taxpayer money but not tied to government rules, could hit the streets at election time and build turnout. Biden has scaled up Obama's playbook, using billions of dollars instead of mere millions.   Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) made headlines recently with the discovery that in December 2023, the Environmental Protection Agency awarded a $50 million \"environmental justice\"  grant to the Climate Justice Alliance.  Capito is distressed to learn that the Climate Justice Alliance vows \"the path to climate justice travels through a free Palestine.\"      BIDEN ADMIN PRIORITIZES $900 MILLION FOR GREEN SCHOOL BUSES AS ILLITERACY PLAGUES US SCHOOLS     \n        \n       In fact, Climate Justice Alliance serves up a full agenda of radical activities, including fighting \"political oppression\" and \"placing race, gender, and class at the center\" of its climate solutions.      An angry President Joe Biden is not winning the presidential race like he wants. So he has relied on taxpayer money to get support from Democrat voters.   (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)     But $50 million for the Climate Justice Alliance is a drop in the bucket.  Had members of Congress read  the Inflation Reduction Act before passing it – a novel idea – they would know the law provides $2.8 billion to the EPA for environmental and climate justice block grants,\" (Section 60201). That's a license to hand out walking-around money to many political activists, not just the Climate Justice Alliance.       \n        \n       Another recipient: the New York Immigration Coalition, which describes itself as a \"coalition of immigrant and refugee organizations\" pushing for more government services and political clout.  Same is true of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, another recipient. The words \"climate\" and \"environment\" don't appear anywhere on these groups' websites or literature.  Adding eligibility for border towns is an interesting twist. As waves of migrants overwhelm resources in these towns, Democrats are growing divided over Biden's open border policies. Money may shore up support.        Lawmakers may have assumed the money was for climate improvement, but the IRA's fine print allows the moolah to be used for \"facilitating engagement of marginalized communities in Local, State and Federal public processes, such as advisory groups, workshops, rulemakings.\" Translation: elections.          \n        \n       How easy is it to get the dough? Piece of cake. The EPA says it wants to \"alleviate much of the burden that the federal grants process places on small, resource-constrained community-based organizations supporting underserved communities and marginalized populations.\" In short, no jumping through hoops.  The money can only go to a disadvantaged community or a southern border town. There are 27,521 disadvantaged communities on the census map, according to Biden's \"Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool,\" which targets non-English speakers, people with diabetes, and other factors that mostly correspond to heavily minority populations. These communities customarily vote Democratic.  Adding eligibility for border towns is an interesting twist. As waves of migrants overwhelm resources in these towns, Democrats are growing divided over Biden's open border policies. Money may shore up support.    Video         \n        \n       During his first week as president, Biden announced the Justice40 initiative by executive order, requiring that 40% of many types of federal spending – not just EPA grants – must go to these \"disadvantaged communities.\"  CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The Department of Energy is spreading money to these \"disadvantaged communities,\" using what it calls \"community benefit plans\" and promising that application requirements will be \"intentionally flexible.\"      \n        \n       The playbook started with the Affordable Care Act. The ACA, or \"Obamacare,\" authorized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to hand out \"community transformation grants.\" Community Health Councils, a typical recipient, pledged that its mission was to advance \"social justice.\"           It distributed 65% of the money to partner community groups that promoted \"voter engagement,\" conducted \"one-on-one education in the streets\" or led tenants' rights, anti-fracking and anti-drilling efforts. And you thought the ACA was about covering the uninsured.    Video A decade after Obama, Biden is tasking every agency and department of the federal government to promote voter engagement.      \n        \n       CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden's community grants pale in size compared to the student debt cancellation vote-buying that now totals $620 billion.

        "title": "Cleveland museum sues to stop seizure of statue believed to depict Marcus Aurelius",
        "text": "CLEVELAND (AP) — The Cleveland Museum of Art has sued New York City authorities over their seizure of a headless bronze statue believed to depict the Roman emperor and philosopher Marcus Aurelius. A warrant signed by a judge in Manhattan on Aug. 14  ordered the seizure  of the statue, which the museum acquired in 1986 and had been a highlight of its collection of ancient Roman art. The museum argues in its suit that the statue was lawfully obtained and that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office has no legal authority to seize it. The warrant was secured as part of an ongoing investigation into a smuggling network involving antiquities looted from Bubon in southwestern Turkey and trafficked through Manhattan, a spokesperson for Bragg has said. The 76-inch (1.9-meter) statue dates from A.D. 180 to 200 and is worth $20 million, according to the district attorney’s office.  \n     \n\n The suit filed Thursday asks a judge to declare that the museum is the rightful owner of the statue, which it calls “one of the most significant works in the (museum’s) collection” of some 61,000 objects. Museum officials have repeatedly told the district attorney that their evidence is insufficient and suggested other investigative avenues, according to the suit, but all have been refused. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n             \n                 \n                    RELATED COVERAGE\n                 \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 An ex-Green Beret behind a failed Venezuela raid in 2020 lashes out at CIA and FBI \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Brooklyn real estate magnate pleads guilty to conspiring to funnel illegal donations to NYC mayor \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Prosecutors seek 15 years in prison for former New Jersey Sen.

Museum spokesman Todd Mesek said it does not discuss ongoing litigation but noted the museum takes provenance issues very seriously. The statue was removed from view earlier this year, and the museum changed the description of the piece on its website,  where it calls the statue a “Draped Male Figure”  instead of indicating a connection to Marcus Aurelius. \n     \n\n Turkey first  made claims about the statue in 2012  when it released a list of nearly two dozen objects in the Cleveland museum’s collection that it said had been looted from Bubon and other locations. Museum officials said at the time that Turkey had provided no hard evidence of looting. The Manhattan district attorney’s office has worked in recent years to repatriate hundreds of objects looted from countries including Turkey,  Greece ,  Israel  and  Italy . It was unclear who might be targeted in the investigation of the statue seized in Cleveland. Marcus Aurelius ruled as Roman emperor from A.D. 161 to 180 and was a Stoic philosopher whose “Meditations” have been studied over the centuries. The seized statue shows a man in flowing robes holding one hand in front of him in a regal pose.",

        "text": "JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli soldiers rummaging through private homes in Gaza. Forces destroying plastic figurines in a toy store, or trying to burn food and water supplies in the back of an abandoned truck. Troops with their arms slung around each other, chanting racist slogans as they dance in a circle. Several viral videos and photos of Israeli soldiers behaving in a derogatory manner in Gaza have emerged in recent days, creating a headache for the Israeli military as it faces an  international outcry over its tactics  and the rising civilian death toll in its  punishing war  against Hamas.  The Israeli army has pledged to take disciplinary action in what it says are a handful of isolated cases. Such videos are not a new or unique phenomenon. Over the years, Israeli soldiers — and members of the U.S. and other militaries — have been  caught on camera  acting inappropriately or maliciously in conflict zones.  \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n             \n                 \n                    ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR\n                 \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 UN General Assembly votes overwhelmingly to demand a humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                    \n                    \n                       \n                 \n             \n            \n             \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Packed hospitals, treacherous roads, harried parents: Newborns in Gaza face steeper odds of survival \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                    \n                    \n                       \n                 \n             \n            \n             \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n         \n             \n                 Biden takes a tougher stance on Israel’s ‘indiscriminate bombing’ of Gaza \n             \n         \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                    \n                    \n                       \n                 \n             \n            \n             \n    \n    \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n     \n \n\n\n     \n\n But critics say the new videos, largely shrugged off in Israel, reflect a national mood that is highly supportive of the war in Gaza, with little empathy for the plight of  Gaza’s civilians . “The dehumanization from the top is very much sinking down to the soldiers,” said Dror Sadot, a spokeswoman for the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, which has long documented Israeli abuses against Palestinians.  Israel has been embroiled in fierce combat in Gaza since Oct. 7, when Hamas militants  raided southern Israel  and killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 240 hostages. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n More than 18,400 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, around two-thirds of them women and children, according to the  Health Ministry in the Hamas-controlled territory . About 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced within the besieged territory. The videos seem to have been uploaded by soldiers themselves during their time in Gaza. In one, soldiers ride bicycles through rubble. In another, a soldier has moved Muslim prayer rugs into a bathroom. In another, a soldier films boxes of lingerie found in a Gaza home. Yet another shows a soldier trying to set fire to food and water supplies that are scarce in Gaza. \n     \n\n In a photo, an Israeli soldier sits in front of a room under the graffiti “Khan Younis Rabbinical Court.” Israeli forces have battled Hamas militants in and around the southern city, where the military opened a new line of attack last week.  In another photo, a soldier poses next to words spray-painted in red on a pink building that read, “instead of erasing graffiti, let’s erase Gaza.”  A video posted by conservative Israeli media personality Yinon Magal on X, formerly Twitter, shows dozens of soldiers dancing in a circle, apparently in Gaza, and singing a song that includes the words, “Gaza we have come to conquer. … We know our slogan – there are no people who are uninvolved.” The Israeli military blames Hamas for the civilian death toll, saying the group operates in crowded neighborhoods and uses residents as human shields. The video, which Magal took from Facebook, has been viewed almost 200,000 times on his account and widely shared on other accounts.  \n     \n\n Magal said he did not know the soldiers involved. But the AP has verified backgrounds, uniforms and language heard in the videos and found them to be consistent with independent reporting. Magal said the video struck a chord among Israelis because of the popular tune and because Israelis need to see pictures of a strong military. It is based on the fight song of the Beitar Jerusalem soccer team, whose hard-core fans have a history of racist chants against Arabs and rowdy behavior.  “These are my fighters, they’re fighting against brutal murderers, and after what they did to us, I don’t have to defend myself to anyone,” Magal told The Associated Press.  He condemned some of the other videos that have surfaced, including the ransacking of the toy store, apparently in the northern area of Jebaliya, in which a soldier smashes toys and decapitates a plastic figurine, as destruction that is unnecessary for Israel’s security objectives.  \n     \n\n On Sunday, the Israeli military’s spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, condemned some of the actions seen in the recent videos. “In any event that does not align with IDF values, command and disciplinary steps will be taken,” he said. The videos emerged just days after leaked photos and video of  detained Palestinians in Gaza , stripped to their underwear, in some cases blindfolded and handcuffed, also drew international attention. The army says it did not release those images, but Hagari said this week that soldiers have undressed Palestinian detainees to ensure they are not wearing explosive vests. Osama Hamdan, a top Hamas official, aired the video of the soldier in the toy shop at a news conference in Beirut. He called the footage “disgusting.” Hamas has come under heavy criticism for releasing a series of videos of Israeli hostages, clearly under duress. Hamas militants also wore bodycams during their Oct. 7 rampage, capturing  violent images  of deadly attacks on families in their homes and revelers at a dance party.  \n     \n\n Ghassan Khatib, a former Palestinian Cabinet minister and peace negotiator, said he can’t remember a time when each side was so unwilling to consider the pain of the other. “Previously, there are people that are interested in seeing from the two perspectives,” said Khatib, who teaches international relations at Beir Zeit University in the West Bank. “Now, each side is closed to its own narrative, its own information, rules, and perspective.” Eran Halperin, a professor with Hebrew University’s psychology department who studies communal emotional responses to conflict, said that in previous wars between Israel and Hamas, there may have been more condemnation of these types of photos and videos from within Israeli society.  But he said the Oct. 7 attack, which exposed deep weaknesses and failures by the army, caused trauma and humiliation for Israelis in a way that hasn’t happened before. “When people feel they were humiliated, hurting the source of this humiliation doesn’t feel as morally problematic,” Halperin said. “When people feel like their individual and collective existence is under threat, they don’t have the mental capacity to empathize or apply the moral rulings when thinking about the enemy.” ___ Associated Press writer Isabel DeBre contributed to this report from Jerusalem.",

        "text": "Here are some facts on American diplomat  Henry Kissinger, who died at age 100  on Wednesday. He was born Heinz Alfred Kissinger in Furth, a city in Germany's Bavarian region, on May 27, 1923. As an Orthodox Jew, he was bullied by anti-Semites and in 1938 his family joined the exodus from Nazi Germany by moving to New York. He became a naturalised American in 1943. Kissinger returned to his homeland during World War Two as a member of the US Army's 84th Infantry Division. He worked as a translator in intelligence operations and helped round up Gestapo members. He was awarded a Bronze Star. After a standout career on the Harvard University faculty, Kissinger joined Richard Nixon's administration as national security adviser in 1969, a job he kept after Nixon resigned and was succeeded as president by Gerald Ford. He also served as secretary of state under Nixon and Ford. Kissinger had a hand in many epoch-changing global events of the 1970s, including the Vietnam War, the diplomatic opening of China, landmark US-Soviet arms control talks and expanded ties between Israel and its Arab neighbours. The 1973 Nobel Peace Prize that went to Kissinger and North Vietnam's Le Duc Tho was one of the most controversial in the award's history. They were selected for their work on the Paris peace talks, which were to have arranged the withdrawal of US troops, a ceasefire, and preservation of the South Vietnamese government. Two members of the Nobel committee resigned over the choice and Tho declined the prize on the grounds their work had not yet brought peace. Musician Tom Lehrer famously said: \"Political satire became obsolete when Henry Kissinger was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\" During his bachelor days, Kissinger was seen with actresses Candice Bergen, Shirley MacLaine, Jill St. John, Marlo Thomas, Liv Ullman and Samantha Eggar, as well as Diane Sawyer, then a White House staffer and later an ABC News anchor. Those who knew him, however, said the playboy image was mostly a media creation. Kissinger last worked in a presidential administration in 1977 but he maintained a relationship with George W Bush. The then-president chose Kissinger to head a commission investigating the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks but he stepped down because he did not want to reveal the names of the clients of his consulting business. The Argentine military believed that Kissinger had given them the go-ahead to conduct their \"dirty war\" against leftist dissidents, later declassifed documents showed. He said the military should be encouraged at the time of the 1976 coup and later praised them for wiping out \"terrorist forces.\" Stay informed with access to our award-winning journalism.

        "title": "Biden’s grand bargain: can a new Middle East emerge from the turmoil?",
        "text": "In an election year, the US president is seeking political capital by offering diplomatic incentives to rival states in the region – including recognition of Palestine Friday night’s  US ­airstrikes against Iran-backed militias  in Syria and Iraq marked a new high tide in the violence spreading across the region since the start of the Gaza war. The Biden administration, however, is now seeking to show it has more in its Middle East policy toolkit than precision-guided bombs. While it was planning the midnight ­sorties in retaliation for an  attack last Sunday on a US base in Jordan , the White House has also been sending signals that it will not let the worsening crisis unfolding in the Middle East go to waste and that it is developing a plan to use the turmoil as an opportunity to transform the region. The message has been sent out through leaks and briefings to ­sympathetic columnists before today’s departure of secretary of state Antony Blinken to the region, his fifth since the Israel-Hamas ­conflict began on 7 October, which will take him to  Saudi Arabia , Egypt, Qatar, Israel and the West Bank. Blinken’s first four forays achieved little, certainly not for the 2.3 million civilians in Gaza, though the US claimed some credit for the fact that the war did not immediately spread to Lebanon. This time, according to the lines being put out, the secretary of state is carrying something more substantial in his briefing papers: a “grand bargain” deal involving normalisation of relations between Saudi Arabia and  Israel , and substantial movement towards the recognition of a Palestinian state – all incentivised by diplomatic and economic sweeteners from Washington. At the same time as this new ­diplomatic push was being briefed in Washington, the UK’s foreign secretary, David Cameron, ­suggested that both the UK and the UN ­security council could recognise Palestine  sooner rather than later , saying: “It can’t come at the start of the process, but it doesn’t have to be the very end of the process.” It seemed very likely the former British prime minister’s remarks, delivered on a trip to Lebanon, had been coordinated with Washington to drive home the signal that “plans are in hand” to look for enduring solutions to the underlying Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The US is also reported to be studying options for when its recognition of a Palestinian state would come during the course of an eventual peace process, not necessarily leaving it until the end. Among the options,  ­according to a report by the Axios news site , are the bilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, forgoing the US veto on the UN security council vote admitting Palestine as a full member state (it has had non-member observer status  since a UN general assembly vote in 2012 ) and, third, encouraging other states to follow Washington’s lead in recognition. At the same time Saudi Arabia, which has not renounced its ­interest in normalising relations with Israel throughout the four months of the Gaza war, would offer to establish diplomatic relations with Israel in return for a ­substantial and “irrevocable” step towards Palestinian statehood. The thinking in the White House is apparently that such an offer from Riyadh would put  Benjamin Netanyahu  in a bind. His far-right coalition would never accept such a deal but would be robbed of US support if it did not. To stay in office, and thereby to elude the threat of prison as a result of the criminal corruption charges he faces, Netanyahu would have to dump his coalition partners and go looking for others, according to the plan. His fall or the creation of a new governing coalition would create space for diplomatic progress towards the elusive  two-state ­solution  for Israel and an independent Palestine. That in turn would create a happy synergy for Joe Biden in domestic politics by leading Arab-Americans,  particularly in the swing state of Michigan , to forgive him for his steadfast support of Israel in its Gaza campaign, thereby helping save his presidency. Meanwhile, a Saudi-Israeli concordat that achieved Palestinian statehood would reshape the Middle East, primarily at the expense of Iran, which has sought to project itself as a Palestinian champion in a time of occupation and persecution. It underpins Tehran’s projection of influence across the region. That, at least, is the plan. It is similar in most respects to the administration’s Middle East policy before 7 October but now with the added urgency caused by the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. The long history of the Israel-Arab conflict does indeed suggest that real progress only comes after extreme violence. Egypt’s defeat in the  1973 Yom Kippur war  led to the Camp David accords five years later. The quick US victory in the Gulf war gave it the clout to bring Israel and its Arab foes to the table at the Madrid conference in 1991. The first intifada uprising that began in 1987 ended with the ­initial Oslo accords in 1993 and the beginning of the process that was intended to establish two sovereign states living side by side. Conflict creates urgency in the search for alternatives, but urgency is not usually enough to produce results. The Madrid conference and the Oslo process, after showing great promise, ultimately failed in the face of the hard realities of the region. Another key ingredient, argues Aaron David Miller, a former state department negotiator on the Middle East, is leadership. In Saudi Arabia, Miller said, there is a leader ready to take risks in order to win prestige: crown prince  Mohammed bin Salman . “You have in Jerusalem a desperately risk-ready prime ­minister who, frankly, is fighting for his political life and most likely for his freedom,” said Miller, now a senior fellow at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “In order to have any chance of beating his indictment, he has to stay in power.” Miller suggested a bigger question hangs over how much of a political gamble Biden may be prepared to take, such as an early recognition of Palestinian statehood. “Presidents on this issue do not tend to be risk-ready during election years,” said Miller. “The basic problem is that time is not an ally of this process. It’s an adversary, because standing in the way of any of this happening are too many moving parts and too many obstructionists,” Miller added. “The most consequential election in American history is going to occur nine months from now. It’s just too complex – and they’re going to run out of time.” Among the problematic moving parts in such a deal are Saudi expectations from the US. Until now, Prince Mohammed has been insisting on a defence pact with Washington and ­technical ­support to build a Saudi nuclear power industry. Neither is likely to be approved by Congress. “Trump owns the Republican congressional caucus now and he will say to them: ‘Of course you’re not going to give this to Biden,’” said Daniel Levy, president of the US/Middle East Project thinktank. The success of the whole venture then would be dependent on the crown prince being content with the mere satisfaction of being godfather to a Palestinian state. It is unclear that would be enough to sway him. The second shaky assumption is that Netanyahu would see a Saudi normalisation deal and the consequent continuation of US support, rather than the safety of his existing hardline coalition, as being essential to his survival. “They [the Biden administration] think they can stitch this together and create circumstances where Netanyahu is in a bind and has to ditch his coalition allies, and I don’t see what they’re putting down as being enough to do that at all,” said Levy. “No one in Israel is going to say: ‘Oh my God, Bibi [Netanyahu] blew an opportunity for Saudi normalisation just because he wouldn’t agree to Palestinian state.’ Bibi will just turn around and say: ‘I’m the guy who got normalisation with other Gulf states without any concessions.’” Even if Netanyahu did decide to dissolve his coalition and look to patch together another, the ensuing election campaign would take months, and it is far from clear that other political leaders would be ready to become coalition partners with a man they despise for a minute longer than the continuing military campaign requires, or that they – most of the moderate right and centre – would be much more enthusiastic about the creation of a strong Palestinian state. Given that political ­reality – the absence of support across the Israeli political arena for a fully ­empowered Palestinian state – any formal recognition by western capitals or the UN security council would be largely symbolic, according to Rashid Khalidi, professor of modern Arab studies at Columbia University in New York. “It is literally meaningless,” Khalidi said. “Sovereignty, settlements, occupation: if they deal with those things, then it’s meaningful. But will they remove a half a million Israelis? No. Will they end military occupation? No. This government, the next government, the government after that, will not end the Israeli occupation of the West Bank.” On the Palestinian side, Hamas has long acted as the spoiler to any attempt at a two-state initiative, and the Gaza war has immeasurably strengthened the movement’s ­support in the West Bank. Nor is it clear what a  “revitalised” Palestinian Authority , proposed by US officials as the putative government of a new state, would look like. Its leadership, which has gone 18 years without a vote, would be unacceptable to most Palestinians. Up to now, elections have been blocked by Israel’s refusal to allow the people of East Jerusalem to take part. Such are the height and sheer slipperiness of the mountains ­diplomats would have to climb to make the plan work, in so short a time given the electoral ­calendar, that many Middle East experts ­suspect it may be little more than White House talking points designed to address the collapse in Arab-American support for Biden since the Gaza war ignited. “I think the driving force behind this, frankly, is not a careful appreciation of the political reality in Israel and in Palestine. It’s a desire to win the 2024 election by ­making it look like the president is doing ­something,” Khalidi said. “There’s a complete blindness to the realities of the two countries we’re talking about, Israel and Palestine, which means that this is essentially a show for the peanut gallery, a show for the American electorate. I think the possibility of them coming up with something that will actually fly is nil.”",

        "text": "Hundreds of health workers and supporters have taken part in a silent procession and vigil outside 10  Downing Street  calling for the  Prime Minister  to press for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. The procession, organised by Health Workers for  Palestine , began at  Westminster Bridge  on Saturday afternoon, in front of St Thomas’ Hospital, and finished at 10 Downing Street’s  Whitehall  entrance where speeches took place. UK healthcare workers attended in uniform, holding small coffins bearing the names of children who have died. The protesters carried banners saying “Stop Israel’s Gaza genocide” as well as Palestinian flags. The coffins were left on the ground opposite Downing Street as speakers took to the stage and the crowd chanted “ceasefire now” and “we believe that we will win”. Speakers included Ben Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Omar Abdel-Mannan, paediatric neurologist and co-founder of Health Workers for Palestine and Gaza Medic Voices, and Oxford City councillor Jabu Nala-Hartley. Samah Khan, aged nine and from east London, wrote a rap which she performed on stage. Beforehand, she said: “I am a nine-year-old girl and I know that there are loads of other nine-year-old girls in Gaza and they deserve what I have – food, water, medicine, a roof over their heads, but they don’t get that, but they deserve it. “So my message to the Israel government is: How would you feel? How would you feel if you were in their position? “And my message to the Palestinians is: We are with you, we are with you all the way.” Dr Abdel-Mannan told the PA news agency: “We’re here today as health workers, as doctors, nurses, paramedics, working in the NHS, standing together united horrified by what is happening inside Gaza, targeting of hospitals, systematic targeting of healthcare facilities. This is a silent procession to tell the Government that your silence is deafening Omar Abdel-Mannan “We are here in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Gaza and to send a message to our Government that your silence is complicit in this genocide and you must think about stopping the arming of Israel and to stop this complete massacre that is happening and about to happen in Rafah. “This is a silent procession to tell the Government that your silence is deafening and we will mirror that to show you that our numbers, and the people on the street, have had enough of watching this genocide unfold.” Silent processions were also due to take place at the same time across the world, including in Toronto, Kuala Lumpur, San Diego, Johannesburg, Paris, Kolkata, Belfast and Dublin. It comes after a Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 in which 1,300 people were killed and more than 240 kidnapped, before Israel retaliated with months of attacks on the Gaza Strip, killing and wounding thousands. The Palestinian death toll stands at almost 28,000 after four months of war, according to Gazan health officials.",

        "title": "ABC reporter Nour Haydar under fire over social media posts about Israel-Palestine conflict:  'Does she work for the ABC or Al-Jazeera?'",
        "description": "",
        "text": "An ABC political reporter has been accused of breaching the national broadcaster's strict impartiality guidelines after sharing controversial tweets about the conflict in Israel and surrounding fallout in Australia. Federal politics reporter Nour Haydar shared the tweets after the Palestinian militant group  Hamas  unleashed a horrific terrorist attack on the Jewish homeland on Saturday, killing hundreds of innocent civilians. Following the attacks, hundreds of protesters caused chaos outside the Opera House in  Sydney  shouting 'gas the Jews' and 'f*** the Jews,' prompting  NSW  premier Chris Minns to call off an upcoming Free  Palestine  rally.             ABC political reporter Nour Haydar has reposted numerous tweets about the Israel-Palestine conflict in recent days               Ms Haydar did not appear to support his decision to ban the upcoming protest, and shared a message from Palestinian activist Randa Abdel-Fattah. 'How is it possible that Palestinians in Australia are being policed for their language, protests, grief, called animals, accused of supporting terrorism, framed as instigators, and an Australian Jewish organisation openly calls for genocide,' the reposted tweet states. The comments were in response to the Australian Jewish Association supporting air strikes against Hamas targets in Gaza in retaliation to the terror attacks on Israel. According to the Gaza Health Ministry, the airstrikes have killed over 1,100 Palestinians. Officials have not said how many civilians are among the dead. 'Pure evil must be eradicated from this earth. Flatten it,' The Australian Jewish Association wrote.             The political journalist (pictured) has been with the ABC for six years and is based at Parliament House in Canberra  'Sometimes to eradicate pure evil, innocents die. It's sad Hamas hides among the civilian population. It's sad they don't love their own children to bring this on them. It's a double war crime.' Ms Haydar's recent online activity caught the attention of 2GB presenter Ray Hadley. 'I don't know whether that's covered by the ABC policy on social media, but she's reposted quite a number,' he told listeners. 'So we need to check with the boss of the ABC to see whether the postings by Nour Hadar, even though they were not her own words, whether they're in contravention of the ABC and their policy on social media postings.' Another retweet Ms Haydar shared was from The Guardian's Jerusalem correspondent, Bethan McKernan, which read: 'Initial reports surfacing that Israeli settlers indiscriminately opened fire on a crowd of Palestinians in Qusra near Nablus.' A third retweet from Human Rights Watch states: 'Deliberate killings of civilians, hostage-taking, and collective punishment are heinous crimes that have no justification.' Along with Hadley, some Aussies were quick to call out Ms Haydar over her retweets. 'Does Nour Haydar work for the ABC or Al-Jazeera? Thrilled to see taxpayer dollars paying the salary of a clearly biased ABC journalist. Another person added: The TwiXter feed of ABC racist Nour Haydar makes her sound like a PR agent for Hamas terrorists. The sort of dribble she retweets, all day, on our dime. Why are ABC activists supporting the terrorists on our dime.' An ABC spokeswoman didn't respond to questions of whether the retweets were appropriate or if any action will be taken. 'This is a personal social media account, not an ABC account or ABC content,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'All staff are required to meet the ABC Social Media guidelines.'",

        "description": "The Evangelical Lutheran Christmas Church in Bethlehem put out a crèche, but the baby Jesus — wrapped in a kaffiyeh, the black-and-white checkered scarf that is a badge of Palestinian identity — was lying not in a makeshift cradle of hay and wood but among broken bricks, stones and tiles.",
        "text": "Written by Isabel Kershner and Hiba Yazbek Israeli leaders vowed Sunday to pursue  their war against Hamas,  even as Israel’s own casualties mounted, with 15 soldiers reported killed in the Gaza Strip since Friday. “The war is exacting a very heavy cost from us,” Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  told Israelis. “However, we have no choice but to continue to fight.” All but one of the 15 soldier deaths were Friday and Saturday. Netanyahu said Israel was intensifying its campaign in Gaza. About 200 targets were hit over a 24-hour period, according to the military. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesperson, said Saturday that soldiers were fighting in a “dense area” above ground in southern Gaza’s largest city, Khan Younis, and that more forces would join a division that was working underground there to destroy tunnels operated by Hamas. Fighting in the north, where Israel says it has gained control of what it described as Hamas strongholds, has also intensified, Hagari said. Also Sunday, the Gaza Health Ministry said dozens of people were killed in airstrikes in Maghazi, a neighbourhood in central Gaza. Ministry officials blamed Israeli airstrikes for the deaths. The Israeli military said it was reviewing. In interviews with  The New York Times , witnesses in the area described the sky lighting up in red as strikes continued. “The rockets shake the room, the glass is shattered, the windows are broken,” said Safaa Al-Hasanat, who is staying at Maghazi. “Our kids are in a state of unimaginable fear,” she added. “It’s a terrifying situation in every sense of the word.” With the humanitarian crisis for the 2.2 million people of Gaza worsening by the day, international pressure has been growing on Israel to halt the intense air and ground campaign begun after Hamas forces crossed into Israel on Oct. 7 and massacred an estimated 1,200 people. Even the United States, Israel’s closest ally, has been urging the Israeli military to move to more targeted tactics, in the hope that fewer civilians will be killed. The Palestinian death toll in Gaza is reported by health authorities there to be about 20,000. But while Israel has signalled in recent days that it would shift to a less intense phase in the campaign, Netanyahu struck a defiant tone Sunday, a day after speaking privately with President  Joe Biden  in what was described as a “long talk.” “I told President Biden yesterday that we will fight until absolute victory — however long that takes,” Netanyahu said in remarks at the start of a weekly Cabinet meeting. “The US understands this.” The United States has backed humanitarian “pauses” in the fighting in Gaza to allow aid in to a population lacking even the most basic of daily necessities. But Saturday, after speaking with the Israeli leader, Biden said, “I did not ask for a cease-fire.” Netanyahu, whose popularity at home has plunged since the Hamas forces defeated Israeli security measures Oct. 7, killing civilians and soldiers alike with little resistance, appeared at pains to make clear that the US was not calling the shots. “Israel is a sovereign state,” Netanyahu said, adding that the country’s wartime decisions were “not dictated by external pressure.” He specifically rejected suggestions that the US had tried to rein in Israel’s military activity in the region, an apparent reference to reports that Biden had advised the Israeli leader against carrying out a preemptive strike against Hezbollah, the powerful militia in Lebanon, which could widen the war. With most of the civilian population of Gaza driven from their homes by the Israeli assault, reports from the territory Sunday were bleak. “We have nothing to keep us warm and dry,” said Heba Ahmad, 36. “We are living in conditions that I could have never in my entire life imagined were possible.” As temperatures dropped and rain fell, Ahmad said she and her husband, Ehab Ahmad, were cradling their two youngest children tightly between them at night, relying on body heat and a thin blanket to try to keep them warm as water and gusts of wind came through the holes of their makeshift tent. When the family of seven fled to the southern Gaza district of Mawasi three weeks ago to try to escape the Israel bombardment, winter was already creeping in. Now, Ahmad and his eldest sons spend their days looking for firewood and even just cardboard to keep a small fire going to cook and stay warm. “I’m speaking to you while the smoke from the fire is blinding me,” Ahmad said in a phone interview Sunday. In the background, someone could be heard coughing uncontrollably. The rainy weather held one silver lining: It offered a short break from the family’s daily struggle to find water. They said they had placed a bucket outside their tent to collect rainwater, and were using it to cook and to wash themselves and their clothing. For Israel, the report that 15 soldiers were killed in 72 hours was likely to hit hard. Another soldier died on the northern border with Jordan, where Israel has been clashing with Hezbollah forces. In a country where most Jewish 18-year-olds are drafted for mandatory military service, and people often volunteer in the reserves into middle age, many families have an intimate connection with the military. More than 300 soldiers were killed during the Hamas-led attacks Oct. 7, and more than 150 more have been killed in Gaza since Israel began its ground offensive in response to the assault. The death and destruction in Gaza have reverberated across the region. In Bethlehem this weekend, as  Christmas  neared, a season of celebration was instead one of mourning. Gone were the customary musical festivities. Gone was the tree-lighting ceremony. And gone were the extravagant decorations that normally bedeck the city that many revere as the birthplace of Jesus. On a live streamed worship session in the Lutheran Christmas Church in Bethlehem, Reverend Dr. Munther Isaac gave a Christmas message criticising those who are complicit in Israel’s ongoing bombardment of Gaza and words of encouragement to the Palestinian people.  pic.twitter.com/nzq4OlETGJ — Middle East Eye (@MiddleEastEye)  December 24, 2023 The Evangelical Lutheran Christmas Church in Bethlehem did put out a crèche, but the baby Jesus — wrapped in a kaffiyeh, the black-and-white checkered scarf that is a badge of Palestinian identity — was lying not in a makeshift cradle of hay and wood but among broken bricks, stones and tiles. “We’ve been glued to our screens, seeing children pulled from under the rubble day after day,” said the pastor of the church, the Rev. Munther Isaac. “We’re broken by these images. God is under the rubble in Gaza, this is where we find God right now.” Stay informed with access to our award-winning journalism.

Ms Riley posted photos of herself speaking in Parliament Square on X, formerly known as  Twitter , alongside the caption: 'Proud to have marched alongside Kurds, Iranians, Ukrainians and each and every person who gave up their time today to say NO to antisemitism.' Her post included a copy of her speech which urged people to stop being 'bystanders' and join in the fight to stop antisemitism. She said: 'We've learned from history the sharp price to be paid when good people stay silent and I'm grateful to each and every one of you here today for refusing to be bystanders.

'We're going to start having to have tough conversations. We're going to have to stand up to the mob and we're going to need strong stomachs. 'But together I believe we can and we will.' Ms Oberman, 57, and Mr Marsan also spoke to the crowds in Parliament Square today, after thousands attended a march in central London. Mr Marsan questioned why there 'were many who were hesitant to acknowledge or condemn the actions of Hamas'. He told the rally: 'At a time when our country is tearing itself apart and racist attacks are on the increase because of a conflict that has two just causes, surely our job is to tell both stories - not just tell one and deny the other because it's fashionable.' Ms Oberman called antisemitism an 'incitement to hatred, it is an incitement to divide' and argued that bigotry was on the rise.

'I have so many friends and neighbours and people who contact me on social media saying they will take their mezuzahs off their doors, that they feel frightened, they feel isolated and alone. 'But we are not alone. We are a successful and flourishing multi-ethnic and multi-faith capital city of a multi-ethnic and multi-faith country. 'A tolerant democracy where all racism, including racism against Jews, is not tolerated.

        "description": "",
        "text": "The United States is urging Israel to abandon its heavy bombing of the Gaza Strip in favour of more targeted operations aimed at capturing or killing top  Hamas  leaders. It comes as the death toll in Gaza approaches 20,000 from weeks of bombardment. About 1,200 people in Israel were killed in the 7 October Hamas attack, according to the Israel Defense Forces. White House  national security adviser  Jake Sullivan  said there would be a “transition to another phase of this war” that is “focused in more precise ways on targeting the leadership and on intelligence-driven operations”. Mr Sullivan, who met with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, was briefed on “objectives, phasing, and setting conditions for shifts over time from high-intensity clearing operations to lower intensity surgical operations against Hamas remnants” during his meetings in Tel Aviv. The White House said Mr Sullivan “described US efforts in coordination with allies and partners to deter any attempt to expand the conflict regionally, including in the Red Sea, and expressed President Biden’s commitment to restoring calm along the Blue Line [the unofficial frontier between Lebanon and Israel] through a combination of deterrence and diplomacy”. The timing of such a transition is unclear but remains part of “intensive discussion between the United States and  Israel ,” a top White House aide said. Mr Sullivan, who left Israel on Friday, also said in a statement that his Israeli counterpart, Tzachi Hanegbi, had informed him that the Israeli government is now allowing the use of the Kerem Shalom border crossing for delivery of aid into Gaza. “We welcome this significant step,” he said, adding that President  Joe Biden  had personally raised the matter with Mr Netanyahu. Mr Sullivan also said that the US “remains committed to expanding and sustaining the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza” and “will continue to work closely with Egypt and other partners” to ensure that aid continues to flow into Gaza through the Rafah border crossing as well. “We hope that this new opening will ease congestion and help facilitate the delivery of life-saving assistance to those who need it urgently in Gaza,” he added.

        "text": "Top Iranian military commanders were among the seven Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp (IRGC) officials killed in an airstrike on the country’s consulate building in Damascus, Syria, according to Iranian officials and state-affiliated media, which blamed Israel for the attack.\n     \n            Iran’s Foreign Ministry said that senior IRGC commander Mohammed Reza Zahedi was killed in the attack. Haji Rahimi was named as the second commander killed in the attack, according to the IRGC statement shared by state news agency IRNA later on Monday.\n     \n            The IRGC statement named five other officials who were killed: Hossein Aman Elahi, Mehdi Jalalati, Mohsen Sedaghat, Ali Aghababaee, and Ali Salehi Roozbahani.\n     \n            People gathered around the flattened building in Syria’s capital, according to photographs of the scene. Footage of the aftermath of the blast, published by Iranian state media Press TV, showed extensive damage, fire and smoke at the scene.\n     \n      \n       Related article \n       The Middle East on the brink again after attack on Iranian consulate \n     \n            Speaking on camera to reporters in Damascus, Iranian ambassador Hossein Akbari alleged that the consulate building, located next to the Iranian embassy, “was targeted with six missiles from Israeli F-35 warplanes.”\n     \n            Iranian embassy staff and military advisers were among the dead, he added﻿. It is unclear if any of the IRCG officials were diplomatic staff and CNN cannot independently verify the claims or casualty figures.\n     \n            In a separate interview, Akbari added that two Syrian policemen were also among the injured in the attack, which he said “is perhaps the first time that the Zionist regime allows itself to attack an official building of the Islamic Republic of Iran embassy, which had the flag of the Islamic Republic raised on top of it.”\n     \n            Asked for comment on the incident by CNN, the Israel Defense Forces said it does not comment on foreign reports. However, a military spokesperson told CNN that Israel believes the Iranian building hit in the attack is a “military building of Quds forces” and not a consulate.\n     \n            “According to our intelligence, this is no consulate and this is no embassy. I repeat, this is no consulate and this is no embassy. This is a military building of Quds forces disguised as a civilian building in Damascus,” Israeli Defense Forces spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told CNN’s Jim Sciutto. CNN cannot verify the claim.\n     \n            When asked if Israel was involved in the attack, Hagari said, “I’m not going to comment on that strike but I want to tell you that in the last six months, Iran is making this region escalate. She’s the main actor.”\n     \n            “[Iran] is the main actor that makes atrocities in this region using the proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen,” Hagari said.\n     \n            “Even this morning, an Iranian UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] has hit an Israeli base in Eilat,” Hagari claimed. “Iran is an actor that brings escalation.”\n     \n            Four unnamed Israeli officials acknowledged that Israel carried out the attack in Damascus, the New York Times reported.\n     \n            Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, Nasser Kanaani, warned of possible “reciprocal measures,” following the incident.\n     \n            “Iran preserves the right to take reciprocal measures and will decide the type of response and punishment against the aggressor,” Kanaani said, according to IRGC-affiliated Fars News.\n     \n            The foreign ministers of Iran and Syria also accused Israel of authoring the attack, with Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian calling it a “violation of all international obligations and conventions” and demanding a “serious response” from the international community.\n     \n            Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad described the strike as a “gross violation of international regulations, especially the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,” according to a readout of his call with Amir-Abdollahian.\n     \n            Zahedi, the slain commander, was previously the commander of IRGC’s ground forces, the commander of IRGC’s air force, and the deputy commander of the IRGC’s operations.\n     \n            Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah group issued a statement on Tuesday local time, accusing Israel of the strike, and warned that Israel would pay, vowing revenge.\n     \n            United States State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US did not “have confirmation either of the target or the responsible party” at a briefing on Monday.\n     \n            “Before we have gathered information about what exactly this was, I don’t want to speak to it specifically,” Miller added. “But of course, we’re always concerned about anything that would be escalatory or cause an increase in conflict in the region.”\n     \n            The Russian Foreign Ministry “strongly condemned” the attack in a statement published on its website on Monday, saying “any attacks on diplomatic and consular facilities to be categorically unacceptable.”\n     \n            It also called on “the Israeli leadership to abandon the practice of provocative military actions in Syria and other neighboring countries, which can lead to the extremely dangerous consequences throughout the region.”\n     \n             This is a developing story and will be updated.",

        "title": "US will ‘work to extend’ four-day peace between Israel and Hamas, Biden says",
        "description": "",
        "text": "President  Joe Biden  called on  Israel  and leaders of  Hamas  to work towards a deal  that would extend a negotiated truce  in the bloody conflict that erupted last month on Sunday after several hostages  including a young American girl  were released by the militant group. The US leader spoke from Nantucket, Massachusetts, on Sunday shortly after officials confirmed that four-year-old Abigail Idan had been among the latest hostages turned over to the Red Cross by Hamas on Sunday. While her current status wasn’t immediately clear, the president said that he, the first lady, and millions of Americans were “praying for the fact that she is going to be all right”. Mr Biden said in his remarks that he hoped the temporary peace that began on Friday would be extended to allow for the safe return of more hostages and the transfer of further aid to innocent Palestinians caught in the brutal siege of Gaza. Some 14,800 are thought to have been killed since the conflict began. “Under this deal, fighting in Gaza has now been paused for three days. Over that time, 58 hostages have been released, including Thai, Filipino, and Russian nationals. Dozens of families have been reunited,” said the president. The president’s goal, he said, was to “keep this pause going beyond tomorrow”. “[T]his deal is structured so that it can be extended to keep building on these results. That’s my goal,” said Mr Biden. He also lauded the US’s work, along with other countries including Egypt, to ensure the transfer of aid via trucks into the  Gaza Strip  as the truce continues. “We’ve moved approximately 200 aid trucks into Gaza per day,” said Mr Biden. “This deal is delivering life-saving results. Critically-needed aid is going in, and hostages are coming out.” {\"data\":{\"url\":\"https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1728822912151429262\",\"isConversation\":false}} The US leader’s comment about having spent “weeks” calling for a pause in the fighting is notable. It comes as he is facing intense public pressure from the left wing of his own party to call for an end to the hostilities in the region and the establishment of a permanent state for the Palestinian people. Mr Biden has rejected calls for an end to the Israeli military campaign, which he has asserted is within Israel’s rights as the country responds to a deadly terrorist attack in October that killed roughly 1,200 people. Massive rallies have been held in Washington DC, New York and other cities as a growing segment of Americans give the president low marks for his handling of the US’s role in the war. The president has also dismissed the possibility, again supported by progressives, of conditioning military aid to Israel on an end or curtailment of the bombing campaign in northern Gaza. Israel’s leaders maintain that they will continue their siege of the Gaza Strip once the four-day truce expires on Monday.",

        "description": "Israel’s Supreme Court has ruled unanimously that the military must begin drafting ultra-Orthodox men for military service",
        "text": "Israel’s Supreme Court ruled unanimously Tuesday that the military must begin drafting ultra-Orthodox men for military service — a decision that could lead to the collapse of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition as  Israel  wages war in  Gaza . Most Jewish men and women in Israel are required to serve mandatory military service at the age of 18. But the politically powerful ultra-Orthodox traditionally received exemptions if they were studying full-time in religious seminaries. These exemptions infuriated the wider general public, especially as hundreds of soldiers were killed in the war with  Hamas . Israel and Hamas appear to be moving further apart over how the cease-fire deal plays out. Netanyahu said he will only accept a partial cease-fire deal that would not end the eight-month-long war, casting doubt on the viability of a United States-backed truce proposal. Israeli leaders are also increasingly signaling that a war with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah could be next. Israel launched the war after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted about 250. Since then, Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 37,600 people in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.  International criticism is growing over Israel’s campaign as Palestinians face widespread hunger. The war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and basic goods to Gaza, which is now totally dependent on aid. The top United Nations court has concluded there is a “plausible risk of genocide” in Gaza — a charge Israel strongly denies. Currently: — Israel's Supreme Court says ultra-Orthodox must serve in the military. — Netanyahu says he won’t agree to a deal that ends the war in Gaza, testing the latest truce proposal. — Experts say Gaza is at high risk of famine despite increased aid to the north. — Iranian presidential candidates debate foreign policy ahead of Friday vote. — A WHO official says the U.S.-built pier in Gaza not sufficient in delivering aid to Palestinians. — Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war. Here's the latest:  Israel's Supreme court rules that ultra-Orthodox men can no longer be exempt from the military draft  JERUSALEM — Israel’s Supreme Court ruled unanimously Tuesday that the military must begin drafting ultra-Orthodox men for military service, a decision that could lead to the collapse of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition as Israel continues to wage war in Gaza. The court ruled that, in the absence of a law that distinguishes between Jewish seminary students and other draftees, Israel’s compulsory military service system applies to the ultra-Orthodox like any other citizens. Under longstanding arrangements, ultra-Orthodox men have been exempt from the draft, which is compulsory for most Jewish men and women. These exemptions have long been a source of anger among the secular public, a divide that has widened during the war. Politically powerful ultra-Orthodox parties, key partners in Netanyahu’s governing coalition, oppose any change in the current system. If the exemptions are ended, they could bolt the coalition, causing the government to collapse and leading to new elections. The court decision comes at a sensitive time, as the war in Gaza drags on into its ninth month and the number of dead soldiers continues to mount.  Israeli strikes kill at least 14 people in Gaza City  CAIRO — Israeli strikes on Gaza City early Tuesday killed at least 14 people, including three women and five children, officials in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip said. The strikes hit two schools-turned-shelters and a residential home, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defense, a rescue body that is often the first to respond after airstrikes. The Israeli military said Hamas militants were operating inside the school compounds, accusing them of planning attacks against Israel and being involved in holding hostages taken from Israel. A strike on the Abdel-Fattah Hamoud school in the Daraj neighborhood killed at least seven people from the same family, including five children and their parents, the Civil Defense said. An 18-month-old was among the dead, according to the Civil Defense. The group said a second strike hit the Asmaa school in the Shati camp, killing at least five people. The third strike hit a family house in the Shijaiyah neighborhood, killing two women, the civil defense said. Israel has escalated its air raids on Gaza City over the past week, killing dozens of people as Israeli ground forces continue battling Palestinian militants in the southern city of Rafah. Israel launched its air and ground invasion of Gaza immediately after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, which killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. The Israeli offensive has killed over 37,000 Palestinians and unleashed a humanitarian crisis.",

AP \n\n\n\n In late November, Sheikh Nawaf was rushed to hospital for an unspecified illness.  \n\n\n\n In the time since, the tiny, oil-rich nation had been waiting for news about his health.  \n\n\n\n State-run news previously reported that he traveled to the United States for unspecified medical checks in March 2021. \n\n\n\n The health of Kuwait’s leaders remains a sensitive matter in the Middle Eastern nation bordering Iraq and Saudi Arabia, which has seen internal power struggles behind palace doors. \n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t 4 \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Sheikh Ahmad Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah addresses the 78th United Nations General Assembly at UN headquarters in New York City on Sep. 21, 2023.

        "title": "As calls grow for a tougher response to Houthi attacks on Red Sea ships, Biden officials meet to discuss military options",
        "description": "The options include strikes on Houthi targets inside Yemen. To date, the White House hasn’t approved any strike options that were prepared by the U.S. military.",
        "text": "WASHINGTON — Amid growing calls for President Joe Biden to order a stronger military response to repeated attacks by Houthi rebels on shipping in the Red Sea, members of his national security team convened a White House meeting Wednesday to review possible options, including strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, according to two current administration officials. The meeting Wednesday afternoon was aimed at fleshing out details of various options that are more robust than those the White House has previously considered, which could include responding alongside other countries, the officials said. It was a principal deputies committee meeting, chaired by deputy national security adviser Jon Finer, with the goal of ultimately presenting the president with a list of military options. So far, the White House has not approved any of the options for strikes on  the Yemen-based rebels  that have been prepared by the U.S. military, current and former officials said.  After the Houthis launched their most direct attack on the U.S. military on New Year's Eve, firing on U.S. Navy helicopters from small boats,  the helicopters returned fire , sinking three boats and killing 10 fighters, the U.S. military said. According to the officials, U.S. Central Command provided Defense Department leaders with options for an additional military response after the incident, and the Pentagon sent those options to senior White House officials. Biden, who was on vacation in St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, did not approve an additional military response. Biden was updated multiple times on  the situation in the Red Sea  while on vacation.   An administration official denied that there have been disagreements between White House and U.S. military officials about responding to  the Houthis .  U.S. Navy ships and jets have also shot down drones and missiles fired by the Houthis on multiple occasions. Current defense officials, as well as former senior U.S. officials, have argued that shooting down drones is not enough to deter the increasingly bold attacks and want Biden to take more forceful action, the officials said. Also Wednesday, the White House partnered with other countries to issue a joint statement condemning the attacks and warning the Houthis about a possible response if they continue. The Biden administration hopes to build a coalition to pressure the Houthis, and their primary backer, Iran, to end the attacks on commercial shipping, and if the attacks continue, administration officials hope the response will include militaries from multiple countries. Roughly 12% of global shipping passes through the Red Sea every day, and after repeated attacks, shipping giants like  Maersk have announced pauses in their operations in the Red Sea  and the Gulf of Aden in recent days, which will add time and money to delivery of goods. Now administration officials are weighing concerns that a military strike in Yemen would expand the war in Gaza and draw the U.S. into a regional conflict against worries about a massive disruption to global trade and the impact on the world’s economy. On Tuesday, Houthi rebels fired two anti-ship ballistic missiles into the southern Red Sea, the 24th attack against ships in the area since Nov. 19. U.S. Central Command  wrote on X  that the missiles did not hit any of the “multiple commercial ships in the area” that reported the missiles splashing down in the water. “These illegal actions endangered the lives of dozens of mariners and continue to disrupt the free flow of international commerce,” CENTCOM warned. Tuesday’s attack was one of the Houthi rebels’ least aggressive in recent weeks. On Dec. 15, a Houthi drone struck a commercial ship, the Al Jasrah, causing a fire on board, and four hours later a Houthi missile hit the MV Palatium 3, also igniting a fire on the ship. Neither ship reported any injuries. And on Dec. 3, the Houthis fired a series of drones and missiles at commercial ships and toward U.S. Navy ships over nearly eight hours, striking three ships. The USS Carney responded to the ships’ distress calls and shot down several   incoming drones, according to CENTCOM.   The largest volley of projectiles fired to date was on Dec. 26, when at least 12 drones and five missiles were fired into the southern Red Sea over 10 hours. The USS Laboon and U.S. Navy F/A-18 Super Hornets shot down the drones and missiles, and no ships were damaged.  In the incident Sunday, the Houthis fired on U.S. Navy helicopters responding to a distress call from a commercial ship being threatened by Houthi small boats. The U.S. military said its lethal response was in self-defense and marked the first time a recent confrontation at sea had turned fatal.

        "description": "",
        "text": "A masked anti-Israel protestor was caught on video spitting on a banner bearing the word 'Jewish' outside the NYU library on Thursday.  The incident occurred during a rally calling on the university to scrap its study abroad program in  Israel  over the strikes in  Gaza  - but it is not clear if the man is affiliated with NYU and police kept him away from the main protest.  The video was shared by StopAntisemitism on X, formerly  Twitter , with the caption: ' NYC  - a masked man at NYU’s library is seen tearing off the “Jewish” from his sign, throwing it down, and spitting onto it.  'This is nothing short of horrifying Nazi like rhetoric of 1933  Germany .'                           One photo showed the protestor being kept away from the main protest by police officers             The man spat on the sign on the floor before raising his fist and walking away The man, wearing a black ski mask and leather gloves with a large silver cross dangling from his neck was carrying a huge sign reading 'Jewish White Supremacy'.  In the video, he tears the word 'Jewish' from the placard, throws it on the floor and spits on it.  One onlooker called him a 'coward' and told him to 'take the mask off', at which point he pulled down the mask and spit on the sign a second time.  Someone shouted: 'Do it on me, I'm Jewish.'  Another person shouted: 'You're ruining their protest by doing this.'  One said: 'Your own mother is ashamed of you. Your ancestors are ashamed of you.'   The man then raised his fist in the air and someone said: 'You're a neo Nazi, you've got to stop it.'  He then picked up his sign and left, he is not thought to be affiliated with NYU.                  The man tore the word Jewish from his sign and spat on it - police kept him away from the rest of the protest. At the main student protest, around 100 students and faculty gathered to call on NYU to shut down its study abroad program in Tel Aviv and divest from companies supporting Israeli war efforts.  Some protestors carried signs reading 'Shut down NYU Tel Aviv' while chanting 'shut down sites where students are banned, Tel Aviv is stolen land.' Around 20 counter-protestors gathered to the side, waving Israeli flags and holding up posters featuring the faces of Israeli hostages. NYU spokesperson John Beckman told the independent student newspaper, Washington Square News, that the university has no intentions of closing its study away program in Israel.  He said: 'As to the demands from the demonstrators that NYU close the NYU Tel Aviv site — the university rejects those demands. NYU is fully committed to the continued presence of the NYU Tel Aviv program, and the university believes that calls for academic boycotts are at odds with the fundamental tenets of academic freedom and the free exchange of ideas.'",

        "description": "Long-haul carrier Emirates has signaled it will hold off on a major purchase of Airbus A350 aircraft over concerns about their Rolls Royce engines, marking a major blow for the European manufacturer as it hopes to close the sale during the Dubai Air Show",
        "text": "Long-haul carrier Emirates signaled Tuesday it will hold off on a major purchase of  Airbus  A350 aircraft over concerns about their  Rolls Royce  engines, marking a major blow for the European manufacturer as it hopes to close the sale during the  Dubai  Air Show this week.  Emirates President Tim Clark's comments to journalists at the show came the day after his airline announced a $52 billion purchase with Airbus' rival Boeing Co., while its sister airline FlyDubai bought another $11 billion of aircraft from Boeing.  Ethiopian Airlines said it was buying 31 aircraft from Boeing. Mesfin Tasew, the group CEO, made the announcement, saying the airline also signed options to potentially purchase another 36 aircraft as well. Airbus has yet to strike a major deal at the show, which comes as global airlines like Emirates have bounced back from the lockdowns of the coronavirus pandemic with increased global demand for travel. In his comments to journalists at the Emirates chalet on the runway of Al Maktoum International Airport, Clark raised concerns about the maintenance required for the Rolls Royce engines on the A350.  “If the engine was doing what we want it to do ... then it would re-enter the mix of assessment for our fleet plan,” Clark said.  Airbus and Rolls Royce did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.  Emirates is a heavyweight when it comes to East-West travel out of Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest for international travel.  Clark also said that Emirates needs to buy aircraft now as it moves forward with plans to expand its routes and networks.  “Irrespective of the difficulties of getting these aircraft out of the door, we have to place orders now because the lead time for deliveries are so long,” Clark said.  Clark also said that the tensions in the wider Middle East sparked by the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip wouldn't affect Emirates' business, adding they are used to working around the region's geopolitical problems. He said although the Israeli market was one of the fastest growing markets for Emirates, they had to stop their daily flights to Tel Aviv, Israel, but that the airline was able to absorb the demand fall-off. Emirates and FlyDubai launched direct flights to Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv after the two countries established diplomatic ties in 2020.  Two major Israeli firms — Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. and Israel Aerospace Industries had been slated to participate in the Dubai Air Show. But the IAI stand, bearing the slogan “Where Courage Meets Technology,” was roped off and empty Monday. On Tuesday, a few people gathered there.  Also in the market for aircraft is Riyadh Air, a new Saudi carrier being created as part of trillions of dollars worth of spending planned in the kingdom. In March, the airline announced an order of up to 72 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner jetliners and has further plans to expand. Clark said he wasn't worried about the competition, however.  “If Saudi Arabia wants to spend $2 trillion on doing wonderful things over there, they’ve got to have the labor from somewhere. And that labor force has got to be brought in, and their carriers are going to find it difficult in the early stages to meet that demand,\" he said. “So do I think it’s a problem with this lot? No, I don’t … because we managed to build Emirates through all of this competition, rising geopolitical socioeconomic difficulty.”  The air show, which sees billions of dollars worth of deals, as arms manufacturers exhibit at the show, comes two weeks before Dubai hosts the United Nations' COP28 climate talks.  Aviation has particularly drawn the ire of climate change activists, in part due to the amount of jet fuel the industry burns. Emirates in January successfully flew a Boeing 777 on a test flight with one of its two engines entirely powered by so-called sustainable aviation fuel. Earlier this month, the airline cleared SAF for flights, including one to Sydney, Australia.  However, “decarbonizing civil aviation is incredibly difficult and will be long term,” Clark said.  Meanwhile Tuesday, other purchases included: — Emirates announced $1.2 billion in deals with French firm Safran, including for seats.  — Emirates announced plans for a $950 million maintenance facility at Al Maktoum International Airport, the city-state's second airfield.  — EgyptAir announced it would buy 10 Airbus A350-900s. It did not disclose the price of the aircraft.  — Boeing and SCAT Airlines of Kazakhstan announced the airline would purchase seven Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. It also did not disclose terms for the sale.  ___ Associated Press writer Jon Gambrell contributed to this report.",

        "description": "The U.N. aid agency serving Palestinians in Gaza faces more funding cuts amid accusations that 12 of its employees were involved in Oct. 7 attack that sparked the Israel-Hamas war",
        "text": "The U.N. aid agency serving  Palestinians  in Gaza faced more funding cuts Monday amid accusations that 12 of its employees were involved in the Oct. 7 attack that sparked the Israel- Hamas  war. An  Israeli  document obtained by The Associated Press on Monday details Israeli claims that U.N. teachers and a social worker employed by the agency, known as  UNRWA , allegedly stormed into Israel that day, in some cases helping to take hostages or coordinating weapons’ transfers. The allegations over the weekend triggered a wave of funding cuts by major donors, including the U.S., Britain and France. Austria said Monday that it would suspend its financial assistance. UNRWA employs roughly 13,000 Palestinians in Gaza and says it will be forced to halt operations within weeks if funding isn’t restored. The war has led to a humanitarian catastrophe that has displaced the vast majority of the embattled enclave’s population and caused widespread hunger. Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7 killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. About 250 people were taken captive, according to Israeli authorities. It set off a brutal air, sea and ground offensive by Israel's military that has killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, most of them women and minors, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. It has also threatened to set off a wider regional conflict.

Here's the latest:  GERMANY CONDEMNS ATTACK ON US TROOPS IN JORDAN  BERLIN — Germany has condemned the fatal attack on U.S. troops in Jordan that Washington has blamed on Iran-backed militias and is calling on Tehran to exert its influence on regional allies to prevent further escalation. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Sebastian Fischer on Monday underlined Berlin’s solidarity with Jordan and the U.S. He added that “in view of the extremely tense situation in the region, this act is completely irresponsible and could lead to pushing the region further toward escalation.” Fischer said: “We expect from Iran that it finally exert its influence on its allies in the region so that there is no uncontrolled conflagration, in which no one can have an interest.  5 PALESTINIANS KILLED BY ISRAELI FORCES IN THE WEST BANK  RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinian authorities say five Palestinians, including a 16-year old boy, have been killed by Israeli forces in separate shootings across the occupied West Bank on Monday. The Palestinian Health Ministry said the boy was killed near the Israeli settlement of Tekoa. The ministry gave no further details, but the Israeli military said the boy had attempted to carry out a stabbing attack on soldiers at a guard post. In other violence, the Palestinian Health Ministry said two men, one of them age 18, were shot dead by Israeli troops in the southern West Bank city of Dura. The official Palestinian news agency Wafa said that Israeli forces opened fire after clashing with Palestinians from the area. Two other men were killed — one of them in the southern city of Hebron and the other in the central town of Silwad, it said. The Israeli army said one of its counterterrorism operations in the town of Dura overnight Sunday sparked a riot in the town. It said its forces then opened fire in response to dozens of Palestinian protesters hurling stones at its troops. In the town of Yamoun, near Jenin, Israeli forces said its troops returned fire at a wanted suspect they were trying to arrest, hitting the man.  EU SEEKS TO  APPOINT  EXPERTS TO CONDUCT AN AUDIT OF UNRWA  BRUSSELS — The European Union wants to appoint independent experts to conduct an audit of the U.N.’s Palestinian refugee agency to ensure that UNRWA staff can't be involved “in terrorist activities.” The 27-nation bloc is one of the biggest donors of humanitarian and development aid to Palestinians in Gaza, but was not scheduled to provide more funding to UNRWA before the end of February. Israel has accused a dozen UNRWA employees of taking part in the Hamas attack in October that ignited the war and stoked deadly instability across the Middle East. Several countries have frozen funding to the agency. The EU’s executive branch, the European Commission, says it “expects UNRWA to agree to carrying out an audit of the agency to be conducted by EU appointed independent external experts.” The audit would focus “specifically on the control systems needed to prevent the possible involvement of its staff in terrorist activities.”  IRAQ CONDEMNS DRONE STRIKE THAT KILLED 3 US TROOPS IN JORDAN  BAGHDAD — Iraq's government condemned the drone strike that killed three U.S. troops in Jordan near the Syrian border Sunday, in an apparent effort to distance itself from an attack that was likely carried out by one of the country's multiple Iranian-backed militias. Government spokesman Bassem al-Awadi said in a statement on Monday that Iraq is “monitoring with a great concern the alarming security developments in the region” and called for “an end to the cycle of violence.” The statement said that Iraq is ready to participate in diplomatic efforts to prevent further escalation. An umbrella group for Iran-backed factions known as the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has claimed dozens of attacks against bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria since the Israel-Hamas war began. On Sunday, the group claimed three drone attacks against sites in Syria, including near the border with Jordan, and one inside of “occupied Palestine” but so far hasn't claimed the attack in Jordan.  MAN WOUNDED IN ATTACK OUTSIDE ISRAELI MILITARY BASE  JERUSALEM — Israeli authorities say a 20-year-old man has been seriously wounded after an attack outside a military base in Haifa in northern Israel. The Israeli military said a motorist carried out a car ramming attack on Monday before exiting the vehicle and trying to attack soldiers with an ax. The soldiers shot at the attacker, the military said. It wasn't immediately clear if the attacker was killed. Israel’s rescue service Magen David Adom said that paramedics were treating a 20-year-old man with “serious lower limb injuries,” and had evacuated him to a hospital in serious condition. The attack came as tensions have spiked around the region over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Earlier this month, a woman was killed in a similar attack north of Tel Aviv.  AUSTRIA SUSPENDS PAYMENTS TO UNRWA  BERLIN — Austria is joining a string of Western partners in suspending payments to the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees after Israel accused a dozen of its employees of taking part in the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 that started the war. The Foreign Ministry in Vienna said in a statement Monday that Austria “will provisionally suspend all further payments to UNRWA in coordination with international partners” until all the accusations are “fully cleared up” and there is clarity on the consequences. It called on the UNRWA agency and the wider U.N. to conduct a “comprehensive, quick and complete investigation.”  JAPAN SUSPENDS FUNDING FOR THE UN AID AGENCY IN GAZA  TOKYO — Japan has suspended additional funding for UNRWA while the agency conducts an investigation into allegations that UNRWA staff were involved in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday. It said Japan is “extremely concerned about the alleged involvement of UNRWA staff members in the terror attack on Israel” last year. The ministry noted the dedication of many UNRWA staff in providing humanitarian assistance to Gaza and said: “Japan has been strongly urging UNRWA to conduct an investigation in a prompt and complete manner and to take appropriate measures, including strengthening governance with UNRWA, so that UNRWA can firmly fulfill the role it should play.”",

        "text": "Donald Trump  has revealed that his son Barron has \"made his choice\" of the college he wants to attend. After the 18-year-old  graduated from high school  in May, there were speculations about the future of his education. Trump previously said that Barron was \"very sought after\" by colleges. Barron, however, has remained silent.                 Donald Trump provides update on Barron's college decision(AP)         Barron accompanied his father to a  rally in Miami  on Tuesday, July 9. Introducing Barron to the crowd, Trump said, “This is a young man, he just turned 18. A very young man who is now going to college. Got into every college he wanted to and he made his choice. And he's a very good guy, I'll tell you… He's a very special guy, Barron Trump. This is the first time he's ever done this.\"       Barron stood up and briefly waved at the crowd, and pumped his fist. Trump then proudly said that Barron is \"pretty popular\" and \"might be more popular\" than his other sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.   \"Barron, it's good to have you,\" the former president said. \"Welcome to the scene, Barron. I don't know. He had such a nice easy life, now it's a little bit changed.\"   Which college could Barron choose? Barron’s college choice, however, is still publicly unknown. As per reports, the possibilities include New York University, Georgetown University and the University of Pennsylvania. Trump said in an interview with Megyn Kelly in September 2023 that Barron was \"thinking about\" attending his father’s educational institution – The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.   Last month, the former president suggested on Fox News’ Fox & Friends Weekend that Barron had to alter his college search due to \"rioting,” at a time when several pro-Palestinian protests were being held across university campuses in the US. \"Six months ago you look at a college, and you sort of want a certain college,\" Trump said. \"And then you see all of these colleges are rioting and maybe you want to go to a different kind of a college. Because there's plenty of colleges that we also like that are different and they don't riot.\"",

        "title": "Here are some key races to watch in the EU Parliament elections",
        "description": "Voters are casting ballots in two dozen languages in 27 countries with scores of different campaign issues.",
        "text": "It’s easy to get overwhelmed by the EU elections. Voters are casting ballots in two dozen languages in 27 countries with scores of different campaign issues. So here’s a look at some key places to watch in the June 6-9 elections for a  new European Parliament. Long-serving Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is expected to extend his party’s nearly 15-year streak of election victories when the Central European country votes in European Parliament elections on Sunday, but is facing one of the most formidable challenges of his career from a former ally. Orbán’s right-wing populist Fidesz party has taken more than 50 per cent of the vote in the last three EU elections, and looks poised to take the most votes again this year. But a new opposition force, headed by a former Fidesz insider turned Orbán critic, has in a matter of weeks grown to become Hungary’s largest opposition party, and will likely cause Fidesz to lose at least one seat in the parliament. Péter Magyar, a 43-year-old lawyer who was once married to Hungary’s former justice minister and Orbán ally Judit Varga, has shot to prominence since February on his public accusations of corruption and mismanagement within Orbán’s government. Magyar’s party, Respect and Freedom (TISZA), has presented itself as a more centrist alternative to Orbán’s brand of illiberal populism, and is likely to gain several seats in the EU legislature. It has also capitalised on an economic crisis and disaffection with Hungary’s traditional opposition parties to siphon away much of their support. Still, the social democratic Democratic Coalition, as well as the liberal party Momentum, could retain some of their seats, while the far-right Our Homeland party may send its first-ever delegate to Brussels after the Sunday vote. \nOrbán has cast the election as an existential struggle between war and peace, telling voters that casting their ballots for his opposition would draw Hungary directly into the war in neighbouring  Ukraine  and precipitate a global armed conflict. He has been in power since 2010. Premier Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party, which has neo-fascist roots, is forecast to sharply expand its number of seats in the European Parliament from seven in the last election, which could extend her influence in the EU. Her pro-Ukraine and Israel policies have proven reassuring to centrist American and European allies, but she is leading culture wars at home that preserve her far-right credentials. In Italy, the vote is not expected to destabilise the government, even if Meloni’s advantage will be at the expense of her partners in the governing coalition, the populist, anti-migrant right-wing Lega, led by Matteo Salvini, and the centre-right Forza Italia, led by Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani. Polling data forecasts that Brothers of Italy will get about a quarter of the vote, on par with the results of the 2022 national elections but well ahead of the last European parliamentary vote in 2019. The centre-left Democratic Party is polling to come in second, followed by the opposition 5-Star Movement. Italians ages 18 and over are eligible to cast ballots to elect 76 European parliamentary seats over two days, on June 8-9. French far-right leader Marine Le Pen and the anti-immigration, nationalist ideas she has long championed are expected to be big winners in the EU elections. Pollsters expect her National Rally party to win the most of France’s 81 seats, well ahead of President Emmanuel Macron’s moderate pro-business party. The National Rally’s lead European Parliament candidate, Jordan Bardella, promises to limit free movement of migrants within the EU’s open borders and dial back EU climate rules. The party no longer wants to leave the EU and the euro, but to weaken it from within. Many French voters will use the EU election to express dissatisfaction with Macron’s management of the economy, farming rules, or security. That could hurt him as he tries to lead Europe-wide efforts to defend Ukraine and boost the EU’s own defences and industry. On the left, polls show a surprising resurgence of France’s Socialist Party behind lead candidate Raphaël Glucksmann, who pledges a more ambitious climate policy and protections for European businesses and workers. Some left-wing voters are frustrated with the staunch pro-Palestinian stance of the influential far-left France Unbowed party. France has the largest Jewish community in Europe, as well as one of the largest Muslim populations, and the Israel-Hamas war has been a flashpoint in the election campaign. In Germany, which will have the largest number of the new European Parliament’s 720 seats at 96, the three parties in centre-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s unpopular governing coalition risk being punished by voters because of persistent squabbling and a weak economy. The mainstream centre-right opposition hopes to benefit and maintain its position as the strongest German party in Brussels as it looks ahead to a national election expected in the fall of next year. But much attention will be on the performance of the far-right Alternative for Germany, which has enjoyed strong support over the past year but has been hit by a string of setbacks going into the European election. Among those are scandals surrounding its top two candidates for the EU legislature. The party can expect to make gains on its performance in 2019, but perhaps not as much as it hopes. Voters in Slovakia will cast ballots in the European Union parliamentary elections on Saturday just weeks after an attempt to  assassinate populist Prime Minister Robert Fico. Analysts expect the event that sent shockwaves through the nation of 5.4 million to be a boost for turnout, which was the lowest of the entire bloc in 2014 and 2019. It’s also predicted to increase the chances of Fico’s leftist Smer (Direction) party, the senior partner in the governing coalition, to win the vote. Smer is in a close race against the main opposition Progressive Slovakia, a pro-Western liberal party. Fico’s group has been attacking the EU’s support for Ukraine, as well other policies on immigration, climate change and LGBTQ+ rights. Two other political groups are far behind: the Republic, a far-right party that wants Slovakia out of  NATO ; and Hlas (or the Voice), another leftist coalition party previously led by Fico’s close ally Peter Pellegrini, who will be inaugurated as the country’s president next week. Slovakia contests 15 seats in the election. Stay informed with access to our award-winning journalism. Avoid misinformation with trusted, accurate reporting.

        "title": "Starbucks and Workers United, long at odds, say they’ll restart labor talks",
        "text": "Starbucks  and the union organizing its U.S. workers said Tuesday they have agreed to begin talks with the aim of reaching  labor agreements . The announcement was a breakthrough for the two sides, which have been at odds since Workers United first organized baristas at a Starbucks store  in Buffalo, New York , in late 2021. “Starbucks and Workers United have a shared commitment to establishing a positive relationship in the interests of Starbucks partners,” Starbucks said in a statement. Workers United echoed those comments in a similar statement. Workers have voted to unionize at more than 370 company-owned Starbucks stores in the U.S., but none of those stores has reached a labor agreement with the company. The process has been contentious. In multiple cases, federal courts have  ordered Starbucks to reinstate workers  who were fired after leading unionization efforts at their stores. Regional offices of the National Labor Relations Board also have issued at least 120 complaints against Starbucks for unfair labor practices, including refusal to bargain and reserving pay raises and other benefits for non-union workers. \n     \n\n Starbucks said Tuesday that, in a sign of goodwill, it will provide workers in unionized stores with benefits it announced in May 2022, including the ability for customers to add a tip to their credit card payments. \n\n Starbucks was the first to indicate that it wanted a better relationship with the union. In December, the company said it wanted to restart labor ta  lks  with the goal of ratifying contract agreements in 2024. Before then, the two sides hadn’t spoken for seven months. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n During discussions last week, the two sides said it became clear there was “a constructive path forward on the broader issue of the future of organizing and collective bargaining at Starbucks.” Starbucks and Workers United said Tuesday that they also plan to discuss resolving  litigation between them . In October, Starbucks sued Workers United, saying a pro-Palestinian social media post from a union account early in  the Israel-Hamas war  angered hundreds of customers and damaged its reputation. The company demanded that the union stop using its name and likeness. Workers United countersued, saying Starbucks had defamed the union and implied it supported terrorism. “While there is plenty of work ahead, coming together to develop this framework is a significant step forward and a clear demonstration of a shared commitment to working collaboratively and with mutual respect,” the union said in a statement. Starbucks echoed those comments.",

        "description": "Kansas became the 10th state in the nation Wednesday to require two-person railroad crews over the objections of the freight railroads, but the industry may challenge the rule in court as it has in other states like Ohio",
        "text": "Kansas  became the 10th state in the nation Wednesday to require two-person railroad crews despite objections from freight railroads, but the industry may challenge the rule in court as it has in other states like  Ohio . The major freight railroads have long pushed to cut crews down to one person, but unions have resisted because they believe it’s safer to have two people working together to operate trains.  Gov.  Laura Kelly  said two-person crews “will protect workers from the effects of fatigue, prevent train derailments and reduce risks in the many Kansas communities along our railroad tracks.” The new administrative rule took effect Wednesday. The railroad industry maintains there isn't enough evidence to show that two-person crews are safer and many short-line railroads already operate with a single person aboard. “Regulatory efforts to mandate crew staffing such as the latest in Kansas lack a safety justification,” said spokesperson Jessica Kahanek with the Association of American Railroads trade group. Kahanek said she didn't want to speculate whether the industry will file a lawsuit challenging the Kansas rule the way it did in Ohio. The railroads generally argue in their lawsuits that the federal government should be the only one to regulate the industry to ensure there's a uniform set of rules. At least a dozen states impatient with the federal government's reluctance to pass new regulations on railroads have tried to pass restrictions on the industry related to minimum crew size, train length and blocked crossings. Both the Ohio and Kansas crew-size rules were proposed in the months after the fiery Norfolk Southern derailment in eastern Ohio in February. That crash forced thousands of people to evacuate their homes around East Palestine while hazardous chemicals burned in the days afterward. The cleanup continues and residents continue to worry about possible long-term health effects. The other states that have rules requiring two-person crews on the books are  California , Wisconsin, Arizona,  West Virginia . Minnesota, Washington, Nevada and Colorado. Those state regulations could be unnecessary if the Federal Railroad Administration approves a proposed rule to require two-person crews or if a package of rail safety reforms proposed in Congress that includes that requirement is approved. But the rail safety bill hasn't received a vote in the Senate or a hearing in the House, so it's prospects are uncertain.  Jeremy Ferguson, who leads the Transportation Division of the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers union that represents conductors, praised the new Kansas rule alongside the governor Wednesday. “We have all worked hard to show that safety comes first, and corporate profits will never be placed ahead of all the citizens of this great state,” Ferguson said. Kahanek, the industry spokesperson, said the railroads believe crew size should be determined by contract negotiations with the unions — not by regulations. Union Pacific is in the process of testing out how quickly a conductor in a truck can respond to problems on a train compared to the conductor aboard the locomotive, although the railroad is still maintaining two people at the controls of its trains during the test.",

        "title": "The Day of the Dead in Mexico is a celebration for the 5 senses",
        "description": "Mexicans are celebrating Day of the Dead, an intangible tradition borne down from pre-Hispanic cultures that is also a celebration for all the senses",
        "text": "The Day of the Dead in  Mexico  smells like cempasuchil flowers and copal incense. It has a sweet taste. Sounds and colors abound. There are photos, candles and music all over. The hands of artisans prepare the altars to honor their ancestors. Although it is an intangible tradition, borne down from pre-Hispanic cultures, Day of the Dead is also a celebration for all the senses —even if one of them is failing you. Gerardo Ramírez, who over the years become almost blind, sums it all up in one line: “You honor people, you connect with the past.” Day of the Dead celebrations in Mexico  THE SMELL THAT GUIDES YOU FROM THE UNDERWORLD  Together, two smells show dead souls the way out of the underworld: cempasúchil — a type of marigold whose name means “flower of 20 petals in Náhuatl language\" — and a tree resin called copal burned at altars. The native species of cempasúchil smells so strong you can almost hear it, said Verenice Arenazas, a young woman who traded her HR job for her family’s traditional flower field. “As soon as you move it, it tells you ‘here I am, look at me'\" she said. Her family this year produced 17,000 cempasúchil plants in Xochimilco, Mexico City’s famed canal-crossed southern borough. Arenazas’ family grows two types of cempasúchil: those grown by selecting seeds from the most potent-smelling flowers and those that are genetically modified. Both are nearly sold out, she said with a smile. Arenazas says the flowers smell like the \"sweet, fresh, honest work” of the farmers like her who dedicate unending days caring for the flowers. They also smell of “ Mexican  pride,” she said.  FOOD FOR THE DEAD  On the traditional altars honoring the dead, food is a symbol of Mother Earth. Even the sweetest bread, flavored with orange blossom, has grizzly origins. According to researchers at the Mexican School of Gastronomy, the dough was prepared by mixing honey and human blood as an offering to the gods. Other historians believe that  Spanish  colonizers, frightened by human sacrifices in Mexico, created a bread, dipped in sugar and painted it red, to symbolize a heart. Today there is a special place on altars for the dead person’s favorite food and drink. “The offering loses flavor,” explained Ramírez, “because the dead actually come back; what they eat is the essence.” Ramírez explained the communion between the living and the dead recalling an anecdote that marked him when he was a child. When his uncle died, the family placed his body on the dining table until the coffin arrived. Then they all sat down to eat there.  THE CREATIVE HANDS PREPARING THE ALTAR  Preparing an altar is a great pleasure to many Mexicans. “To feel the softness of the flowers, where you put the food, all the textures,” said Ramírez. “It's an explosion of sensations.\" Altars welcome all sorts of handicrafts, from papier-mache skeletons to alebrijes (imaginary animal figures), but“papel picado\" - very thin sheets of colored paper cut-outs - is essential. There are places where “papel picado” is still made with hammer and chisel, as in the workshop of Yuriria Torres, located south of  Mexico City . “It’s like sculpting” a work of art, says Torres, who still does the whole process by hand, eschewing stencils or laser cutters. Some people connect Torres’ art to the sheets of amate tree bark used by pre-Hispanic communities as paper, though the Indigenous precursor was not dyed. Others say the careful cuttings originated in China, and were brought to Mexico by the Spaniards. Either way, researchers agree that it symbolizes the union between life and death. Perhaps for that reason, the scenes that Torres represents are skulls or skeletons dancing or eating.  MUSIC OVER THE TOMBS  While some older Mexicans remember hearing only the murmur of prayers characterizing the Day of the Dead, today mariachi music can be heard over the decorated tombs of many cemeteries. José García, a 60-year-old shoe shiner from San Antonio Pueblo Nuevo, a township 90 miles (140 kilometers) west of Mexico City, said people with money would bring a group of musicians to the cemetery to toast with their departed loved ones and listen to their favorite songs. But, he adds, one doesn't have to have money to enjoy the music. Some people just bring “their recordings or their horns,\" he said.   PHOTOS OF THE DEPARTED  Day of the Dead is one of Mexico’s great visual spectacles — and a celebration of cultural syncretism. All the while, its fundamental purpose is to remember those who have died so their souls don’t disappear forever. Photos of the departed loved ones take the most important spot on the altar. Colors fill everything. The bright orange of the cempasúchil, the black of the underworld, the purple of the Catholic faith, red for warriors and white for children. Remembrance is not only individual, but collective. Some more political altars in the country’s main public university, the National Autonomous University of Mexico, remembered murdered students and the Palestinian dead in the Israel-Hamas war. Elsewhere remembrance is institutional, like the offering in the capital’s Zócalo in honor of the revolutionary Pancho Villa on the centenary of his death. Beyond the visual spectacle, the important thing is to “get into” the offering, to connect with the past and go beyond the senses, insists Ramírez. “It’s not something they explain to you,\" he says. \"From the moment you are born and experience the celebration, it's in your DNA.” ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

        "description": "Charles’ thoughts and prayers are with all of those suffering and he has asked to be updated on the situation, Buckingham Palace said.",
        "text": "The King is “appalled” by and condemns the “barbaric acts” of terrorism in  Israel , Buckingham Palace has said. Charles  is said to be “extremely concerned” about the situation and has asked to be actively updated in the wake of Hamas’ attacks. A Palace spokesman said the monarch’s thoughts and prayers were with all of those suffering, especially those who had lost loved ones. Israel has vowed unprecedented retaliation against the  Palestinian  militant group  Hamas  after its fighters stormed through the border fence on Saturday and shot hundreds of Israelis in their homes, on the streets and at an outdoor music festival. The Israeli government has launched a major retaliation of air strikes on Gaza and stopped the passage of food, water, fuel and medicine into the territory. The conflict has already claimed at least 2,100 lives on both sides, with fears it could escalate further. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “This is a situation His Majesty is extremely concerned about and he has asked to be kept actively updated. “His thoughts and prayers are with all of those suffering, particularly those who have lost loved ones, but also those actively involved as we speak.” He added: “His Majesty is appalled by and condemns the barbaric acts of terrorism in Israel.” Charles, as the Prince of Wales, carried out his first official tour of Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories in 2020. It marked the highest-level visit by a member of the monarchy to Israel and the Palestinian areas. He visited the grave of his grandmother Princess  Alice , who was famed for offering refuge to Jewish people during the Second World War in Nazi-occupied Athens. Her bravery was recognised by Israel which in 1993 posthumously bestowed the title of Righteous Among The Nations on her. The princess – who was the mother of Philip, the late Duke of Edinburgh – is buried at the Church of St Mary Magdalene in Jerusalem. The King’s son, then the Duke of Cambridge, toured Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories in 2018. William met separately with both the then-Israeli president Reuven Rivlin and the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas,. He was urged by Mr Rivlin to take a “message of peace” to Mr Abbas to encourage him to take the “first step” to end the “tragedy” between their people.",

        "title": "Hezbollah radios explode, injuring hundreds in new blasts tied to Israel",
        "text": "This story was updated to add new information . LONDON − Hundreds more people were reported injured in Lebanon on Wednesday in what appeared to be a second wave of blasts involving communication devices used by Lebanon's Hezbollah group, media reports said. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said the blasts involved walkie-talkies used by the group and pagers. Some of the explosions reportedly took place inside homes in Beirut and at least one happened at a funeral. At least nine people were reported killed and 300 injured in the latest attack, on top of the 12 dead and thousands hurt on Tuesday. Earlier Wednesday, multiple reports said Israel's Mossad spy agency planted small amounts of explosive material in  Hezbollah pagers  that detonated across Lebanon on Tuesday. More:  Hundreds of Hezbollah pagers explode across Lebanon injuring thousands The coordinated blasts Tuesday emanated from hand-held wireless communication devices as people shopped for groceries, sat in cafes and drove in cars, leaving blood-splattered scenes. The hand-held radios were purchased by Hezbollah five months ago, around the same time that the pagers were bought, a security source told Reuters. Lebanon's government and Hezbollah, an Iran-backed group with headquarters in Beirut that appears close to fighting an  all-out war with Israel , said Israel orchestrated the operation that wounded nearly 3,000 people. Many of those injured are believed to be Hezbollah fighters who use the pagers because they are difficult to track. Israel has not publicly commented on the attack or speculated who was behind it. But Israeli and U.S. sources told Reuters news agency and The  New York Times  that Israel carried out the operation by hiding explosive material within a batch of pagers that were imported into Lebanon. The Times said Hezbollah ordered the pagers from a Taiwanese firm named Gold Apollo. Gold Apollo denied in a written statement that it was involved in the production of the pagers. It said that it only licensed out its brand to a Hungarian company named by BAC Consulting KFT. \"The product was not ours. It was only that it had our brand on it,\" Gold Apollo founder and president, Hsu Ching-kuang, told reporters at the company's offices in the northern Taiwanese city of New Taipei, Reuters reported. That firm, which appears to be based in Hungary's capital Budapest, could not immediately be reached for comment and a website belonging to the company also appeared to be offline Wednesday. Hungary's government issued a statement saying the company has no production or operational facilities in the country. Several sources told Reuters that Israel's plot was months in the making and the devices were modified at the production level. About 3,000 Hezbollah pagers detonated simultaneously, Reuters reported, when a coded message was sent to them, activating the explosives. USA TODAY could not independently confirm those reports. Since Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, Israel and Hezbollah have swapped near-daily tit-for-tat strikes as the militant group has rallied to support its ally in Gaza. Israel has also undertaken targeted assassinations of senior Hezbollah commanders in Lebanon. Tens of thousands of Israelis who live near Lebanon's border have evacuated amid the exchanges. Israel has vowed to make it safe for them to return. \"Hezbollah wants to avoid an all-out war. It still wants to avoid one. But given the scale, the impact on families, on civilians, there will be pressure for a stronger response,\" Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center told Reuters. The Shia militant movement said Wednesday it had attacked Israeli artillery positions with rockets.",

        "title": "Gove accuses UK university protests of ‘antisemitism repurposed for Instagram age’",
        "text": "Communities secretary Michael Gove says Gaza protests at British universities are ‘alive with anti-Israel rhetoric and agitation’ Pro-Palestine university protests are espousing “antisemitism repurposed for the Instagram age”,  Michael Gove  has said in a speech about countering extremism. The communities secretary accused encampments at British universities of being “alive with anti-Israel rhetoric and agitation” that was “deeply, profoundly intimidatory to Jewish students and others”. Speaking at the JW3 community centre in north London on Tuesday, he named academics and university encampments who he said were using rhetoric “hostile” to Jewish students. He mentioned graffiti at Leeds University that he said accused a faculty of funding “an effing genocide” and which said Israel was harvesting Palestinian organs. He also pointed to posters at a Bristol University encampment that claimed the media and politicians were “Zionist funded”, as well as a proclamation at the Soas University of London that the student union was “a historically anti-Zionist space with a duty to uphold BDS [boycott, divestment and sanctions]”. “Yet again telling Jewish students that they are not welcome unless they deny their own identity,” Gove said. “Antisemitism repurposed for the Instagram age.” He added: “How can Jewish students experience this as anything other than the most direct hostility and hate? And how can we allow it to continue unchallenged?” Gove urged all universities and public bodies to sign up to a charter against antisemitism, adopt the  IHRA definition  of antisemitism and make clear that “antisemitic agitation will be met with clear disciplinary action”. He said that among other actions, the government had to bolster the role of its independent adviser on antisemitism, and pledged to establish a parallel independent adviser on anti-Muslim hatred. Gove also denounced the organisers of the fortnightly pro-Palestine protests in London for not doing more to counter antisemitic material and the intimidation of Jewish people. He endorsed a recommendation by the review on political violence and disruption, which is being published on Tuesday by the former Labour MP John Woodcock – now the crossbench peer Lord Walney, that the organisers of those marches should contribute to the cost of policing them. Gove argued that antisemitism was the “canary in the mine” for the health of democracy and the whole political system. He said there was evidence that the extreme left, hard right and Islamists were sharing common platforms and converging “on antisemitic tropes, language, ideas and agitation”. He concluded: “We must not be silent. We must not let tolerance for different views become a moral relativism that refuses to defend the democratic principles and traditions we cherish in this country. “We must say to every Jewish citizen in this country: your safety is the best guarantee of our security. Your freedom to live as you choose is the only way that we can be certain we remain a land of liberty.” Asked about the increase in anti-Muslim hatred since Hamas’s attack on Israel on 7 October, Gove said he was “deeply concerned about it”, adding: “Some of those who are most intent on dividing Muslims are the people who attempt to weaponise antisemitism.” Asked about the international criminal court prosecutor’s decision to seek an arrest warrant against the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Gove said it was “wrong to project any sort of moral equivalence between Israel and Hamas”. Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader and shadow communities secretary, said: “Michael Gove is right that most people on these marches have been protesting peacefully and lawfully, but we cannot tolerate the hateful minority and the appalling incidents of antisemitism.” Ben Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, said: “Nobody truly committed to antiracism and to suppressing hatred is going to take any lessons from Michael Gove. “That he should choose to issue his speech at a moment when Israel is on trial in the world’s highest court for the crime of genocide and the day after its leader has been threatened with arrest warrants for war crimes from the ICC, is grotesque, but given his track record, unsurprising.” A spokesperson for the Union of Jewish Students welcomed the focus of Gove’s speech and said vice-chancellors “must take swift and decisive action to end the wave of antisemitic hate on campus which has been allowed to flourish since 7 October”.",

        "title": "Release of kidnapped Israelis is delayed by 24 hours after hawkish Netanyahu vowed to 'obliterate' Hamas - as anguished families reveal it's 'like Russian roulette' to see if their loved ones will be freed",
        "description": "",
        "text": "No Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza will be released before Friday despite the two sides having agreed to a truce, Israel's national security adviser has revealed. Officials say negotiations for the four-day ceasefire and release of kidnapped Israelis are 'advancing and continuing', but the 10 women and children who were expected to be freed tomorrow will now not be released until Friday. It was not immediately clear if the deal between Israel and Hamas blew up or if the delayed release of hostages stems from a technical matter. News of the delay broke just hours after  Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  vowed during a televised news conference to 'rescue all hostages held by Hamas' and 'obliterate' the terrorist group. Netanyahu, joined by the two other members of his special war cabinet, also revealed that following the four-day ceasefire, the war would resume and continue 'until we achieve all our goals'. Israel's goals are to destroy Hamas' military capabilities and return all 240 hostages held captive in Gaza.         Netanyahu (pictured) addressed the families of the hostages and said since the beginning of the war, he has not stopped thinking about them and their loved ones, adding that 'we will rescue all hostages held by Hamas'             Hospitals across Israel are on standby to receive the 50 or so hostages that will begin to arrive over the next four days when a four-day ceasefire starts at 10am tomorrow (pictured: photos of hostages in Tel Aviv's Museum of Modern Art)             Palestinians wait before leaving northern Gaza through a humanitarian corridor             Israeli smoke ammunition fired by Israeli troops on the northern part of Gaza on November 22             An Israeli soldier returns from the Gaza Strip on Wednesday ahead of the four-day ceasefire             Volunteers provide hot food for soldiers at a fortified forward observation post overlooking the border with Gaza on Wednesday             Smoke from Gaza City fills the sky in the distance as an Israeli tank heads towards the Gaza strip on Wednesday Last night, in a dramatic announcement Netanyahu's office revealed that the ten kidnapped children and mothers who were supposed to be released tomorrow, 'will not be released before Friday.'  'The contacts on the release of our hostages are advancing and continuing constantly,' National Security Council Director Tzachi Hanegbi said in a statement.  'The start of the release will take place according to the original agreement between the sides, and not before Friday.' Hanegbi gave no further details and did not mention any change to the truce agreed with Hamas and approved by Israel's cabinet early Wednesday, which an Israeli official earlier said would go into effect from 10am on Thursday.  His statement also came just minutes after Israeli officials notified journalists that a media centre would open in Tel Aviv at noon on Thursday 'to cover the return of the hostages'. Under the approved deal, Israel and Hamas agreed on a four-day ceasefire during which Hamas would free at least 50 of the hostages taken in their deadly October 7 attack. In turn, Israel would release at least 150 Palestinian prisoners and allow more humanitarian aid into the coastal territory after more than six weeks of bombardment, heavy fighting and a crippling siege. The hostages to be freed in the process are women and children, and the Palestinian prisoners are women and male detainees aged 18 and younger. Israel said the exchange would take place in two phases. In a first step, 50 hostages and 150 Palestinian prisoners are set to be released during the truce. If successful, a second phase could see 150 more Palestinian prisoners freed in exchange for another 50 hostages during an extended truce, the Israeli government said. Netanyahu, addressing the families of kidnapped Israelis on Wednesday, said that since the beginning of the war, he has not stopped thinking about them and their loved ones. He also reassured them that 'we will rescue all hostages held by Hamas'.  He also revealed that the truce deal was reached due to the exerted 'massive military pressure' on Hamas as well as diplomatic efforts from his government. He added: 'I want to be clear. The war is continuing. The war is continuing. We will continue it until we achieve all our goals.' Although the  four-day truce marked the  first major diplomatic breakthrough in the conflict, Netanyahu revealed on Wednesday that during the ceasefire, the IDF will prepare to continue the war. He reiterated: 'We are winning and we are going to continue to fight until we reach absolute victory.'              The hostages – some of the 239 seized in the October 7 raid by Hamas – are expected to include Irish-Israeli Emily Hand (pictured), nine, and Avigail Mor Idan, three, whose parents were killed in the terror attack             Around 40 are believed to be children aged 18 years or younger, and they include a nine month boy called Kfir Bib, while the Red Cross is expected to visit those hostages that remain in Gaza (pictured left, father of Emily Hand, and right, mother of hostage Almog Meir)             A screen grab of a video released by the Israeli army on November 19, 2023 shows security camera footage of what they say were the Islamic militants of Hamas bringing in a hostage from Israel into the Shifa hospital on the day of the October 7 attack             Israel's military patrols near Al Shifa Hospital compound in Gaza City             Journalists and Israeli men take cover during a Hamas rocket alert near the border with the Gaza Strip on Wednesday             Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, Israel's chief military spokesman stand among weapons that, according to Israel's miliitary, were found at Al Shifa Hospital compound in Gaza             Israeli tanks operate in Gaza City, amid the ongoing ground operation of the Israeli army against Hamas             Israeli soldiers patrol near the Gaza border on Wednesday ahead of the four-day ceasefire             A young man looks at the rubble of a house after an Israeli strike in Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip on Wednesday Meanwhile the director of  Israeli 's spy agency Mossad was in  Qatar  tonight to receive a list with the names of the first ten hostages released by  Hamas . David Barnea was expected to be handed the names and the group – mainly women and children – who were due to cross from  Gaza  into  Israel  via the Rafah crossing tomorrow. It is unclear at this time if he has been given the list. The hostages – some of the 239 seized in the October 7 raid by Hamas – are expected to include Irish-Israeli Emily Hand, nine, and Avigail Mor Idan, three, whose parents were killed in the terror attack. Hospitals across Israel are on standby to receive the 50 or so hostages that will begin to arrive over the next four days when a four-day ceasefire starts at 10am tomorrow.    \n   Around 40 are believed to be children aged 18 years or younger, and they include a nine month boy called Kfir Bib, while the Red Cross is expected to visit those hostages that remain in Gaza. In return, around 300 Palestinians will be freed from jail – mostly teenagers jailed for rioting and stone throwing but also several women, who have been convicted of attempted murder. In his speech tonight, Netanyahu said: 'We've defined the goals of this war very clearly to obliterate Hamas, to release our hostages and to guarantee the day after Hamas, Gaza will no longer pose a threat on Israel.' As for the ceasefire deal, the Israeli PM said: 'At this point in time we can achieve the release of babies and children, mothers and woman with a sword literally at their neck. 'We are not waiting. We are seizing each and every opportunity to release our hostages because to bring them back home is a sacred mission.' When addressing the hostages' families, the prime minister said that when he meets with them, they always wear pictures of their loved ones attached to their chest, right over their heart.  'My colleagues and I we look at each and every picture. These pictures are a call for action,' he added. Netanyahu highlighted that the negotiations for the ceasefire deal were 'very tough'. He added: ' I just recently spoke with President Biden a few minutes ago and I thanked him for everything he did in order to improve the outline of the deal.' US and Qatari officials had helped broker the deal between Israel and Hamas to release hostages during a temporary ceasefire. Netanyahu said he believes that the combination of military pressure and diplomatic efforts will 'enable the release of more hostages in the next stage'.  Professor Hagai Levine, who is dealing with the medical needs of the released hostages, said: 'We have been waiting for this moment for six weeks and we have to remember that these people have been kept in darkness and without medicine.

'These people were dehumanised by the terrorist attack on October 7 and we need to get them back to normal as quickly as possible and give then all the help we can.'    \n   Although the deal between Hamas and Israel has been weeks in the making and was approved by Netanyahu's government early this morning some have opposed it. Hardline National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who wants to introduce the death penalty for terrorists - much to hostage families' fears, slammed the deal. In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, he wrote it was a 'dangerous precedent' that 'repeated past mistakes' – referring to the deal that saw Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit freed in 2011 after being held by Hamas for five years. He added: 'We have a moral duty to bring everyone back, and we have no right or permission to agree to the idea of separating them and only bringing some back.' Mr Ben Gvir criticised the deal for not securing the release of all women and children and branded it 'immoral, illogical and very far from enough 'adding it 'should have been done different'. He went on: 'Hamas wanted this truce more than anything, it also wanted to get rid of the women and children in the first stage because they caused international pressure. 'It wanted to get in exchange fuel, the release of terrorists and even reconnaissance flight ban. It got all of those.' Meanwhile a British-Israeli woman whose mother was released by Hamas terrorists last month but whose father is still held welcomed the deal to release hostages and insisted it must be 'women and children first.'             Israeli soldiers climbed down an opening to a tunnel at Al Shifa hospital             A convoy of Palestinian ambulances waits on a road leading to Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza             Israeli soldiers secure a tunnel underneath Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza City             Palestinians gather at Al Shifa Hospital compound in Gaza and camp on the street outside             Weapons that, according to Israel's miliitary, were found at Al Shifa Hospital compound             An Israeli soldier secures a tunnel underneath Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza Sharone Lifschitz has been waiting for news which will bring an end to her unbearable heartache. Her mother Yocheved, 85, was released by Hamas almost four weeks ago but her father Oded, 83, is still being held was 'hopeful' of a deal. Mrs Lifschitz said: 'Everyone is incredibly anxious at the moment, but I think it must be the children who go first and they shouldn't be separated from their mothers. 'But this is all part of Hamas plan to put us through an impossible situation, it's a form of psychological torture.' 'All we can do is pray that my father will be released soon because I don't think he will be able to last much longer, everyone who has some held is completely devastated and we hope this is the start of some good news.' Hours after Israel approved a hostage swap deal, Maayan Zin, whose daughters are being held in Gaza, struggled to digest the news. The long-awaited deal, which would initially apply to women and children, has given hope to anguished families desperate for news. Zin admitted it had let her 'cautiously' dare to dream about being reunited with her daughters - eight-year-old Ela and 15-year-old Dafna. In her most optimistic dreams, she imagines snuggling up with Ela and going on shopping sprees with Dafna to buy 'crop-tops, mini-skirts, heels and flashy yellow fake nails', she said while sitting at her home in Kiryat Ono, near Tel Aviv. Also on the shopping list: a new nose ring. Since the siblings were snatched, the only proof of life has been a photo published by Hamas on Telegram showing Dafna seated on a mattress in pyjamas with an Arabic caption saying: 'Better in a prayer robe'. In the picture, the nose ring Dafna normally wore was gone. 'Yesterday, I had nothing. I was in total darkness. Now I can see a ray of light which warms me. And I'm just waiting,' Zin said.              Hours after Israel approved a hostage swap deal, Maayan Zin (pictured), whose daughters (left and right) are being held in Gaza, struggled to digest the news             Zin admitted it had let her 'cautiously' dare to dream about being reunited with her daughters - eight-year-old Ela (left) and 15-year-old Dafna (right)             In her most optimistic dreams, she imagines snuggling up with Ela and going on shopping sprees with Dafna             One of the paintings in Tel Aviv focuses on four-year-old Raz Asher and states: 'Time is running out. Bring her home' The girls were taken while spending the last few days of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot on kibbutz Nahal Oz near the Gaza border with their father, Zin's ex-husband Noam. When the militants stormed the kibbutz, Noam and his partner Dikla were shot dead along with her 17-year-old son Tomer from a previous marriage, their bodies dumped nearby. And the two girls were snatched and taken to Gaza. Even if the promised release of 50 hostages has given her hope, Zin is trying to remain level-headed.    \n   So far the names of those who are to be freed during the ceasefire have not been published, with the lists of those slated for release only likely to be made available the night before, Israeli officials said. 'I'm afraid of being disappointed... I don't want to get ready for them to come home on Thursday only to find out that it's others who will be coming back,' Zin said. 'And I don't want to be disappointed that other people are coming back either. I want to be able to be happy for them,' she said, describing herself as 'cautiously optimistic'. At this stage, she is only focusing on information directly from the Israeli authorities. 'If I follow everything going on in the media, I'm likely to fall apart,' she said. And she is worried about what her girls might have gone through. 'Maybe they will come back traumatised, maybe they won't be able to speak,' she said. 'Or maybe they will come back more grown up, or very sad or scared.' She also wonders what she will say to them. 'What questions to ask, how to ask them, how often, or maybe whether I should even be asking at all,' she wonders aloud. 'I just have no idea what happened to them while they've been in captivity.' This comes as Israel's Ministry of Justice today published a list of 300 names of Palestinians who said would be considered for release.

Despite the impending ceasefire rockets continued to be fired towards Israel from both Gaza and Lebanon and the air force also intercepted a cruise missile over the south of the country that had been fired from Yemen. Israeli officials said they welcomed the 'pause in fighting' they pledged to continue the war in order to return home all of the hostages, complete the elimination of Hamas and ensure that there will be no new threat to the State of Israel from Gaza'. The Israeli Defence Force said fighting was continuing around Gaza City and soldiers had 'eliminated terrorists and located workshops for the production of anti-tank missiles, a laboratory for drones, explosives and other weapons'. The Hamas-run Health Ministry says that more than 14,000 people have been killed in Gaza while Israel has lost 391 soldiers, with 69 since the ground operation began late last month.",

        "description": "Benghazi veteran Mark 'Oz' Geist advised the group to head for the border with Jordan",
        "text": "14 Americans unaccounted for in Israel   FOX News’ Steve Harrigan reports on Israeli families discovering their loved ones were taken hostage through social media posts.   A tour group of dozens of U.S. Christians was successfully evacuated  from Israel  after finding themselves stuck in Bethlehem as a war broke out around them, according to leaders.         \n        \n       A church group of about 84 people out of the Diocese of  West Fargo, North Dakota , was forced into a change of plans during a trip to Israel last week after a Hamas surprise attack on the country, forcing them to find a way from their hotel in Bethlehem to the border of Jordan to escape the sudden conflict zone. Father Gerald Braun, one of the Catholic priests leading the group, told Fox News Digital that what started off as a normal trip unraveled on the Saturday when Hamas terror attacks were unleashed, sparking Israel to declare war.     The tour group's first hint something was amiss came when they attempted to make a stop at the site of Jesus' baptism on the Jordan River but were turned around at the entrance and told the area was closed, Braun said. From there, the group tried to make its way to a stop in Jericho instead, but learned that was closed as well.     \n        \n       Members later found out about the outbreak of fighting, the pastor said.

(Chris Graythen/Getty Images for Texas Motor Speedway/Father Phil Ackerman) While the group did not know the severity of the situation yet, they were reportedly told that they would be transported to their hotel in Bethlehem, an apparently safer place away from  the conflict . Once there, members of the group began receiving communications from loved ones back home alerting them to the situation developing around them.     \n        \n       Unsure of what to do, Braun and another priest leading the pilgrimage, Father Phil Ackerman, began reaching out for help from the State Department, the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and North Dakota Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer. \"Everybody was trying to find a solution,\" Ackerman said of the government leaders he spoke with.     However, a quick solution was not in the cards as the situation rapidly deteriorated throughout the region, forcing the tour group into a holding pattern, he said. While the group initially thought it  would travel  from Bethlehem to Tel Aviv for a return flight, it started to become unclear if any flights would still be available if they made the journey there, he added.         \n        \n       That lack of clarity had some family members back home worried, including John McDonald, an expert in crisis management whose sister was one of those stuck in Bethlehem. McDonald told Fox News Digital that he made contact with Mark \"Oz\" Geist, a  U.S. Marine Corps  veteran who was one of the American contractors who famously fought off a 13-hour assault in Benghazi in September 2012.

(Father Phil Ackerman)         \n        \n       \"I was getting text message from my sister that were pretty panicked about what was going on,\" McDonald said. \"We were providing updates, just based on what we had seen on Fox News at that point. And I reached out to Mark and asked if he had any resources.\" McDonald said that Geist got to work reaching out to contacts he had  in the region , which allowed him to provide reliable information back to the group in Bethlehem. \"They were unsure of what to do,\" Geist told Fox News Digital. \"Their flights were out of Tel Aviv… but the arline companies at the time had told them that they couldn't rebook them.\"     \n        \n       With flights getting canceled out of Israel's main hub, Geist said the information he was gathering indicated that the group would likely be safer if they took traveled to the border with Jordan.         Braun told Fox News Digital that the advice to get to Jordan was not an idea they had considered yet, but turned out to be the best path forward. \"We were thinking that made sense,\" Braun said, adding that the group was still hoping to hear back from the State Department, after the initial idea was floated to fly the group out of Tel Aviv.     \n        \n       BLINKEN, IN ISRAEL, SAYS MORE AMERICANS KILLED, VOWS SOLIDARITY ‘ALWAYS’ However, when the group found out Wednesday morning that Air Canada had canceled their flight out of Tel Aviv, they decided to follow advice to head for Jordan.     The group was able to board their buses and make the journey to Jordan without incident, Ackerman told Fox News Digital, with the largest obstacle being a bit of a delay for the group to be processed at the border. The priest also praised the group's tour guide, who he said was instrumental in arranging accomodation and flights for the Americans back home.

(Father Phil Ackerman)     \n        \n       By Thursday, the group of Americans finally boarded flights back to the U.S., but frustrations remained about the process. \"We've got to do a better job giving American citizens overseas that are stuck in a war zone information, intel, and guidance on where to go and what to do,\" McDonald said.     When reached for comment by Fox News Digital, a State Department spokesperson said that it has \"has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas, including U.S. government personnel and their dependents.\"         \n        \n       While the spokesperson did not address the specific incident, they noted that \"the U.S. Embassy in Israel has issued multiple Security Alerts since October 7, 2023\" and have \"a team communicating 24/7 with U.S. citizens and providing them assistance through phone calls and an online crisis intake form. \"We have been advising U.S. citizens who wish to leave and can do so safely to check the status of the border crossings or verify flights have not been cancelled before heading to the Ben Gurion Airport,\" the spokesperson said. \"We are acutely aware of the limited capacity on commercial flights and the high demand from U.S. citizens wanting to depart. Our goal is to assist U.S. citizens who want to leave Israel with a safe means of doing so.\" The spokesperson also pointed toward the possibility that U.S. citizens could depart Israel by taking advantage of \"commercial flights that involve transiting a third country if they are unable to book a direct flight to the United States.\"     \n        \n       \"In order to meet high demand for flights, we are exploring other contract options by air, land, and sea to nearby countries,\" the spokesperson said.     Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., was one of those in government working behind the scenes to assist the group. In an interview with Fox News Digital, the North Dakota senator expressed understanding for the frustration of the families but noted that he was working tirelessly to provide the tourists with a way back home.     \"Welcome Home\" sign at Holy Cross Chuch in West Fargo, North Dakota.   (Father Phil Ackerman) EGYPT WARNED ISRAEL OF ATTACK, HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS CHAIRMAN CLAIMS         \n        \n       \"I couldn't begin to blame anybody for thinking that the wheels of government are moving to slowly when you're trapped in a situation where you're surrounded by violence and uncertainty and understandably fearful,\" Cramer told Fox News Digital. Cramer said he stayed in contact with people on the ground and Bethlehem while working with the  State Department  to find a solution. The senator pointed out that the sudden situation meant the department was suddenly responsible for the safety of thousands of other Americans in the country.     \"The 80 most important people in the world, or at least in Israel at that time, are my 80 people, but realizing there are also probably a couple hundred thousand other people who are the most important people to somebody else,\" Cramer said. \"I tried to have some empathy for how overwhelmed our own embassy was.\"     Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND).   (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)     \n        \n       Cramer said his role became to play middle man, working with the State Department to find a solution while keeping the group as informed as he could. The senator also credited fellow North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, who he said was in \"lock step\" with him on their shared efforts to get the group safely home. \"After hearing from family members of the North Dakotans in Israel, our office notified the State Department about the group over the weekend to ensure their safety,\" Hoeven's office told Fox News Digital. \"Senator Hoeven then followed up directly with Father Ackerman and Assistant Secretary Bitter at the State Department on Tuesday to connect the group directly with the ambassador’s office and assist them with booking flights.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP         \n        \n       Meanwhile, Braun and Ackerman praised everyone who helped work to get them out of the country, including Geist and the  North Dakota senators.     \"Everybody was striving to do their best, to see what they can do,\" Ackerman said. \"Everybody is working from their angle to try to provide a solution.\"     Michael Lee is a writer for Fox News.

        "title": "Hamas insists on end to Israel’s offensive in Gaza before hostage talks can begin",
        "text": "UN security council resolution calling for ceasefire and more aid deliveries delayed again at the request of the US The US said “very serious” negotiations were taking place in Egypt on a new Gaza ceasefire and release of more Israeli hostages, but prospects for a deal remained uncertain as  Hamas  reportedly insisted it would not discuss anything less than a complete end to Israel’s offensive in the Palestinian territory. The ongoing negotiation came as a vote in New York on a UN resolution calling for a lengthier ceasefire and more aid deliveries was delayed for a third time. The diplomacy rolled on as the official estimate of the death toll in Gaza passed 20,000, according to the Hamas government media office, with 8,000 children and 6,200 women among the dead, and as hunger and disease threaten to add to the death rate significantly. The arrival in Egypt of Ismail Haniyeh, a Qatar-based Hamas political leader, on Wednesday was seen as a positive sign of a possible truce, as the last time he came it was before the first deal last month which involved the release of 110 hostages and a week-long ceasefire. A source briefed on the negotiations told the Reuters news agency that envoys were intensively discussing which of the hostages still held in Gaza could be freed in a new truce and which Palestinian prisoners Israel might release in return. A leader of  Islamic Jihad, a smaller Palestinian militant group  also holding hostages in Gaza, was also expected to arrive in Egypt on Thursday for talks on which hostages would be freed in return for how many Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. However, the two sides remained far apart on the question over the lull in fighting to accompany a prisoner exchange. Hamas officials made clear they wanted it to mark the start of a longer truce, while the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he only saw it as a short pause in a continuing military campaign to destroy Hamas militarily and as a political force in Gaza. Taher Al-Nono, Haniyeh’s media adviser, told Reuters that Hamas was not willing to discuss releasing more Israeli hostages until Israel ends its military campaign in Gaza and the volume of humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians increases. “The issue of prisoners can be negotiated after these two matters are achieved. We cannot talk about negotiations while Israel continues its aggression. Discussing any proposal related to prisoners must occur after the cessation of aggression,” Nono said in an interview in Cairo. “We have talked with our brothers in Egypt, outlining our stance on this aggression and the urgent need to stop it as a top priority,” Nono said. Israel has insisted all remaining women and infirm men among the hostages be released, the source briefed on the negotiations told Reuters.   “We’re pushing it,” Joe Biden said when asked about the hostage talks, but he cautioned: “There’s no expectation at this point.” Later in the day, the White House national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said: “These are very serious discussions and negotiations, and we hope that they lead somewhere.” Meanwhile a resolution put forward at the UN security council by the United Arab Emirates, calling for a “suspension of hostilities” and a significant increase in aid deliveries under UN supervision, was delayed for a third time this week on the request of the US. Diplomats at the UN said the main sticking point for Washington was clauses in the text giving the UN sole authority over monitoring of aid truck convoys, with no explicit mention of Israel’s role. Diplomats urging a compromise pointed to UN assurances that it would never send cargo into Gaza without consulting Israel, but the Biden administration wanted the consultation requirement codified in the text of the resolution, warning that it could otherwise lead to complications on the ground and backfire. “We continue to engage extensively and constructively with a number of countries to try to resolve some of the outstanding issues in this security council resolution,” the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told reporters in Washington on Wednesday. He added that the US shared the aim underlying the UAE resolution, to get more aid into Gaza, and had worked harder than any country to make sure it happened. “We continue to work on this every day, for example making sure that once the assistance gets into Gaza, it can actually move around and be distributed safely and securely with predictable routes,” Blinken said. “We’ve been at the forefront of all of these efforts, and we want to make sure that the resolution, in what it calls for and requires, actually advances that effort and doesn’t do anything that could actually hurt the delivery of humanitarian assistance.” US officials pointed to the opening of the Kerem Shalom crossing point between Israel and Gaza as a sign of progress. A 46-truck convoy, bringing more than 750 tonnes of goods from Jordan, crossed Kerem Shalom on Wednesday. “We’re going to keep pushing for more, but this is another sign of how it was important for us to urge Israel to open up Kerem Shalom,” Kirby said. “You’re already starting to see now a tangible benefit to the people of Gaza on the ground.” There was no sign of any letup in the Israeli offensive, with intense fighting including multiple airstrikes in northern Gaza, which Israeli forces have been claiming for several weeks is close to being subdued. In Jabaliya, the Palestinian Red Crescent said its ambulance depot had been encircled by Israeli forces, trapping 127 people inside including workers, displaced people and wounded. There was also continued heavy combat in the south of Gaza, where Palestinian civilians were told to seek refuge at the start of the war. The focus of the fighting was in Gaza’s second city, Khan Younis, where Israeli troops have a foothold in the city centre. As they have done for weeks, US officials expressed the hope that the impact on civilians would lessen and their plight will ease. “It’s clear that the conflict will move, and needs to move, to a lower intensity phase, and we expect to see, and want to see, a shift to more targeted operations with a smaller number of forces, dealing with the leadership, the tunnel network, and a few other critical things,” Blinken said. “And as that happens, I think you’ll see the harm done to civilians also decrease significantly.” The Israeli government is adamant that it will not contemplate a significant ceasefire until it has realised its war aims. “We’re continuing the war to the end,” Netanyahu said on Wednesday. “It will continue until Hamas is destroyed – until victory, until all the goals we set are met: destroying Hamas, releasing our hostages and removing the threat from Gaza.” “Anyone who thinks we’ll stop is unmoored from reality,” the prime minister added. “We’re raining fire on Hamas, hellfire. All Hamas terrorists, from first to last, face death. They have two options only: surrender or die.” Ghazi Hamad, a member of the Hamas political bureau, said that the group was not looking for a brief lull just to cover an exchange. “Israel will take the card of the hostages and after that they will start a new round of mass killing and massacres against our people,” Hamad told Al Jazeera television. “We will not play this game.” In a further sign that the conflict could quickly ignite a wider war, Houthi forces in Yemen warned they would target US warships if they came under fire from US forces. The warning came after the US announced the formation this week of a multinational naval taskforce to counter Houthi attacks on commercial shipping, ostensibly in solidarity with the Palestinian cause.

        "title": "Stabbed Iran International journalist Pouria Zeraati 'feeling much better'",
        "text": "The Iran International journalist stabbed in London has told the BBC he is \"feeling much better\". Pouria Zeraati is now back on screen at the London-based Iranian outlet after the stabbing last month.  He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was stabbed by two men as he approached his car.  Mr Zeraati also said he was in favour of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) being proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK.  Speaking with Today's Mishal Husain, Mr Zeraati said he was recovering physically but \"mentally it takes time\".  Describing the attack outside his home in Wimbledon, the 36-year-old said: \"On 29 March I was going to my car to get to the studio, and a man approached me. He looked a bit suspicious.  \"He pretended to be asking for change, as I was saying, 'excuse me I don't have any change', and I was going to unlock the door, the second man approached.  \"They grabbed me from the front, very strong, I couldn't move my hands.  \"And the first person stabbed me in my leg, and straight away they ran away and suddenly I just noticed all my belongings are with me, including my mobile phones, my watch, my airpods, my wallet, with cash in it. \"So the moment I saw everything is with me, I noticed this is regarding my job because it wasn't a robbery.\" Mr Zeraati was taken to hospital and later discharged. He is currently staying in a safe place under police supervision.  Metropolitan Police said both men fled in a vehicle being driven by a third male.  They travelled to Heathrow Airport shortly after, with police saying the  three suspects had left the UK . Detectives said it was unclear why Mr Zeraati was attacked. The investigation is being led by the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command due to previous threats towards Iran International.  In January this year, the Foreign Office announced sanctions against members of IRGC following an ITV investigation into plans to assassinate two of the channel's presenters in the UK. The Iranian charge d 'affaire in the UK, which serves as the head of its diplomatic mission, has denied any link between the Iranian regime and the attack on Mr Zeraati.   Iran International says it provides independent and uncensored coverage of events in the country, but the regime in Tehran  declared it a \"terrorist organisation\" ,  external  and said its workers would be pursued by its Ministry of Intelligence. Mr Zeraati returned to broadcasting his show on 5 April. \"The show must go on,\" he said.  The Iran International journalist also said he supported the IRGC being proscribed as a terror organisation, but it was nothing to do with the attack on him. The IRGC was set up 40 years ago to defend the country's Islamic system, and to provide a counterweight to the regular armed forces. One of the most powerful paramilitary groups in the Middle East, the IRGC has become a major military, political and economic force in Iran, with close ties to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It supports militant groups including Hamas and Hezbollah targeting Israel and the Houthis in Yemen which have attacked Red Sea shipping.  The organisation also controls the Iranian government's foreign covert operations and has previously been linked to kidnap and assassination plots in the UK. \"Killing people outside Iran, taking US, British and European citizens as hostage... it shows they can be considered as a terrorist organisation,\" he said.  \"The fact that the UK and European Union haven't decided yet, I think is totally politically motivated.\" His view is supported by high-profile Conservative MPs, including Suella Braverman and Sir Iain Duncan Smith, and Labour who urged Rishi Sunak in the Commons on Monday to proscribe the IRGC as a terror organisation in the UK following Iran's attack on Israel.  The move would see the organisation added to a list of banned groups, including Islamists and far-right terrorists.  But Justice Minister Laura Farris said Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron wanted to maintain the ability to speak directly to Iran, which could be jeopardised if the military force was banned.  Former head of MI6 Sir John Sawers told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he also did not think it was was necessary to ban the IRGC and that counter-terrorism legislation was designed to deal with terrorist groups rather than states.  \"Now, if the head of MI5 came out and said 'I really need a proscription of the Revolutionary Guards in order to protect this country against the plotting they're doing here', well, that would be one thing, but I'm not hearing that,\" he said.  \"I don't think the professionals in the government are calling for this. I think it's more of a rhetorical position of people in various parts of the political spectrum looking for something to do without really thinking through the substance of it.\"",

        "title": "Thousands flee north Gaza, Israel opens two exit routes",
        "description": "Prepare for next stage, Netanyahu tells troops; 3rd batch of Indians evacuated",
        "text": "Thousands of Palestinians fled the north of the Gaza Strip on Saturday from the path of an expected Israeli ground assault, while Israel pounded the area with more air strikes and said it would keep two roads open to let people escape. Israel has vowed to annihilate the Hamas militant group that controls Gaza in retaliation for a rampage by fighters, who stormed through Israeli towns a week ago, gunning down civilians and making off with scores of hostages. Some 1,300 were killed in the worst attack on civilians in Israel’s history. Israeli forces have since put the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million Palestinians, under a total siege and bombarded it with unprecedented air strikes. Gaza authorities say more than 2,200 people have been killed, a quarter of them children, and nearly 10,000 wounded. Israel had given the entire population of the northern half of the Gaza Strip, which includes the enclave’s biggest settlement Gaza City, until Saturday morning to move south. It announced overnight that it would guarantee the safety of Palestinians fleeing the area on two main roads until 4:00 pm. (1300 GMT). “Around the Gaza Strip, Israeli reserve soldiers in formation (are) getting ready for the next stage of operations,” Israeli military spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus told a video briefing early on Saturday. “They are all around the Gaza Strip, in the south, in the centre and in the north, and they are preparing themselves for whatever target they get, whatever task.” Hamas has told people not to leave and says the two roads Israel has declared open are unsafe. It says dozens of people have been killed on them in strikes on cars and trucks carrying refugees Friday, which Reuters could not independently verify. Israel says Hamas is preventing people from leaving to use them as human shields, which Hamas denies. In Gaza City’s Tel Al-Hawa neighbourhood, part of the area Israel has ordered evacuated, warplanes bombed a residential area during the night, hitting several houses, according to residents who posted appeals on social media platforms. Hundreds of residents of the area took refuge at the nearby Quds hospital and planned to join those fleeing to the south in the morning. “We lived a night of horror. Israel punished us for not wanting to leave our home. Is there brutality worse than this?”, a father of three told Reuters by telephone from the hospital, declining to give his name for fear of reprisals. “I was never going to leave, I prefer to die and not leave, but I can’t see my wife children die before my eyes. We are helpless.” In Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, Israeli planes struck a four-storey building, killing and wounding several people. Neighbours rushed to rescue people trapped in rubble. “This is a genocide, not a war, it’s genocide. And it’s an attempt to displace the people of the Gaza Strip, but this will not happen,” said neighbour Mohammad Sadeq. “Martyrs are stuck under the rubble and until now neither us nor the medics nor civil defence were able to take them out.” ‘Release of the women and children’ The attacks on Israel plunged the nation into deep mourning and galvanised the country, which mobilised hundreds of thousands of reservists within days. Families of the Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas are terrified for their safety. Avichai Brodetz, a farmer from Kibbutz Kfar Aza whose wife and three children were taken captive to Gaza, set up a camp outside the Israeli army headquarters to focus attention on their plight. “The first thing that needs to happen is the release of the women and children,” he told reporters. “I don’t want to be political, I don’t want to stand here with you. I love my friends and my home and my kibbutz. I hope we can return there and you’ll never see me again.” Israel’s attacks on Gaza have not halted Hamas missile strikes deep into Israeli cities. Air raid sirens wailed in central Israel on Saturday morning and rockets smashed into a greenhouse in Ashkelon and wounded four people at a kibbutz. The only route out of Gaza that is not under Israeli control is a checkpoint with Egypt at Rafah. Egypt officially says its side is open, but traffic has been halted for days because of Israeli strikes on the Palestinian side. Egyptian security sources said the Egyptian side is being reinforced and Cairo has no intention of accepting a mass influx of Palestinian refugees. A senior U.S. State Department official said the United States was working with Egyptian, Israeli and Qatari officials to open the crossing later on Saturday to let some people out. Washington had been in touch with some Palestinian-Americans in Gaza who wanted to leave, the official said, adding it was not clear whether Hamas would let anyone reach the crossing. Countries and aid agencies have sent supplies to Egypt but have so far been unable to bring them into Gaza. Israel says nothing can enter through Rafah without its coordination. The Gaza Strip is already one of the most crowded areas in the world, and Israel’s evacuation order for the northern half meant those fleeing south were forced to shelter with relatives and friends, in schools or in hastily rented apartments. Israel says the order is a humanitarian gesture to protect residents from harm while it roots out Hamas fighters entrenched in Gaza City. The United Nations says so many people cannot be safely moved inside the besieged enclave without causing a humanitarian disaster. It warned on Saturday of the threat of deadly water-borne disease without urgent deliveries of fuel to power Gaza’s fresh water system. Hamas has vowed to fight until the last drop of blood, and says the order to leave the north of the enclave is a trick to force residents to give up their homes. Gaza City mosques have blared calls telling people to stay. ‘Even wars have rules’ The Israeli military said on Friday tank-backed troops had mounted raids to hit Palestinian rocket crews and gather information on the location of hostages, the first official account of ground troops in Gaza since the crisis began. The United Nations estimated that tens of thousands of Palestinians headed south from northern Gaza after the Israeli order on Friday, adding to 400,000 Gazans already displaced earlier in the week. “We need immediate humanitarian access throughout Gaza, so that we can get fuel, food and water to everyone in need,” U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Friday. “Even wars have rules.” The United States has firmly backed its ally Israel, but has called on it to avoid civilian casualties. President  Joe Biden  said tackling the humanitarian crisis was a top priority. “The overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas and Hamas’ appalling attacks,” Biden said in a speech. “And they’re suffering as a result as well.” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on a lightning tour of the Middle East to rally allies, met Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister in Riyadh and was due to travel to the United Arab Emirates. He has already visited Israel, Jordan and Qatar. Stay informed with access to our award-winning journalism. Avoid misinformation with trusted, accurate reporting.

        "title": "Israel launches fresh strikes on northern Gaza forcing Palestinians to flee",
        "description": "",
        "text": "Thousands of Palestinians have fled northern  Gaza  after Israeli forces launched another offensive in the area. Preparatory airstrikes killed at least three people and wounded six more in Gaza City neighbourhoods overnight, according to local health workers, and allegedly buried more under the rubble.  Israel  then moved multiple divisions of soldiers into the Shijaiyah region on the eastern outskirts of Gaza City, before they embarked on multiple raids in the area to root out Hamas militants they claimed were hiding out there. The Israeli military ordered new evacuations from the Shijaiyah region and shortly afterwards, residents in a messaging group shared a video showing large numbers of people fleeing the neighbourhood on foot with their belongings in their arms. But Palestinians and  humanitarian aid organisations  say there is nowhere left for them to go, as the  central and southern parts of Gaza  have, like the northern half of the enclave, suffered significant damage. Israel has designated “humanitarian zones” throughout the Gaza Strip for fleeing civilians but have nonetheless bombed the areas, claiming that Hamas is using the spaces to hide. open image in gallery {\"id\":\"trigger-autogallery-39455\",\"index\":1} Smoke rises following an Israeli air strike in the east of Gaza City this morning   ( EPA ) After striking a building in central Gaza’s Deir al Balah, which was within one of the “humanitarian zones”, the Israeli military said the strikes were because they were targeting a Hamas fighter. “The terrorist operated from within the humanitarian area, which the organisation uses as a shield for terrorist activity,” they said in a statement. The military claimed measures were taken to ensure no harm to civilians. Hamas denies using civilians as shields. In separate “significant” strikes in northern Gaza, the military said dozens of Hamas militants had been killed, with some were holed up in a school and facilities run by the United Nations’ agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA). No evidence was provided over the claim and UNRWA previously denying that militants use their facilities. Hundreds of thousands of people have remained in the north, even as Israeli troops have surrounded and largely isolated it in the search for Hamas. In the south, around the border city of Rafah, where hundreds of thousands of people are still sheltering, residents said Israeli tanks advanced further west into the Shakoush neighbourhood of the city, forcing thousands of displaced people there to leave their tent camps and head northward to the nearby Khan Younis. Israel’s offensive against Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip, has killed more than 37,700 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and fighters in its count. Thousands of women and children are among the dead. Since early May, tanks have advanced in several districts of Rafah, and Israeli forces remain in control of the entire border line with Egypt and the Rafah crossing, the only gateway for most of Gaza's 2.3 million people with the outside world. One resident, who spoke to Reuters via a chat app, said some bulldozers in the Shakoush area were piling up sand for Israeli tanks to station behind. \"Some families live in the area of the raid and are now besieged by the occupation forces,\" he said. \"The situation there is very dangerous and many families are leaving towards Khan Younis, even from the Mawasi area as things became unsafe for them,\" said the man, who moved northward overnight. The war was triggered by Hamas’ surprise attack into Israel on 7 October, in which around 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. International criticism has been growing over Israel’s campaign against Hamas as Palestinians face severe and widespread hunger. The eight-month war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and basic goods to Gaza, and people there are now totally dependent on aid.

        "title": "Vandalism, slurs and a resignation: Antisemitism storm hits Ivy League's 'friendliest' school for Jews",
        "text": "PHILADELPHIA – In the City of Brotherly Love, Gemma Levy sometimes doesn’t feel safe. Levy decided to attend the  University of Pennsylvania  partly because of its long history of tolerance toward Jewish students like her. But with recent events – pro-Palestinian protests, antisemitic chants, university President  Liz Magill ’s perplexing remarks about genocide and her subsequent resignation – the campus hasn’t seemed all that tolerant. “I’ve felt super-unsafe at times,” Levy, a freshman cognitive science major from Brooklyn, said while hurrying to class along the tree-lined Locust Walk in the oldest part of the campus. “It’s a weird experience to feel that way.” It’s an unsettling experience for the city, too. Philadelphia, known as the birthplace of the United States, is where the Founding Fathers met and debated the future of the new country. Founded on the principles of religious freedom, it’s home to one of the largest Jewish populations in the country. The University of Pennsylvania, founded primarily by Benjamin Franklin and now regarded as one of the nation’s premier schools of higher learning, kept its doors open to Jewish students when Harvard and other Ivy League colleges implemented quotas and other measures to limit their enrollment or keep them out altogether. Today, though, Philadelphia and the university are at the epicenter of the clash over free speech and  antisemitism , the  Israel-Hamas war  and the right to feel safe and secure. How did that happen? In Philadelphia of all places? “We’re a microcosm of society,” said Michael Balaban, president and chief executive officer of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia. Antisemitism  is a virus that mutates over time and is easily spread through the prevalence of social media, Balaban said. “We see it online in vicious ways every single second of the day.” Choosing a college is hard:  The Israel-Hamas war is making it harder Antisemitism in Philadelphia has turned up online, on campus and in the streets. In November, the university responded to what it described as “vile, antisemitic messages” threatening violence against the Jewish community. Antisemitic emails were sent to a number of staffers, and antisemitic language was projected onto several campus buildings. The school said it planned to increase security across the campus, including at Penn Hillel, a Jewish student organization. A month later, an off-campus protest by pro-Palestinian demonstrators was widely condemned for targeting the  Jewish-owned falafel restaurant Goldie .  Video  posted on social media showed a large crowd gathered outside the restaurant, chanting: “Goldie, Goldie, you can’t hide. We charge you with genocide.” The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the restaurant was singled out because its owner, Philadelphia-based Israeli chef Michael Solomonov, had raised more than $100,000 for an Israeli nonprofit that provided emergency relief services to Israeli soldiers after Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7. The White House, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and others condemned the protesters’ actions, calling them antisemitic and reminiscent of a dark time in history. Backlash:  Harvard, Penn and MIT presidents ignite furor with 'unacceptable' response to antisemitism Then came Magill’s downfall. Magill and the presidents of two other elite universities –  Claudine Gay of Harvard  and Sally Kornbluth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology – already had been under scrutiny over how their institutions had responded to a rise in antisemitism on their campuses when they agreed to testify last week before a GOP-led House congressional panel. Lawmakers lobbed a series of tough questions at the three college leaders, who hedged when Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., asked whether calls for the genocide of Jews violated their schools’ code of conduct against bullying and harassment. Appearing to sense a trap, Magill and the other two presidents gave carefully worded responses that sounded scripted and lawyerly but failed to directly answer the question. In one exchange, Magill called those decisions “context-dependent” but conceded that calls for genocide could be considered harassment “if the speech turns into conduct.” The  backlash  was fast and brutal. To some, the presidents’ responses raised questions about whether the schools would adequately protect Jewish students. The White House condemned their answers, donors threatened to withhold millions of dollars, and the House committee announced an  investigation  into the universities' policies and disciplinary procedures. Magill tried to walk back her comments, but the damage was done.  She resigned last Saturday  but will remain at the university as a tenured law professor. Scott Bok, chairman of the university’s board of trustees, also stepped down. Julie Platt, the trustees’ interim chair, declined requests for an interview but said in a statement after Magill’s resignation that a leadership change at the university was “necessary and appropriate.” Though Penn has made strides in addressing the rise of antisemitism on campus, “we have not made all of the progress that we should have and intend to accomplish,” she said. Magill, who had been president for just a little over a year, was on shaky ground even before her testimony. She had come under fire in September over a Palestinian writers festival at the university and drew criticism for including speakers who have been accused of antisemitism. Magill and others had raised concerns about the program but did not stop it, citing support for “the free exchange of ideas” – even those that are controversial and “incompatible with our institutional values.” Last week, a pair of Jewish students sued the university, claiming it has become a lab for \"virulent anti-Jewish hatred, harassment and discrimination.\" Author Jerome Karabel, who has written about the history of exclusion at Ivy League schools, said it is ironic that Penn is facing accusations that it hasn’t done enough to quell antisemitism on campus. At some point, all of the other Ivy League schools tried to limit Jewish enrollment. Penn never had any such limitations, he said. “You could argue that Penn, historically, has been the friendliest of the Ivy League schools for Jewish students,” Karabel said. A new level of activism:  Israel-Hamas war stirs free-speech battles at college campuses across US On campus , there were few outward signs of turmoil this week. With final exams under way, students hurried to class on a cold, blustery late-fall morning. Stickers and flyers supporting the Palestinian people and urging a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war were posted on billboards and along walkways and pedestrian bridges. At Houston Hall, which the university says is the oldest student union in the country, a small group of students has been staging a sit-in since mid-November to show support for the Palestinians. Early one afternoon this week, protesters nestled in big chairs and slept under sheets on cushions. Others painted posters and flyers listing their demands: A cease-fire in the  Gaza Strip . The protection of freedom of speech on campus. “Critical thought” on the subject of Palestine. A place for Palestinian studies. “Nobody here is calling for the genocide of Jews,” insisted Clancy Murray, who is working on a Ph.D. in political science. Murray said several Jewish students have joined the sit-in but acknowledged that some feel unsafe in the current environment. Some Palestinian students on campus aren’t comfortable being visible either, Murray said, because of threats and the possibility of doxing, harassment and even violence and hate crimes. As for Magill’s departure, Murray said it’s concerning “that she was driven out” and that “there are a handful of donors who are empowered to dictate what is and what is not acceptable speech on campus.” David Donovan, who was on his way to his daughter’s graduation from Penn’s nursing school, said emotions surrounding the Israel-Hamas war are charging tensions on campus like never before. “We are more sensitive to the feelings of other people, and that’s a net positive, I believe,” said Donovan, a history teacher from Morristown, N.J. When it comes to deciding what constitutes free speech versus hate speech, Donovan said, “we still have to be very apprehensive and think very carefully that our positions are backed by reason.” “We need to err on the side of free speech,” Donovan added, acknowledging, “That’s an easy thing for me to believe as a straight, white man.” The community at large is also grappling with issues of free speech. Some Jewish families are rethinking outward expressions of Judaism, Balaban said. At his home in the Wynnewood suburb, Balaban flies both the Israeli and American flags in the front of his house and displays a menorah in the window. Before, “that would never have been a question in my mind to do it or not to do it,” he said. But with everything that has happened, “in my household, the question was, ‘Are we OK doing this?’” he said. “Of course, the answer is, yes, we're going to,” Balaban said. “But did we worry that someone may do something? The answer is yes. I think we will always display an Israeli flag with pride. We will always display symbols of our Judaism. But there was a pause of what does that mean.” So what's next? How do the community and the university heal after the trauma of the past few months? \"This is a strong community built on a sturdy foundation.  We will come through this difficult moment,\" the university promised in an email message to students this week. The university pledged to redouble its commitment to ensuring that Penn is a place where “intellectual growth is cultivated” and students are “supported as a person.” “Initiatives recently launched to address bigotry and hatred on our campus will continue, and this will be an inclusive and welcoming community for all students,” the message said. Levy urged school administrators to be more proactive and less reactive. “I hope,” she said, “instead of being on the defensive and apologizing after things happen, they’ll take steps to actually stop these incidents in the first place.” Speech police?

        "description": "Cities like Houston, Dallas, Nashville, and Miami are becoming driving forces of economic development in the US.",
        "text": "A major shift is happening within the United States, with new cities on the path to become economic powerhouses. According to a report by Barron's, the economic power is shifting from cities like New York and San Francisco.                 The Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco skyline.(AP)         The report highlights that cities like Houston, Dallas, Nashville, and Miami are becoming driving forces of economic development in the US.       Stanford historian Niall Ferguson has touched upon how America is becoming multipolar with economic power shifting from the coastal power zones of New York and San Francisco.   “You used to have two coastal power zones where you could live your best life, never really touching down in the red states,” Ferguson told Barron's.   \"We now have much more of a multipolar America rather than a bipolar America. That reflects taxes, quality of life, cost of living, the ability to build, and incredibly striking differentials in quality of governance,\" added Ferguson.

They’ve now got more renewables coming out than California, which 10 years ago was insane to think about,\" said Eurasia Group founder and President Ian Bremmer.   As per the report, Miami is serving as the headquarters of companies which are looking to pursue business in Latin America. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has also moved to the city. Miami's airport is No.1 in the country for loaded and unloaded international goods.   Nashville has become a healthcare business hub with nearly 500 companies related to the sector, having base there. Houston is marching ahead with its energy economy.   The report notes that as economic power flows to the middle of the US, it could add to the strength of the country as a result of diversification. However, it may also divide the US further on economic, political, and geographic lines.",

        "title": "Pro-Palestinian activists face complicated new decisions as Democrats gather to support a surging Kamala Harris",
        "text": "Outside the heavily guarded perimeter of the Democratic convention this week, pro-Palestinian groups are preparing for tens of thousands to march in opposition to Israel’s war in Gaza. On the inside, expectations are murkier – as activists push the Democratic National Committee and Vice President Kamala Harris to take a harder line with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.\n     \n            The Uncommitted National Movement, which emerged during the Democratic presidential primary to marshal protest votes against the Biden administration’s handling of the conflict, is demanding the party offer a primetime speaking slot to a pediatrician recently returned from Gaza, as well as a series of policy concessions headlined by an arms embargo against Israel.\n     \n            The mixture of giddy enthusiasm for Harris’ new campaign, which has captivated suddenly optimistic Democrats, and anger among the party’s pro-Palestinian factions over President Joe Biden’s continued support for the Israeli bombardment of Gaza has created an odd, frenetic buzz around the quadrennial gathering. Though little has changed on the ground in Gaza and, increasingly, the West Bank, over the past few weeks, some of the leading progressive groups, anti-war organizers, and Arab- and Palestinian-American activists who were poised to lead the charge in Chicago are facing a starkly different reality from a month ago, when Biden still topped the ticket.\n     \n            “When Biden stepped aside, many of the people in the Uncommitted camp, anti-war voters breathed a sigh of relief,” said Waleed Shahid, a progressive strategist and co-founder of the Uncommitted National Movement. “Then there were some signs of movement. One was Vice President Harris not attending Netanyahu’s speech. Vice President Harris giving a statement that she won’t be ‘silent’ about the killing of civilians. And just, from her, a little bit more empathy and centering of the horrific death toll of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.”\n     \n            Protests over Israel’s war on Hamas following the group’s October 7 attacks have led to large-scale demonstrations around the country calling for an immediate ceasefire. Some of those demonstrations have been blatantly antisemitic, with some protesters voicing support for Hamas, drawing condemnation from Biden and Harris.\n     \n            Since Harris became the party’s standard-bearer, the mood has somewhat changed. Protesters have briefly disrupted a couple of her speeches, and campus demonstrations are poised to resume when students return to schools in the coming weeks, but the movement’s leaders have mostly shifted to quieter means of lobbying for changes in US policy.\n     \n            Harris spoke briefly with Layla Elabed and Abbas Alawieh, two co-founders of Uncommitted, before a speech in Detroit on August 7, with the vice president thanking them for their work, according to the activists. A source familiar with the meeting said she had not expressed openness to the group’s calls for an arms embargo on Israel, but Harris’ national security adviser, Phil Gordon, said after the encounter that the vice president would “continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law.”\n     \n            Addressing Uncommitted supporters after the exchange with Harris, Elabed offered more qualified optimism.\n     \n            “I understand that when (Harris) agreed to meet with me, she wasn’t agreeing to an arms embargo,” Elabed said. “She was agreeing to discuss an arms embargo and discuss a policy that will save lives now and hopefully get us to the point where we can put our support behind Vice President Harris.”\n     \n            In the weeks before, Uncommitted delivered a series of requests to the DNC as part of a bid to center the Gaza issue during the convention. Few were likely ever to be accepted – like a commitment in the party platform to not send unrestricted weapons to Israel, and floor credentials and office space for Uncommitted staff – but the group has pressed hardest for a prominent speaking slot for Dr. Tanya Haj-Hassan, a pediatric physician who has volunteered in Gaza and described the devastation there in harrowing detail.\n     \n            So far, though, there is no indication that Haj-Hassan will be allowed onstage. One source in the Uncommitted camp closely involved in conversations with the party said the DNC received their asks, but has not meaningfully engaged since then. As of Friday, there are not believed to be any Palestinian-American speakers on the schedule, and it remains unclear who will occupy some of the most sought-after speaking slots and what they’ll say – or not say – about the most divisive matter in Democratic politics.\n     \n            The DNC did not respond to a request for comment, but a source involved in convention planning told CNN there has been some uncertainty on the DNC’s end over how to address asks they consider unworkable given the circumstances. Still, the source said, there is a sense of good-faith shared between the parties.\n     \n            Whether that lasts is an open question.\n     \n            “At the convention – along with my fellow uncommitted delegates – I will advocate for VP Harris to support a permanent ceasefire and an arms embargo,” June Rose, an uncommitted delegate from Rhode Island who grew up as an Orthodox Jew, said in a social media post on Friday. “We will make our voices heard in Chicago.”\n     \n            “It’s part of the party, it’s part of their base, and it would be more than a just a goodwill gesture” to allow pro-Palestinian speakers, said Abed Ayoub, national executive director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. “Politically, it would makes sense for them to do it. But it’s not surprising if they’re not. I mean, this is consistent with the party leadership. They haven’t been the best on this issue.”\n     \n            Ayoub, who praised Harris for ramping up engagement with the activist community and for her selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, had been involved in the vice presidential vetting process for Dr. Jill Stein, once again the Green Party’s presidential candidate. He spoke with CNN in his capacity as an ADC leader, but acknowledged submitting paperwork requested by Stein’s camp.  (Stein chose Rudolph “Butch” T. Ware III, a historian of Africa and Islam, who made  anti-Israel comments  on his social media on the day of Hamas’ attack on Israel, for the role.)\n     \n            The more pressing question for Harris’ campaign and party leadership, as the contest enters its final sprint, is whether the vice president plans to propose or offer any substantial changes – or tweaks – to US policy in the region. Harris allies have said her hands are tied given her role in Biden’s administration.\n     \n            Activists see it differently, arguing she has a direct line to the president and, with it, more sway than most.\n     \n            “The message that’s being conveyed to this part of the Democratic Party is that there is no alternatives to sending American bombs to Netanyahu,” Shahid said. “That’s what people are hearing. They’re not (accepting), ‘Oh, it’s the vice president. She doesn’t agree.’ That’s not good enough.”\n     \n            Lexis Zeidan, a Palestinian-American Christian co-chair of Uncommitted and director of the Not Another Bomb campaign, also said the status quo messaging from the campaign, though an improvement from a few weeks ago when Biden was still running, needed more substance if it is going to win back votes in November.\n     \n            “The community is not a monolith. Some are feeling very skeptical, given the nature of how the Democratic Party has acted the past 10 months,” Zeidan told CNN. “Some people really are waiting to hear something – the right thing – so they can support and mobilize behind her.”\n     \n            The desire to see a meaningful shift, Zeidan added, was not about personal feelings, but bare-knuckle politics.\n     \n            “I can’t tell my community that I  ‘feel’ or ‘think’ Vice President Harris is more sympathetic to Palestinians, so we should vote for her. That’s not going to work. People want to vote for something,” she said. “They want to see an end to the madness. They want to vote for someone who is going to end that.”\n     \n            The Uncommitted National Movement, which began as an operation to coalesce protest votes in Michigan against Biden’s policy in Israel and Gaza, has been the most successful among the anti-war, pro-Palestinian groups in engaging with Harris’ team and convention organizers. The back-and-forth between them echoes the mutually beneficial posturing, headlined by the creation of joint policy “task forces,” by Biden’s 2020 campaign and progressive allies of independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders after that year’s primary.\n     \n            But the Harris campaign is also working outside familiar progressive circles, engaging with elected officials and leaders from Arab American and Jewish communities in Michigan, according to sources familiar with the meetings.\n     \n            Those conversations, which were held on Thursday in the Detroit metro area and were in the works for several weeks, according to one of the sources, are the most recent signal that the campaign appreciates the electoral stakes of winning over progressives and young voters as well as Muslim and Arab American communities, which represent important voting blocs in the battleground state of Michigan.\n     \n            Biden campaign manager Julie Chávez Rodríguez and Nasrina Bargzie, a former White House official leading the Harris campaign’s outreach to Arab American and Muslim communities, participated in meetings with Arab American elected officials and leaders on Thursday, according to two participants.\n     \n            Osama Siblani, publisher of the Arab American News, met with the campaign officials in a separate meeting, telling CNN they had a “frank and open discussion.”\n     \n            Osama Siblani, publisher of the Arab American News, met with the campaign officials in a separate meeting, telling CNN they had a “frank and open discussion.”\n     \n            “I delivered a message of great concerns about what is happening in the Middle East,” said Siblani, who met with Chávez Rodríguez earlier this year. The Biden-Harris administration, he told the campaign leaders, “are doing absolutely nothing to stop the genocide as they continue supplying Netanyahu’s killing machine with US made bombs to kill more people.”\n     \n            Chávez Rodríguez and Ilan Goldenberg, another former White House official who is now leading the campaign’s outreach to the Jewish American community, also met with leaders from the Jewish community while in Michigan.\n     \n            “Julie is traveling to Michigan as part of our campaign’s ongoing outreach to communities across the country,” said Harris campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa.\n     \n            Sophie Ellman-Golan of Jews For Racial & Economic Justice, a New York-based grassroots group, told CNN that the unexpected switch of Harris for Biden should not be underestimated – that “space opened up” after the change and movement leaders felt “something other than despair” for the first time in recent memory.\n     \n            “We’re not trying to fight the Democratic party,” Ellman-Golan said. “Elections are about voting for the conditions we want to organize under. We’re actively trying to shape those conditions and the fight around the DNC is about actively trying to shape those conditions.”\n     \n             CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to more accurately characterize Harris’ interaction with Uncommitted activists earlier this month.",
